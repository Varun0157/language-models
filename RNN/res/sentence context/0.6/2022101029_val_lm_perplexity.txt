d artagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth				3843.053831974885
then morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen				1138.3980769107777

the vision had fled and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb they had vanished at his waking				6120750.99325561
milady uttered a stifled groan				615.7529577335681
mercédès remained therefore by his bedside and m morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney piece but availing himself of the doctor s order the old man would not take any sustenance at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercédès if you ever see my edmond again tell him i die blessing him the abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat				441.19673651019434
why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help that is to say stammered milady i am not really very intimate with any of them				55.636786183811665

milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him she was an ardent passionate mistress abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to feel				23090.56155004964
that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the honor of knowing her personally but i know a great number of her most intimate friends				314.0315940806982

planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues				98676.80362792948

it was not known whether after the taking of the bastion the rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it the object then was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports				1865641.5084828716
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned musketeer named athos has taken her safe conduct from her by force she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same time				28.721911362340826

you are a generous man albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter				248.55652874594725

well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required i know it said athos coolly since here it is and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels				5705.202074420849

but d artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall				118.28782863774269

let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal and how he likes but the queen is sacred and if anyone speaks of her let it be respectfully porthos you are as vain as narcissus i plainly tell you so replied aramis				553.5023843319175
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majesty s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty on the contrary sir on the contrary said louis xviii this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled				4966.95818608833
you lose ground you are turning				1761502.3794358901

grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner				219.39084850547223
the spit turned the stove roared the pretty madeleine wept d artagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and love				1725.1852483550674

the handsome madeleine announced to d artagnan that planchet had returned bringing mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit				21423.613581709295
the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your excellency as danglars had hitherto contented himself with being called a baron he felt rather flattered at the title of excellency and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your highness which road asked the postilion in italian				3329.8879427404363
so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all				223.00413700410982

what an awakening for the parisians said the queen radiant				1562156.2028416719
there was to be sure father joseph but his name was never pronounced but with a subdued voice such was the terror inspired by his gray eminence as the cardinal s familiar was called				1093.5903593782411
that s all plain enough				1088.4280896255445
as the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door				34.26061157101252
what a godsend this would be for his majesty who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to recruit for his musketeers he had scarcely finished when d artagnan made such a furious lunge at him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward it is probable he would have jested for the last time				527.5475594080274
she has been dead a year and you know fernand i have subsisted almost entirely on public charity				15410.74632378966

listen he said today is the 5th of september is it not yes today then at eleven o clock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay yes we know that well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house what will happen then why if today before eleven o clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve o clock to declare himself a bankrupt oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man				278.9652726153853
yes indeed the marks are recent quite so replied the lieutenant				89.22287961104145
come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody				72800635.66209489
poor danglars looked so crest fallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air towards him				1272.6700517999436
speak out there s a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise				1035.0869533062378
ah ha whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief but the man in the dark could not find the right key				8929.983945911257

on the way we escaped				2611.6158768203727
the count sat down				115.7693429432251
it was planchet but so completely transformed thanks to the old clothes that the departing husband had left behind that d artagnan himself could hardly recognize him				5.126587246141692
my clerks are honest men who earn my fortune whom i pay much below their deserts if i may value them according to what they bring in therefore i shall not get into a passion with them those with whom i will be in a passion are those who eat my dinners mount my horses and exhaust my fortune and pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune				579.2824486945703
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction				7895.532950299854
and you i shared the same fate at aquapendente do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to franz as the only one likely to listen with attention				1032.4329918216636
impossible said d artagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward				266434.74569465953
is he some minister out of office oh no not at all vicomte athos replied he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him do gentlemen then make verses asked raoul naively i thought it was derogatory so it is my dear vicomte said athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good ones increases fame witness monsieur de rotrou				8195212.555916039
oh no sir said madame danglars but you suppose scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality 30223m ah yes said monte cristo smiling it is all a matter of imagination				1273.1562365953744
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze then in the midst of the songs of his sailors songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down he saw the island of monte cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city				322.9887376082407
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience well asked danglars				1031.7508861014614
no sir and it must be admitted that she seemed very anxious in fact said aramis there is no time lost and we made our journey quickly				1483.2204147541936
and now raoul said he you are launched you have dukes for friends a marshal of france for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens it is not so bad for a novice oh sir said raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my exploits i had forgotten it is that there was with her majesty the queen of england a gentleman who when i pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy he said he was a friend of yours asked your address and is coming to see you what is his name i did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although i thought from his accent he was an englishman ah said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be				235.65524691253006
he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eugénie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck				4730.3921354865815

danglars then opened the window				54.913186841552616
assassin assassin assassin you have still on your brow your master s blood				1868.6221128262384
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room				222.0164427942537
i respect old age but i don t much like it boiled or roasted and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt				2370.394219811347
for very important notes for which closer attention is required i pricked one of my fingers and wrote with my own blood and when asked dantès may i see all this whenever you please replied the abbé				17.16141459957841
the whole establishment had been changed another valet was engaged for himself a new servant for noirtier two women had entered madame de villefort s service in fact everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new faces were presented to the different masters of the house thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family				1790.1558198675111
you would like very well to be at liberty on that beach				26815.142635333985
so much the better				130.47516714107505
instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper s reign officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condé and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god				8156.2075297901965
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels				1676294.2305778281
i am in the power of men upon whom i can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite they know me by heart and are steeled against all my weapons				5521.48250171009
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after albert s departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy				4507928.035609901
isn t it so kitty i do not care where i live said kitty provided i am well concealed and nobody knows where i am meanwhile kitty when we are about to separate and you are no longer jealous of me monsieur chevalier far off or near said kitty i shall always love you where the devil will constancy niche itself next murmured athos				19.268194843667043
the overture to the second act began and at the first sound of the leader s bow across his violin franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl who turned around to say a few words to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on				61.016251770701764
here i am at your eminence s service as well as monsieur du vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of porthos porthos bowed to the cardinal				29.700994060210633

the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened				650.357294920972
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him				1628.2076077914412
oh valentine you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answer soon and do you said valentine depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa yes cried morrel make haste				38838.610357709826

perhaps he can not reconcile himself to the french style of living and might prefer something else oh no i have seen him eat of everything in italy no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening and besides said the countess accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do i do not think that for he has complained of feeling almost suffocated and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the windows in a word said mercédès it was a way of assuring me that his abstinence was intended and she left the room				513.9394639016473
that is my name said athos quietly				2001.7118195493565

this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true				1536.591967711689

on the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the court				351.2502149842726
he soon felt that his ideas became again collected he could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning				81765.85298247972
athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by d artagnan				1.1206176271299102
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded				2722139.91802123
monte cristo shook it coldly according to his invariable practice				160820.60028869018
the duke exchanged a signal with them				132.74862447243646

they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants but how is it that you know so much of these matters i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty sword thrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand it closed an old account ah said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men my lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as i describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you who is it it is monsieur d artagnan that gascon cried mazarin with well acted surprise				275.2591381614506

at last d artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and d artagnan s blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass				1994.1978904833552
thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her and the self satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond				14520.556552058411
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any ill feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties your father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them				229.08704910278607

he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive				1295218.7266873682
as they left paris an equipage with four horses at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained monte cristo				1.0253792997748556
a cup of chocolate i did not ask for it				6.857712366540168
which means that i have just been duped sixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour d artagnan and athos laughed aloud				3371.572774149234
what he asked athos				4.503444370943015
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine				458.0668406870053
it was then that the door of edward s room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared				4808.781502515118
comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened				2415.9534254202204
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them				173.05447248547785
you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say yes sire you will accept his judgment undoubtedly and you will submit to the reparation he may require certainly la chesnaye said the king				14.877753002663315
time passed on and the two young people had agreed to be married when vampa should be twenty and teresa nineteen years of age				501.57441429196217
what more is to be done i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son				212.3563748449665
madame du vallon was of doubtful gentility				544210.9819715538
my dear m cavalcanti said andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father the major was about to speak when andrea continued in a low voice nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me 50 000 francs a year to be your son consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent the major looked anxiously around him				687.5155122422315
but nothing could be farther from his thoughts				217.08056974148766
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man i will let the count know that you are here and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portières				1191198.958746963
believe soft spoken gentlemen again				60.163848438115046
now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table				170.16398997999624
my lord continued felton becoming more excited as he spoke my lord beware				24484.06411162292
the count s well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice				2382.7498844078655
d artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life				320.88686006958875
the rest of mademoiselle eugénie s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of diana as château renaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute				12735.84953741559
now in the army from the division generals who desire the death of the general in chief to the soldiers who desire the death of the corporals all desire some one s death				742.0003594718073
d artagnan here himself but that s impossible				1012.7927569683823
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness				461.0707941051802
at half past one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and albert				349.5109731483078
why he imprisoned himself i swear to you he did				854.9690369705013
do you know that i die to morrow at ten o clock something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible the king looked at aramis with astonishment				45.989385757335725
i am still terrified to such a degree that i scarcely believe my eyes				429.76708069588847
now said the steward what have you to tell me and you said andrea				266.7877605009103
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room and went to open the door himself				254.67859694372842
monsieur d artagnan it cried				316.8101468414631
but his temper cooled down like his friend s he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it so much the better said athos				1585.2975738038356
leave all to me and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied my dear albert said franz leave all to our host he has already proved himself full of resources let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see l italienne à alger agreed returned albert but remember signor pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for the host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes				2332883.8779513594
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle				1790.4853447387736
you were always a merry companion my dear d artagnan he said and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you				9.805322665376558
can we have the honor of seeing his highness i shall be proud to present you and rochefort walked on				40.22975037540112
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercédès that s all right edmond				589.4177185334848
this is not a corsican maquis but an english garden badly kept i own but still you must not calumniate it for that monsieur i implore you do not stay there i think you are going mad bertuccio said the count coldly				6841.999841742329
come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me				6.358449087488858
why are not my frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when dead well said the president seeing that charles was determined to remain silent so be it				1850.7688710092884
two hours passed thus				1707.9725545425963
i should like to have seen his face at that moment that would have been difficult no matter replied de boville in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs no matter i can fancy it and he shouted with laughter				1378.7010885516074
the island of monte cristo loomed large in the horizon				1076.1985014625416
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter he opened a drawer and took out a purse				3188.185854709262
send him away and all will then be well what do you wish me to do oh madame				122.80929508075113
now then said cucumetto advancing towards the other bandits are you coming i follow you 20111m cucumetto departed without losing sight of carlini for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but nothing betrayed a hostile design on carlini s part				9170.235639641296
you see they are going to send a whole regiment against us said athos				6.189437850934414
we are betrayed said the king in a low voice				2.941426345323783
i will introduce you to them but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars				75.35112184959702
do you keep a journal no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself do you talk in your sleep 30275m i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember the color mounted to the baroness s face and villefort turned awfully pale				274.4362281799978
but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida				2674310.0112809804
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us all replied mordaunt				164.71874831174352
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen what is this madame he asked coldly				63577.97308036762
on on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis i came here only to meet de chatillon i have met him i am contented tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul				125.66457533110386
she then made an extraordinary effort to receive him but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile				80.9980752586221
d artagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name				1186.576866445918
question then my lord where did the army cross the lys between saint venant and aire by whom is it commanded by count de fuonsaldagna general beck and the archduke of how many does it consist eighteen thousand men and thirty six cannon and its aim is lens you see gentlemen said the prince turning with a triumphant air toward marshal de grammont and the other officers				31730.69619119547
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with d artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion				554760.9671684206
endure nothing from anyone except monsieur the cardinal and the king				34.32652008624046
the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent				241.300368443966
he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them dantès jailer				2476.823260585438
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence				289503.8630218709
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained				2777.188739863482
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if mme				1033.6009009283773
come let us see what you will do for me everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply				381.0331398352974
but the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept offshore				2897929.472106367
ten minutes elapsed during which d artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second				286.13674385742036
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom				35453.21838978369
after a moment of dumb contemplation during which his face became pale and his hair seemed to stand on end he sprang towards the door crying out doctor doctor				2345.4620407776397
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor				306.76027806543067
he entered and on his way met the waiter				98622.42561831606
come with me then				49.60884193398084
and what did he say to you asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo				817655.8267444656
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken shall i send word to him as coming from you yes certainly shall i tell him that he can count on you to the end and you will leave the command to him of the war yes but in politics you must know it is not his element he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinal s hat in my own fashion you care about it then so much since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing				1927.2629695468256
i have replied d artagnan				1.0179798607291815
she had still four days before her				43.24813813625279
but said the count so great was ali pasha s confidence that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care albert started on hearing these words the history of haydée recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave				8909.959070164261
this is what had happened				350.31519731917814
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber				52.03879053489999
oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune				2214.229146831754
she is all powerful yonder she will help me				19.359595177693777
planchet planchet added grimaud planchet with a gorget indeed ah gentlemen cried planchet so you are back again in paris				1241.0670897558969
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time				86.27838781923552
mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity				2086010.7832282435
i know no one but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery				23857516.03242919
as the carriage stopped at the door and albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a letter				128.15396385843752
i believed him still at brussels oh sir if you know who this man is cried d artagnan tell me who he is and whence he is				315.6863944224608
joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent				343564.2575687576
at that time it was believed that the separation of the musketeers and the guards would be but momentary the king holding his parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after				4434.639197899938
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling				2355.313438284703
will you take charge of our invitation to messieurs cavalcanti when will it take place on saturday m				2529.4454000001965
each had his own particular visit to make				4520.983477895841
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption				273009.9205384642
but the prince de marsillac				3506842.6801722487
the president s sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the general s and had no guard				433.05538558466264
d artagnan and the englishman chapter xxxi				172846.25447254305
dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone				1048.578939361589
valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy				3743949.350987639
the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat				11369.523887593987
thrust it into my mouth my lord thrust it in grimaud prepared to comply with this request when the officer made a sign as if he had something to say				482.605340268353
the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less				11972.612691219312
they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber				136.3243098567185
why thou art posted here by heaven no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses is aramis here yes sir he has been here since yesterday what are you doing on the watch what				414.53475946206555
so soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes				10.58613610962563
you shall be my body guard				1026.1291831494113
my honor will not survive it				16.19396116006984
at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening dantès seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair				908176.8544414508
this battle won by me the king will have no further resources in england or in scotland and if he is not captured or killed he will endeavor to pass over into france to recruit soldiers and to refurnish himself with arms and money				3458.3246415879426
the timely arrival of d artagnan in paris				245.08264915116357
these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so soundly				2195.043907654365
the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing				44136.38372858099
milady s secret d artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to kitty s chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to do and that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches recriminations and prayers the second because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring if possible to fathom those of this woman				904.1108727005403
the presentation chapter 42				288560.61480358173
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court and what are they oh he doesn t stand well with his eminence mouston said porthos saddle vulcan and bayard and for myself monsieur shall i saddle rustaud no take a more stylish horse phoebus or superbe we are going with some ceremony ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit oh				351.7315733647326
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back				214.97383008869377
do not speak so loud young man don t speak so loud				60177.769673651186
the palace of the louvre contains two things the king who must die and royalty which never dies				990666.541953624
it closed after him with a spring				8847.056468615803
i thought my body was my own and that i might sell it				6.207079577088432
the cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon aramis and struck a blow that aramis parried with his wonted skill				359657.93152895273
my death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure where was the monk going asked grimaud				74.10453010820216
the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney				7820.369443249123
say it then if i am in fault i will avow the error the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor irritated him				1936.9809009170945
besides those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of m de tréville who was waiting for them already informed of this fresh disturbance				765.4185596850283
in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her				15.248757640277537
happiness almost stifles me the two friends began to dance around the venerable st chrysostom kicking about famously the sheets of the thesis which had fallen on the floor				8076.782964339221
well does not this tell you that in grief as in life there is always something to look forward to beyond				1533148.6060011543
we must inform the queen ah my faith yes said porthos and d artagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it now inform the queen said athos and how				53916.7225946426
to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service a great service what was that why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor what				406.5070455804595
at the same moment a well known voice above him pronounced these words colonel i want to speak to the people athos shuddered from head to foot				231.19381348881168
d avrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips				58.09997655416084
no false generosity count				761.5460964049263
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs				11053.89675101463
and why your excellency will know when you have read the letter shall i find you here then certainly franz entered the hotel				482.7908559879109
i suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander very likely said albert				50.53788703471616
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athos s lodging and there finish their plans				2515.7783667521853
what are you going to tell me are we quite alone my friend yes quite but why all these precautions because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor				146.97857488687077
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier				4808.607237239129
but that is not all madame				1015.9410785814778
ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents civil war like a forest flame but we we shall remain i have a presentiment that we shall yes replied d artagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion st gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleurs de lis embroidered be it so cried aramis				13.881527057658214
poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away two thirds of her greatness				12188.508996884335
months and years rolled on				104.66821182048902
his name is said she in her turn				49.66658271078483
both were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance				5463.065416083704
was the gascon determined to keep it as a weapon against milady or else let us be frank did he not reserve the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit				4179.36842887409
i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my island shall be free of all charge				10291.177791613893
i have dreamed that the unlucky englishman was dead				233.35322021756437
monsieur d artagnan is my tenant although he does not pay me my rent and even better on that account ought i to know him				44.06530176215039
to whom was this letter addressed to m noirtier rue coq héron no				34.12184326395255
the four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after m de tréville for they were the first to whom he communicated it				12.167727558258285
to say that i shall live here like the mercédès of other times gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe me				4.577324182596197
we are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bastion				3215.413519423109
the prison register chapter 29				424629.7666314719
out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained				3569.8224822650704
well my dear dantès are you now free inquired the owner				280410.0443496895
for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the king s attorney but can you not say that sir				185.6577799922792
fix your own hour for tomorrow and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand francs at ten o clock then if you please i should like it early as i am going into the country tomorrow very well at ten o clock you are still at the hôtel des princes yes the following morning with the banker s usual punctuality the eighty thousand francs were placed in the young man s hands as he was on the point of starting after having left two hundred francs for caderousse				215.11420868408678
monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers by and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed				4805.485290531745
dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement				9731.91091687688
good evening m beauchamp said monte cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be seated beauchamp bowed and sitting down sir said he i just now accompanied m de morcerf as you saw and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together				431.263406403909
alas anything you please				510.53652815150866
i place no confidence in their hypocritical faces				181461.01562835093
if we can not we will do without him				38.64523475775225

franz congratulated albert who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious that they are merited				6112.458444579085
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape				942.830021086364
you are the offended party count doubtless what does that imply that you will fire first i fire first oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that and at what distance twenty paces a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips				268.5839398671578

certainly i excuse you said monte cristo graciously and pocket them and he placed the bonds in his pocket book				9412.192478346178
you will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the great mogul which the chevalier de guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles well monseigneur all the details of his coming into and going out of the palace on the night when he introduced himself in the character of an italian fortune teller you will tell him that he may not doubt the correctness of my information that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears death s heads and crossbones for in case of a surprise he was to pass for the phantom of the white lady who as all the world knows appears at the louvre every time any great event is impending is that all monseigneur tell him also that i am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at amiens that i will have a little romance made of it wittily turned with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance i will tell him that tell him further that i hold montague in my power that montague is in the bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not know exactly then add that his grace has in the precipitation with which he quit the isle of ré forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from madame de chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen inasmuch as it proves not only that her majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of france				3981.5399381029147

it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions				779079.5032133384
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets				568.1358124245328

sire replied the courtier laughing in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of france but i fear i am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt by whom by bonaparte or at least by his adherents my dear blacas said the king you with your alarms prevent me from working and you sire prevent me from sleeping with your security wait my dear sir wait a moment for i have such a delightful note on the pastor quum traheret wait and i will listen to you afterwards there was a brief pause during which louis xviii				5680.391245681814

ah perbacco indispensable were they certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child true said the major there might be doubts raised in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated it would be fatal to his interests it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance o peccato you must know that in france they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity that is the misfortune				2704.913885664859
count said he you have offered us places in your carriage and at your windows in the rospoli palace				218.28109795437717

i could not have thought that there was an englishman in all england who would have required so long an explanation to make him understand of whom i was speaking the hand of the lord is stretched over him said felton he will not escape the chastisement he deserves felton only expressed with regard to the duke the feeling of execration which all the english had declared toward him whom the catholics themselves called the extortioner the pillager the debauchee and whom the puritans styled simply satan				1176654.3275518282

yes yes replied dantès eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé				1962.052853246901
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la fere very good thought d artagnan tis our road likewise we will go together all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones				13087.290142174761
well i was not hot headed then well but what else could you play for				253.38914118179633
and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day				31.548676809662386
you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid i will do better than that said albert my mother is wishing to go to the sea side what day is fixed for your dinner saturday this is tuesday well tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at tréport				1184699.4322141747
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something i was trying said porthos to recall where i had seen that mendicant whom i must have killed and you couldn t remember no well search my friend search and when you have found you will tell me will you not pardieu said porthos				13.330186792100116
madame de villefort remained immersed in thought				958.147904901393
in an hour inquired danglars turning pale				38.60813041525008
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count				1109.1589533631725
beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight				11940.833051950727
the lady with the red cushion produced a great effect for she was very handsome upon the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded a great effect upon porthos who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood a great effect upon d artagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady				731.3656081503785
and i say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes mr				6211.528815052035
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles				3622.9453629394393
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted				2520001.199823452
besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life thus dantès who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth				126057.0258678095
commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work but asked danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalities the contract the settlement the contract answered dantès laughingly it didn t take long to fix that				99.70955832887499
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly looking				280342.92999846966
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more				449.58717505955457
the master of la jeune amélie who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of edmond s value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which edmond had accepted				1365.4257885059299
the first prince of the blood the king s uncle no				70.60850820271278
then i have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees				812210.9167306573
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us				289.7887646544336
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years				442.621193113968
at length the hour drew near				592.8735600256218
but parry withdrew thinking he was dreaming				64341.52155770279
it was danglars letter to the king s attorney which the count of monte cristo disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson french had taken from the file against edmond dantès on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m de boville				32739610.1349436
he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner				45230.98930460317
bonacieux to join her				25.27444451458134
you might have taken lord winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage				358.2181432207698
ah you see danglars said caderousse winking at his friend this is how it is fernand whom you see here is a good and brave catalan one of the best fishermen in marseilles and he is in love with a very fine girl named mercédès but it appears unfortunately that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the pharaon and as the pharaon arrived today why you understand no i do not understand said danglars				41.561996456191565
estafania give up the keys of my drawers and my desks for form s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day				1266.52051011217
he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me and he told you nothing not a word nothing that would lead you to suppose nothing and yet you spoke of him at once ah in such a case one supposes sister sister said maximilian coming to the count s aid monsieur is quite right				346.5419448591963
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o clock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since and don t you know where he is not at all is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell				933.3670416991238
oh it concerns you very closely my uncle i am sure and you will soon be of my opinion added he with a smile which sent a shudder through the veins of him he thus addressed				2781.052987725902
you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid and a brave captain of spahis can not risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world you see my position madame said morrel bestowing a grateful smile on monte cristo				1.0137003656839116
no madame they struck me always struck me				118.62854752597528
but i know you to be a man of honor the count again struck the gong				22359.29690154251
oh indeed i can not permit you to go is it possible whispered franz that you entertain any fear i ll tell you answered the countess				110.33779500993367
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan				67474.62200956985
pardon me my friend if i disturb you said the man with the red handkerchief but i want to speak to you you have no right to beg at night said the groom endeavoring to rid his master of the troublesome intruder				75801.41724935829
on the contrary i gave you to understand i think that i adhered to the princes				15838.64275906635
his eminence will continue to be prime minister and her majesty s favorite if he will grant to me and my friends what we demand for france and for ourselves occupy yourselves with your own affairs gentlemen and let france settle matters as she will with me resumed mazarin				50.44984821816724
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while mme				42.50416535120319
d artagnan who had secured the key shut himself up in the closet without reply				742.7026572941795
she ground her teeth she was of the color of ashes				7859.277789768327
she had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered she could not get out and had heard all				138.78701378839017
but all these reasons were combated destroyed overthrown by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over us				69.01023569740649
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity				2325.8948873544155
at last his patience was exhausted				5659.61628031315
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance				4217.14775629646
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words				1251.6337907345512
i will await you at the corner of the rue du musée and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me then emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation yes				300.23128489849637
the prisoners are escaping cried the sergeant				6208.034770594499
if the cardinal does not hold you in high admiration for the affair of london he entertains a great hatred for you but as considering everything he can not accuse you openly and as hatred must be satisfied particularly when it s a cardinal s hatred take care of yourself				356.32901097584
milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time				573.5396921921057
during the examination of milady by the officer as may well be imagined milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances				9450.463663147506
this news was brought to us				248.32919099702553
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box				807.2497335190887
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of				626.0646257770253
marie michon and what dream does she mean asked the dragoon who had approached during the reading				6236.845168776002
monsieur bazin said friquet monsieur maillard you know who he is he gives holy water at saint eustache well go on well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head				1522.123663668448
but let us be quick the king may change his mind in an hour and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the fort l evêque or the bastille who has got out than to keep a prisoner there who is in m de tréville made his entrance triumphantly into the fort l evêque whence he delivered the musketeer whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him				53.845959945131426
will you speak he said				4.971459173082967
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast				16649.58311826878
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me				6.074691885201012
this duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti				2020447.027634482
we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions				3570.3604255792916
for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun				2081.647480242875
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside they are carved from granite then he added aloud but you have relations left you i have one remaining				945506.1844668589
escape had never once occurred to him				16.79353347819004
yes a base coward murmured d artagnan but she she was very beautiful what she demanded the host				77.33933636409621
you were recommended to monsieur de tréville were you not yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence yes i know that				45.4241153213899
i am but a minister who wants no servants being myself nothing but a servant of the queen s				64.28686608937538
i have however a wish to go and pass a day at blois				15368.125766281206
it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury				31973.769014087648
the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair				203.49188855531295
they were his friends and not mine				3595.286220871306
the baron took the pen and signed then the representative				2001231.9603328523
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge hammer				442553.9131109332
all these he bequeathed to me with a thousand roman crowns which he had in ready money on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that i would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house				913.7598815774701
he was in a most elegant hunting costume and monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him				373.60093518884634
a bargain was therefore struck				5151.665150574346
athos was happy happy as he had never been before				587.3320450624484
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes				65811.51702362318
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo				1.0095868111223834
you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said valentine				393.56319850432436
who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dantès every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice i am he what is your pleasure with me edmond dantès replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law me repeated edmond slightly changing color and wherefore i pray i can not inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination m morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless				2277.823425149859
you are monsieur d artagnan you see monsieur that you say it again but i tell you monsieur commissary cried bonacieux in his turn there is not the least doubt about the matter				181.56910306629987
the next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill edmond hoped he was dying				6365.195561225017
my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me				6.883915037441349
old woman screamed nanette				884799868.2201784
the two friends mounted as did their servants				1587.6835669582804
why to converse with him of course				9462.322751509137
you have suffered a great deal sir said franz inquiringly				20522.740933785397
the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the enemy				1401.7339411137154
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor				5564.114078090785
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father				142.66888649965068
the curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art one of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass				4953.778809005086
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort				52.80829958060179
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep				2540.18341876862
valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was crying				880602.949379358
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings				27772.192869693918
only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel well perhaps				1738.0645057089728
she did well to die poor girl the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention				1737.9493099768076
d artagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it				69.2856530327657
if he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride				32405.28893474278
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbé in a monk s dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages				460969.0563769679
hold sire said d artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute				1164756.1927796912
rely on me to procure you the other i will do my best ah m morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owner s hand m				542.9499255128222
one of them went away and dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement				1442305.1043054643
monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats towards a small table on which were arranged music drawings and vases of flowers				325.3494097075847
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina				5650.200207932163
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat				665.2098268528287
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him				2.977030387956337
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her				25.713249821931964
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend				390.748010444173
thanks to the attentions of raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him				2.655568356148694
and it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to be feared i must have said the duke a proof of his connection with buckingham a proof cried milady i will have ten well then it becomes the simplest thing in the world get me that proof and i will send him to the bastille so far good monseigneur but afterwards when once in the bastille there is no afterward said the cardinal in a low voice				2.33861782542598
it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail				10197.583731624743
he turned ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the street				257.7106500970227
30341m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated				9240.519428819318
the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand				25.44353388514392
ah said porthos what a fearful day my dear d artagnan what				755.0369448825929
yes you are at once from provence and spain that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words apparently uttered with the greatest politeness				13184.36375417444
come in cried athos				4.546809392410396
the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now useless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell				2606.952602662123
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust				33145505.810949933
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer				165.88420389191185
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go oh my god said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right				7266.661478157189
where are you going marechal asked the queen				8.837244370728527
halloo cried jussac advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers				7303.49753892885
when seven o clock came dantès agony really began				3236.0739396772915
this time he had decided to relate all that had passed				1848.1567056210274
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much ill will to follow to the end his role as confessor				35954.629198788025
but whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient self command not to enter				344.1932292948315
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps				440552.4381102789
here father here he said take this take it and send for something immediately and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller coin				5614.790959005792
i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled				8032.958839868651
my fault said he you must be mad				1030.5383834424485
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty				9388.346135356262
the sound of heavy steps was heard above his head				20.681822031863554
franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime				1120304.9474417793
i say i am entirely of porthos s opinion replied aramis				6.872784859248944
i begin and without any rhetoric allow me porthos said aramis				374.4423779795913
the first time he saw d artagnan you have come off well said he to him there is your jussac thrust paid for				365.4410305551888
now that never happened to us when we were four together				992.0775248408144
justice before everything then turning toward m de tréville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window well monsieur continued he you say it is his eminence s guards who have sought a quarrel with your musketeers yes sire as they always do and how did the thing happen				4178.467745009503
three months passed and still she wept no news of edmond no news of fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair				402.26107049179757
and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert				59.27822346644024
but then all this extravagance is not for myself added athos laughing				22.95064044830595

i reply my lord tis but little as certainly i shall not go alone i suppose not				93.1026688483245

my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm				5998.21283286378
often in prison faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive dantès you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion these words rang in dantès ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength				2480.7202164277387
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple question from a friend would have irritated him				4.535585527972641
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively				43413.756796009264
do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said d artagnan to the youth				6018.491322757683

there is but little reason why i should delay you				8.141798400421873

albert is ten minutes after time there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant how imprudent said château renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat				11405.339812507205

where are you running to exclaimed a voice				72.27914942935917
so much the better to that exclamation of porthos s succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door				17.660356704548064
they are worth about fifty thousand pounds				396893.1070806307
you come to demand money of me of a musketeer				831.7962449814281
my dear albert said debray rising it is half past two				1756.3181246748118
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne				9225.796760111503
villefort knew not when he should return and renée far from pleading for dantès hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover				20803.486297926578
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother				270.36810281194676
to see him so self satisfied reconciles me with myself				340.4428949719017
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all how in the wrong said athos				6.753568388578653
it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing				354.65018063200137
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man				1667.7313251009277
we are well aware that this term milady is only properly used when followed by a family name				293.16457992922534

you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured				16983.34313346007
edmond amazed wonderstruck filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles				3083047.5751121617
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself				295.55168459293793
he still felt the same self satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a night s rest				1854.1290060066551
you will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity you laugh faintly				1974341.847236785

oh unhappy woman cried the commissary				3096.9726575876234
athos alone smiled with a self possessed disdainful smile				109.01062457531522
providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month				1365.0696910416439
is this corpse come to life already				10054.79640343585

but all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hôtel				978.017546205019
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy				188899.71742991245
shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the countess				120.90081665437737
villefort had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his study where he received about two hours afterwards the following letter after all the disclosures which were made this morning m noirtier de villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his family and that of m franz d épinay				476.27236015404344
the prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts				176.11426923549172
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father				118.68342972188347
his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life survived				5440628.450280659
you do not know what he is about in the cellar				457.4757321400997

his hand always wonderfully beautiful and strong was set off by a ruffle of lace like certain hands by titian and vandyck				1382524.1257121034
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal				84995.22691408734
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned dantès				76.90623820102967

oh growl as much as you please cried lord de winter but don t try to bite for i warn you that it would be to your disadvantage				42144.722419706166
by that letter which my comrade has in his pocket you see then said d artagnan that i must have that letter				2177.207057671572
but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven o clock of the morning in the month of january sir said planchet you must know but perhaps you ought not to know tell us what returned d artagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains sir said the prudent planchet in the first place are you on good terms with monsieur de rochefort perfectly one of my dearest friends ah				61.12813650974833
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him				2.5768442950769765
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès				563.4866480995099
you knew i should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me 40168m no for i saw god s justice placed in the hands of benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence god s justice				1408.9746272681145
i received this morning five millions which i paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure				4485.57845522043
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like d artagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light d artagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville				64.57009076078471
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass				1418.1367649233116
go to the assistance of madame de villefort he said to the nurse				23181.466028295283
the weather was fine and the game at tennis took place in the open air				141.15999331027902
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate d artagnan who had time before him walked around and re entered by the porte richelieu				1502.0765637246373
you are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal				47.67709862727857
lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers				971.1884121320178
we will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice box you see plainly that i have no sword said the englishman				123.29160318092403
till tomorrow evening then till tomorrow evening then replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital				9982.469056278147
he was a man of twenty five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining				1135731.1317017782
penelon replied julie go and inform m emmanuel of this gentleman s visit and maximilian will conduct him to the salon then turning to monte cristo i hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a lateral alley				3073705.9657613905
will said the notary it is very evident that m noirtier is desirous of making his will yes yes yes motioned the invalid				764.6597776127974
well then at the end of a month when drinking water from the same carafe you would kill the person who drank with you without your perceiving otherwise than from slight inconvenience that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water do you know any other counter poisons i do not i have often read and read again the history of mithridates said madame de villefort in a tone of reflection and had always considered it a fable no madame contrary to most history it is true but what you tell me madame what you inquire of me is not the result of a chance query for two years ago you asked me the same questions and said then that for a very long time this history of mithridates had occupied your mind true sir				1890.7435021740293
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eugénie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera				5541.618290195188
and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on you on them depended my father s life replied she				96.16512269085
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king				41.019230554053806
this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint				67973.35771040364
to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife				1172.5437005384497
my dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account				3328.767134510956
what will monsieur de tréville say				213.89213371898015
silence said d artagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to him				22.74160468718081
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated 10th april 1815 in which morrel by the deputy procureur s advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort s certificates rendered indisputable				595116.0158159976
some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience and the mob retired				1581.1333494406833
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear				1083.2845061878395
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time				33.12641250268642
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips				36.05865449007119
she wore a blue and white striped vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls and a sort of bodice which closing only from the centre to the waist exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps				585260.7847656615
still further in spite of sword thrusts which weaken and painful exercises which fatigue he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of revels one of the most insinuating lady s men one of the softest whisperers of interesting nothings of his day the bonnes fortunes of de tréville were talked of as those of m de bassompierre had been talked of twenty years before and that was not saying a little				2556.9257963138775
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury				752968.9638346934
as soon as possible i am at your command sir shall we return together if not unpleasant to you on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure thus the future father and son in law stepped into the same carriage and morrel seeing them pass became uneasy				2118.200813134734
you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning interrupted mordaunt				203.21010740374555
it signifies nothing whether you eat much or little whether you have ten dishes or one it is always the same price what still keeping up this silly jest				37036.63574645987
carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions				1427.6008016191793
then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves				771.3055823525249
d artagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men				524.4745018438771
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s				17.714583341166183
why did you not accept it because i am not willing to die cried milady struggling				4646578.289485685
i do not therefore wish either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause				1701.506888967399
dantès repeated he edmond dantès yes monsieur villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to morrel are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur said he in the most natural tone in the world				53.01450511269753
how sprightly you are said caderousse one would say you were already in possession of your property no unfortunately but when i do obtain it well i shall remember old friends i can tell you that yes since you have such a good memory what do you want				303.50347688759797
they believe me her accomplice and will punish me with her				73.80953491627754
morrel said not a word				382.1842508545629
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel				22116547.105862927
have you observed said he to them what a blood red color the moon has to night no replied athos i thought it looked much the same as usual look again chevalier returned lord winter				77.58659390592113
this beverage required a good half hour to prepare				14796.672342868345
villefort s dusty garb his costume which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of m de brezé who was all astonishment at finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in such attire				36955.38100380093
sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore i determined to show him to you myself				495.0987381031809
i am john francis de winter he repeated and that woman well that woman was my mother the executioner uttered the first cry that terrible cry which had been first heard				850.5396811827877
excuse me said d artagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him				9.797846986851884
the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière a street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailor but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès				684.7606928192632
you must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it				231.53415971548256
place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of felton				1271.0380485977555
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god				745.6130686578167
bonacieux we shall hear no more on the contrary said d artagnan we shall hear better d artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of dionysius spread a carpet on the floor went upon his knees and made a sign to mme				114.07433093780102
how is it that i have never met you at his house i am no acquaintance of m de villefort s answered morrel but i was of madame de saint méran albert came up to them at this moment with franz				545.8469363885799
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count the pope the life of a man so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne and it was peppino you saved was it not cried morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon perhaps returned the count smiling				46.35593118058079
in the evening julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her father s heart beat violently				638.7265771024663
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind d artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice				162.58188053268302
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you d artagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in milady s soul whose depths were dark and unknown				20135.970293547954
the tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the palais royal entirely				427668.0545190967
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done				139.15930475340951
and i mine said porthos				9.033665881165694
the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage				4341.373470654863
sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here during this brief altercation athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said madame princes who by nature are above other men receive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes				10162.003187108705
mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne horse small but very handsome				3627.782287720552
i your son as you call me i will not let you twas the first time d artagnan had ever refused a request from athos				208.40230838162523
he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under way				2150.2745507766053
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms				378.4174543954034
in the morning it was rumored that prince de condé had evacuated bethune and fallen back on carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former city				282.64231826498707
had you then that sum the queen s famous diamond answered d artagnan with a sigh				51.268636513618176
around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings				33831.69765256488
the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day				190.5028523962985
i do not jest said athos				5.058636439636305
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson				1834782.8859226517
the name is wanting in this commission you can write it yourself d artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it it was a lieutenant s commission in the musketeers				321.9878208771068
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me this threat brought no reply				267.54550532212613
will you dine with me asked harrison of d artagnan				1.1421419395551091
one only is still not in our power and braves us				6892.914001106363
monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts				2053.5612909748756
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened				18216.923023044874
valentine uttered a cry of horror morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown danger				1777.9533760823738
he has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me				356.13961066188733
my safety is now a mere question of speed at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg poissonnière				4375096.1575307185
friend porthos said d artagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and i of my captaincy				2630557.24169211
3 knocked on the head				352.75513746377555
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box yes what do you think of her oh she is perfectly lovely what a complexion				11776.208158717829
then he added in a low tone yes that is the haven and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears				1308.4650255849924
monsieur passed along the front of the line then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments m dessessart captain of the guards as well as the others				1797.6636795222155
the fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off				1168.6592857150495
yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture give me another cutlet no try this hare which i had killed yesterday in one of my warrens zounds				24224.099503138073
he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him				2.0442273246206772
poor fellow poor fellow murmured caderousse				23.861601531052195
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do that is it replied the cardinal dryly				6662.28829417947
oh that is very good indeed it is very good said louise looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envy will they go under a man s hat like the one i see down there you shall see said eugénie				5533.438025191607
the gate once closed and debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked what was the matter with you hermine				3330702.9106148323
his recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnestly				1389.613764575045
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence and d artagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends				129.69347954290694
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said				15.180941587217385
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a tree				1026.9911961974838
my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty one				1091.316533936342
excuse me my lord said the lad but will you have the kindness to wait a moment what for philip asked albert who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance				12802.131293599621
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment d artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity				2737.323217801304
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspector s visit but a dream an illusion of the brain				4851.371259350057
yes if i die well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right				304.777669300327
consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret				4210.183758364706
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before				340.93707887392804
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell				1199.2404578960436
i was dancing the galop at torlonia s with the countess g then he drew his watch from his pocket that he might see how time sped				1168377.4581603014
was not your father a bonapartist asked monte cristo i think i remember that you told me something of that kind my father has been a jacobin more than anything else said villefort carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence and the senator s robe which napoleon cast on his shoulders only served to disguise the old man without in any degree changing him				292.4300571645305
he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hour no change took place				369.84430611759143
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles				6184.781484835871
but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice				1710.33765126289
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them				188.60844333297348
that poor child said madame de villefort when valentine was gone she makes me very uneasy and i should not be astonished if she had some serious illness meanwhile valentine in a sort of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed edward s room without noticing some trick of the child and through her own had reached the little staircase				803.2912618185081
they were four honest soldiers each with a good heart a good arm and a sword at the service of those who wanted it				59.72884919474679
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we have the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes				12.963430546401844
we will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbé here for extraordinary occasions or common wants				3993.73204533238
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them				26.255654974399647
did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter yes d avrigny reflected a moment then approaching noirtier pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation				2781.7864229218876
the king made his entrance into paris on the twenty third of december of the same year				338.2208205822489
he has killed the executioner of bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged de winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head				5.650903576093725
but monte cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes				31.74446477500462
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count s pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting				5597.714126447755
however promise me one thing what is it promise me i say i will do anything you desire except relinquish my determination of finding out who this man is				392.84434605917926
as to the sailors of the pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared				273.4153191715896
but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for that with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home				295.3923357067438
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide willingly my lord				23.22048330075318
i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this continued the jesuit and in his enthusiasm he struck a st chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its weight				3537.0595500881523
comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when d artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal				91.62481147757076
all doubt of his identity was now at an end his singular host evidently resided at rome				631.807974557852
something bright i too cried mousqueton saw them also ah				878.5431281719635
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of henry iv when shall we two walk together athos then said to aramis				49.19773367766523
yes said she it is madame danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us				158.09501013216592
porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the king				59.34641212537168
whilst he thus hesitated the host re entered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot				334.8443733938745
athos is so cool so brave and handles his sword so skillfully no doubt				835.238572488616
the first movement of d artagnan was to return it but milady added no no				1379.1981845722828
i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party				2574.500260897267
the good abbess had naturally consented to her request and as a commencement they were to sup together				660.0029096833081
milady passed her two arms round felton s neck and let herself slip out of the window				58.61952370129519
stop he said there he is at his post gondy looked at the spot indicated and perceived a beggar seated in a chair and leaning against one of the moldings a little basin was near him and he held a holy water brush in his hand				704.8865051143046
about a hundred paces from the palais royal a patrol stopped the carriage				304.4255945467662

as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raoul s departure				1317.7380553865191
we are lost said d artagnan in the ear of athos				67.94412165424411

it is six o clock said madame de villefort evidently agitated				507.72982946028793
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean it means that i have just returned from yanina from yanina yes impossible here is my passport examine the visa geneva milan venice trieste delvino yanina				6440.404589235814
one may forsake a mistress but a wife good heavens				17858.154046832802
yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief then do not marry her said the count				10.896174456414084
i gave the custom house officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom i gave them then you have nothing more to do here no everything is all right now then you can come and dine with me i really must ask you to excuse me m morrel				85.77375596530878

on his return home albert expressed his wish to franz debray and morrel to see them at the opera that evening				67.57478438647443
a keeper replied grimaud				60.88662677608954
athos walked about in a contemplative mood				2622.295061651233
my sister is happily married her husband is only my brother in law that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless life				302.36420020733556
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd				1281.6600691071571
then you must not pay us we can scud like the pharaon under bare poles enough enough cried morrel almost overpowered leave me i pray you we shall meet again in a happier time				104.65992713939552
franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle				11857.776926660925
now i can not be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who can not speak and as the object of his desire or his repugnance can not be clearly proved to me on account of his want of speech my services here would be quite useless and can not be legally exercised the notary then prepared to retire				1643.801845534071
she had fled with him from her convent with your brother yes my brother was her first lover and she caused his death				639.2549173909151
dream of vengeance that evening milady gave orders that when m d artagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted but he did not come				446.47916932093835

but after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter yes where is this letter cried d artagnan				1.0168440348194379
mademoiselle said franz turning towards valentine unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man who made me an orphan at two years of age valentine remained dumb and motionless				847.0407545229991
joy shone in raoul s eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle				2190.2240193003877
he then formed a resolution				5206.191326644995
if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be lost				152.00572002102166
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway				35008.04355352048
there was a moment s silence				821.2917225255063
he had not seen morrel				188.85998067717716
as you say mazarin is a knave				2643987.8417976685
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos said she simpering				3918401.3331961785

help cried d artagnan stop my horse has the staggers in an instant the horse s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam				9368.740727912553
the old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head				17.02546426308453
do you wish to go to m danglars				48.59071135735783
it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen				29091.382884895163
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republic s which deputed david12 to devise a uniform for the academicians indeed said monte cristo so this gentleman is an academician within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly and what is his especial talent his talent				4088.288611714555
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture				1199.7655241421587
now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me i wish to speak with this gentleman 20045m and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson french who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have mentioned				2406.0847278444317
the cardinal knocked three times and in a peculiar manner				244.30230423712885
with what view with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of buckingham d artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation				397495.3893507334
or dreamed he was and awoke mad after all said the inspector if he had been rich he would not have been here so the matter ended for the abbé faria				32555.27256964092
a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living				6099.362410255393
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness				2180893.823095418
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation				597792.3236469794
what has just happened yes said the count you are right it is miraculous for albert is brave resumed morrel				34.18336070241668
he will explain to you the steps that i expect you to pursue				3098528.3647564524
god will help you gentlemen in the name of heaven said the wounded man collecting all his forces as if to get up let us not lose time in useless words				1021.5254751461765
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo				1.0092498062075697
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold				291.8964835301846
monte cristo advanced a few steps which were heard on the gravel				1047484.6083157307
madame said debray it is nearly six months since we have been associated				436020.7106016762
nay that he can almost work a miracle				1359852.3120231503
june and july were the terrible months with athos				450.51747297306963
a waiter opened the door				6.518876054347329
time however passed away the hours one after another seemed to awaken the clock as they passed and every blow of the brass hammer resounded upon the heart of the prisoner				367.459939147629
all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces no you did not answered caderousse you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner hold your tongue you fool what should you know about it why you were drunk where is fernand inquired caderousse				32.087743978449446

but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but i have always given it up				1256.197061288822
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m d épinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed				4860.211537230727
your majesty s mind may be quite at ease replied the officer i have my answer ready the blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by the rue richelieu				564.6927491570555

did you say he was coming yes summoned by m de villefort who is apparently as anxious to get mademoiselle valentine married as m danglars is to see mademoiselle eugénie settled				47399.409569670956
the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbé s dead body				781.7487174424114
five thousand francs per month				1218.4411882454483

in what in a pate for example in a pate said la ramee				11.374191590114238
at the sixth cabaret then as we said d artagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him				33.42208883807667
be easy kitty there is something between that man and me that he is quite ignorant of he nearly made me lose my credit with his eminence				339.42673126200737
the hostess as she entered saw d artagnan and uttered a little cry whereupon d artagnan judging that he had been recognized rose ran to her and embraced her tenderly				930.044779213591

both raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed				5234.608885527944
nothing could turn him from his purpose				827.56507079629
locusta valentine was alone two other clocks slower than that of saint philippe du roule struck the hour of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was silent				1037.0551968678692

i suspect said he a tall dark man of lofty carriage who has the air of a great lord				4748.734271368966
has your uneasiness anything to do with what m de blacas has told me and m de villefort has just confirmed m de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect				889999.7997636487
the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great				2300.55629153206
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention				3954.3850273991484
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows they ascended five or six more steps and then dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro				400470.88533122506

i know that it is terrible said d artagnan but when i reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scene again before me as if i now were there				460.0072615045664
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose				339425.6308647993

the repast was magnificent monte cristo had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian ideas and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his guests				2527.427138047983

he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned				181489.2257386451
well inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor 20147m why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franz s countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him				3565.0492357255093
the baron d épinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him				16.583259402935855

it happened that on this particular night the minister s box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question				913.178823039562
and now your excellency added he allow me to repeat my apologies and i hope you will not entertain any resentment at what has occurred no my dear vampa replied the count besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a way that one almost feels obliged to you for having committed them 20214m gentlemen added the chief turning towards the young men perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second visit wherever i may be you shall be welcome franz and albert bowed				1216.4325924521534

at length providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor				769205.8803112309
pistache went again around the circle but stopped at no one and at last went to the door and began to scratch and bark				679889.5195152991

then after seeing her eyes closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the apartment on tiptoe closing the door after him with the utmost precaution				2773.3272164861646

the poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body				1630.1870514775687
nothing nothing replied the priest go on it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and fernand who put it in the post but exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there yourself i said caderousse astonished who told you i was there the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness true true said caderousse in a choking voice i was there and did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abbé if not you were an accomplice sir replied caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception				828382.0090440861

lord de winter arrived at the appointed time but athos being warned of his coming went into the other chamber				107.85246175482523

once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post horses				713.5050224128813
and this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young d artagnan for so was the don quixote of this second rosinante named from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous appearance that such a steed gave him good horseman as he was				1475.8564324656693
at the corner of the street they met the count s steward who was awaiting his master				435.5686970778198

monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort				4.515209801625636
this noise redoubled when d artagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church				337.72848031576757
from this moment i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the door and left the room well well said monte cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things m bertuccio and to a king s attorney at that				277.7196596673492
my lord said d artagnan your eminence sees that we wish to act with all formality and due respect but i must warn you that we have no time to lose open the door then my lord and be so good as to remember once for all that on the slightest attempt to escape or the faintest cry for help our position being very critical indeed you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities be assured answered mazarin that i shall attempt nothing i give you my word of honor d artagnan made a sign to porthos to redouble his watchfulness then turning to mazarin now my lord let us enter if you please chapter lxxxvi				184362.38522091525
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal that the baron de chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward mme				212.71848309941078
there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease				4867.248010295052
if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through for i never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos				68.7190356893243
this was not enough he must now learn to write				59482.293102734504
he had retired at one o clock under the pretense of being indisposed				18684.457572640626

the appointed hour was about to strike				9226.289483971968
we must explain this visit which although expected by monte cristo is unexpected to our readers				24875.158816622177
at the end of the piece étienne entered and announced to eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits				94044.27112538135
this time franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat				944.6277905559209
d artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent				18900.99045105147
he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head				1662.5584000792753
and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude				1630.395390237275
at this moment a horse neighed				2315376.1188165476
disguised it was very boldly written if disguised stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation				5243.99747351773
in five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intact a piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of favor				6697.529583833187
morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he looked around on the assembly				6064.86777990301
blaisois replied mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask grimaud yes but beer asked blaisois sharply is that their true drink as to that answered mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty i must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the english what				1115.4408274884383
olivain obeyed and continued on his way whilst raoul remained sitting with his elbow leaning on the table from time to time gently shaking the flowers from his head which fell upon him like snow and gazing vaguely on the charming landscape spread out before him dotted over with green fields and groups of trees				515.4507946629758
he was as this remark shows a man full of philanthropy and in every way fit for his office				832.6593656872016
a name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way				349.9525670834286
the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her				176.1709633926084
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night				610.054023200165
the clerks gone mme				119.07450545590426

fortunately the reader may remember or may not remember fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him				5.177056050214564
his musketeers proceeded and followed him				2.1225903531498487

now if you please remove your bandage the general tore the handkerchief from his eyes				32.10075980222312

it was agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to danglars to invest some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of his future father in law who had of late sustained repeated losses but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to listen or to express a single doubt to the baron				1351.8128368590374
the duke however overcame all difficulties with a word his majesty s order and in spite of the protestations which the master of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles villefort was introduced				3495.0881775307034
he believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was completed				11456.893212893465

breathing that sea breeze so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy all the power of that army which she was to combat alone she a woman with a few bags of gold milady compared herself mentally to judith the terrible jewess when she penetrated the camp of the assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots horses men and arms which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke				177491.9282636249
oh don t let that disturb you cried mme				45.344768657834244

mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle				1723416.8384648317
d artagnan was over him at a bound and said to the englishman pointing his sword to his throat i could kill you my lord you are completely in my hands but i spare your life for the sake of your sister d artagnan was at the height of joy he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face				16600.70227604876
no i feel that i have reached the goal and i will go no farther				17914.085652357262
milady had likewise the best of passports her beauty her noble appearance and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles				2544.516130892529
everything said olivain to athos has been done according to your directions the horses are waiting and i was asleep cried raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details				13306.132028834798
then he added with a certain uneasiness did you meet them why yes i think so in the street said athos and he looked smilingly at aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise				483.30312043087713
under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance really captain said d artagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french				1919.1470394516446
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place				1344.6215974849456
the prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert				3844.2268179047887
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted				1667.6708882398452
the demon had known how to wound him				90.54569194165862
morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake				2505.162627314003

his best known work is the three graces now in the louvre				338.2879181589609
athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions				1254.482093880443

now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile				229.30781458689572

the evening of the betrothal villefort had as we have said hastened back to madame de saint méran s in the place du grand cours and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon				375.69896026660615

it is god s pleasure that things should be so the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce				1448132.4135650517
i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself				155.63187731022325

i require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our holy father the pope that is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit france and be an exile i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to d artagnan				1.0435606254150882

oh monsieur you can write as much as you like you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade				1869884.4145393672
as villefort drew near she advanced and stood before him				3.0570793898755526
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate				1824702.1708867652
d avrigny cried villefort i can not tell you all i feel at this moment terror grief madness yes said m d avrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act				1247.3666170805575

after the king and the cardinal m de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens				7287.050452193314
well asked he of the count what has then happened nothing replied the count only as you see the carnival has commenced				962.5481429468524
he then seemed more easy				668.0309132378576

vampa took this wild road which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks				4716.86872005597
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king				59.27336190355109
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance				3131.4981624992174

saved mechanically repeated the young gentleman releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into raoul s arms raoul was but ten yards from the shore there he bore the fainting man and laying him down upon the grass unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet				11151.371989320518
monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenances nothing was omitted go on go on said d artagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come				892.3590211825252
these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him				13.137204914166992

thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with ice				18442.1552810697
no monsieur it is not aramis and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon you you pardon me cried d artagnan				1.021979570634178
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say on but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well i think i may venture to ask you this favor you may venture to ask me anything well then my dear count present me to your princess i will do so but on two conditions i accept them at once the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview very well said albert extending his hand i swear i will not the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers i give you my oath that i will not enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not				51.7058509215025

four men surrounded him besides the postilion				374719.0870037419
aramis whom we have sent for that s true said athos we must wait for aramis at that moment aramis entered				114.10289182449988
but the child the child sir repeated the agitated mother				3197.847943952845
if the king had desired that the letter should be given to him madame he would have demanded it of you himself				310.05631447636915
come come said albert do not assume so much indifference				31558.798267736453
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time d artagnan was better informed than she was				143.92065245785278
as little sensitive as was the heart of d artagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance				1028.467745519161
queen destined as you are to endure every sorrow on this earth hear the result of our unhappy mission athos kneeling down before the queen trembling and very cold drew from his bosom inclosed in the same case the order set in diamonds which the queen had given to lord de winter and the wedding ring which charles i before his death had placed in the hands of aramis				39.91784105022169
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dantès				170.09122250273566
my father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from heaven well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you i must again excuse myself m morrel for after this first visit has been paid i have another which i am most anxious to pay true dantès i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father the lovely mercédès dantès blushed				629.4372247409167
ah said monte cristo i did not expect that the affair would be so promptly concluded oh things take their course without our assistance				2747.4851892180627
what is going on asked franz of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it				11.482925869827998
my misgivings had been but too true				1559.9936338161062
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length				354.8585858346638
to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which i should arrive lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady thinking that as his sister in law employed them they must be the best				8133.185008135063
milady was wrong in fearing that mme				1156.5050015552667
i was sensible that i could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance				1303670.3606620568
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles				2147.849986039416
keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first efforts for she deserves not even the shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her and providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty				3196.478919333863
she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes				28.27492055004729
now as these street arabs of rome more fortunate than those of paris understand every language more especially the french they heard the traveller order an apartment a dinner and finally inquire the way to the house of thomson french				2779.89686070269
wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not porthos all gascon as he was d artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood				3263.337096347628
count she said you are i fear gained over to the court				269.286685626772
such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful chapter liv				8085.884883852398
thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman				341.7901814886325
now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion m de tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly				36143.09375309128
call for me at eight o clock or shall i wait supper for you at seven that will do very well said aramis				7.26420017168266
a man of the count s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones				19200.13915769328
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect				3664.2359555535804
d artagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features				2627.9504934567462
athos began to despair				1121.6352605299724
how long will this fuse burn asked this person				1379.7053282090806
will you tell me that your three damned musketeers athos porthos and aramis and your youngster from béarn have not fallen like so many furies upon poor bernajoux and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably by this time he is dead				1741.759786635714
i don t like mazarin any better than you do				180.66462262688944
he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion				5863.898524904422
have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die take courage said grimaud they are gone to find assistance who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud				828.7663569500239
bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen and what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked d artagnan				1.0172698503157882
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemen s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him the servant bowed and retired				239.13833647374528
we started a stag of ten branches				59802.2383811633
50211m madame said the count it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness but i offer you consolation will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend i am indeed most wretched replied mercédès				372.1912535275711
dantès concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed leaving the rest on the floor				472.58558396965043
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another				183.4423105647632
de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death yes said villefort really count you frighten the ladies what is the matter asked debray in a whisper of madame danglars				22.023722559978587
on the day after the morrow by eleven o clock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was				1293.1987468794405
he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante				2763926.459744352
we are not generally very severe with the austrians				1689680.0402047872
one said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death				906.4665234296663
well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention				1339.7102844575138
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you can all three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools				1031636.3607518029
but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness				7803.889546670772
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading haydée aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing room				3.566239480939374
do as you think best d artagnan at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going farther				16282.099890254978
no be assured i am not mad				939.2742995903302
maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little with me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor				371.9983886034059
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless				3109555.2656218414
oh why is not the world a wilderness she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle d armilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow				1534.404938300492
m coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities				870075.557688771
he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers light complexion and light hair turning rather gray				3978.636221780869
there is no doubt of that				49.79414826370935
one single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was selim s flaming lance				67158.51124129366
the commissary was seated in the chair and was writing at the table				155.81417214724544
you hear comminges said the queen				8.938364926215892
you should furnish him with some of course replied monte cristo				1.010931968253841
in five minutes bazin made his appearance looking in every direction to see if he were observed but he saw no one				994.5879106411494
in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where d artagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where athos was to be				780.0678575672841
the queen saving us her friends nothing more moral				480995.138523274
but instead of obeying him the servants stood watching m d avrigny who ran to valentine and raised her in his arms				47.954109572217604
my place of abode is no				829.2992397232711
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away				119.06667019116726
the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count of monte cristo reappeared				1790.320574721634
he s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head				698.0776248786635
women say those things but never do them you do not know mercédès what she threatens she will do idiot muttered danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself that s what i call love said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever				1687.9613842216584
the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair do you really think so				37.441308527401375
all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of aramis				185.86983830317212
in a quarter of an hour we set off that s the advice i was about to give monsieur and where are we going may i ask without being too curious pardieu in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone				2877.1342288728233
with what my father said just now he returned a sign in the negative				85081.59728791063
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers				1541.9294409258173
yes he appears to be a resolute fellow well he will do more than he has promised he will do wonders then the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs				428.7074721164992
the fêtes are veritable pleasure days to the italians				627120.5834727768
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father				176.0784983141517
whilst they pursue him the king might escape it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him what do you think of this counsel winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him				5.920159239234684
many small donations 1 to 5 000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs				24865.00753006745
thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a churchman				3380.404114005704
well within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions i promise you will produce ten or twelve but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie i saw you arranging a deposit is not that the term of five millions and a half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken				509663.60807712335
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly jacopo expressed great regrets that dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each				1236.3671632121607
but sit down said monte cristo really i do not know what i have been thinking of i have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour don t mention it the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself				34.650384711313315
and he is dead yes well sir said d arminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not exempted				587585.0516357442
the count cried a young voice that made athos start				4002.001708345802

what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor				5898.740682770027
franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them				47.15145862565967
beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream				6866.041076141794
i do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept secret mordaunt followed bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out				1974.1166666339252

great people only thank you for doing the impossible what s possible they say they can effect themselves and they are right				654.6388126655905
athos in his hours of gloom and these hours were frequent was extinguished as to the whole of the luminous portion of him and his brilliant side disappeared as into profound darkness				1210.8007183225602
he resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was finished				6293.775200267999
they drew near to the sloop				3677.974014740884
i will consent to share this dreadful secret with you but i will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as crime and misery will in your house then you abandon me doctor yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the foot of the scaffold				3230.834798431325

he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric in ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous				520296.0440389443
d artagnan and porthos withdrew to a corner of the cabinet				22248.243678784962
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber				99.09943057676139
a rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of honor				200.62880339085572
monsieur d artagnan cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy monsieur d artagnan				845.1139205988399
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister				1564.9936939118618
my death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger laporte burst into tears				304.591123569354
my intention was to inform monsieur laporte through my husband in order that monsieur laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself there but i said d artagnan can go and inform monsieur laporte no doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre and would be allowed to pass whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against you ah bah said d artagnan you have at some wicket of the louvre a concierge who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would mme				249.70301081538426
what replied the englishman				94.19833693941135
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of albert s eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat				1703.6704890524697
besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the luxembourg				597.8190615626368
then steer for monte cristo the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island				4071.681944076543
true he replied and my protector is very kind that dear protector said caderousse and how much does he give you monthly five thousand francs as many thousands as you give me hundreds				1948292.365086948
you can not condemn me i offered you tyburn said lord de winter				2.1677255442407843
now chevalier he added turning to aramis let us go				354.66878326214226
can t you guess my dear athos				61.602312207444854
now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring				1616135.6219664086
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one				1802.3036418527151
oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedy weapons i own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly jealousy indicates affection true but i am not jealous he is of whom of debray no of you of me				27.967876811733504
after this second part of his discourse fixing his hawk s eye upon poor bonacieux he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation				2633.46240671479
there is no harm in over precaution				4598.234988384604
i will descend with my eyes shut have you confidence in me said felton				110.64970495519523
sir said d artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers well that is scarcely the question				385.29859026784857
i see you now				132.5024913722688
the devil exclaimed porthos there s vulcan foundered zounds cried d artagnan then we must stop				1556.8502648039191
there only they explained to them the matter in hand				862.9768774398971
d artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him				197.0320100906555
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them				37.38149388281717
obey laporte do you not see i have no time to lose laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing				22545.604477241308
mercédès might have been a queen sir if the crown were to be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent				1289453.2526229853
d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen				10334.84625720263
on the contrary he added laughing if they want to see their stuart they shall see him				11.052604393573569
while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years				579.2705712102836
you must make some reformation in that quarter you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely i will show the gentlemen the door monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh				813.4569385002313
it is no doubt the same said he				11.481198484016199
from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice				48864.96087964692
oh you can not believe what you say let me act as i please felton let me act as i please said milady elated				7563988.203266178
by the way what said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated				3265.0928271616513
it appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his journey				2695.882315886799
i will bless you i i am dying cried mordaunt come to me				18.03825316066553
goeden day broder replied the astonished landlady				18512474.929326672
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except monte cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence				414.77815721557073
the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor andrea cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune				1025.9109801032416
you do not know that i remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the château d if				1.4708274408513056
i tried to pray but my tongue was frozen				34130.129259491536
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh				1113.39760854534
why are the glass and decanter empty asked he valentine said she only drank half the glassful the translation of this new question occupied another five minutes				585098.9441745983
what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the eyes a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the place with their golden and silky reflections				42547.675745110115
no monsieur it is impossible i can go no farther what does this mean demanded the irresistible voice of monte cristo				1.016196490172845
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight				11210.818762738918
i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information sir replied the mayor				693406.2584191987
let each take seventy five that is enough to take us to london and back				1107.5195549125617
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared				67.35512919789042
porthos comprehended that this chest although it did not correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams must be the blessed coffer and he congratulated himself that the reality was several feet higher than the dream				1283.030984709605
moses the servant of god he was but a servant please to understand moses blessed with the hands he held out both his arms while the hebrews beat their enemies and then he blessed them with his two hands				1432.1778847130638
it is done cried she wiping away her tears and resuming her firmness i am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of shame				876.5061808738544
you must have had enough for today				712.7698334601271
you must stop at the little village of eccuis in which there is but one tavern the shield of france				475.2415151419081
he found the wharf too completely deserted the night too dark the captain too accommodating				567924.8685547858
although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfather s fortune i do not think that m d épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss				17823.019921870877
athos went to pay a visit to madame de vendome left his name at madame de chevreuse s and wrote the following letter to d artagnan dear friend i am about to set off with aramis on important business				1851.087486479639
27 replied the count				625.1124400453558
madame bonacieux murmured d artagnan				1.0146548748265767
the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate valentine will not die a superhuman joy expanded the old man s eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude				624.9005433343235
gradually the reception room filled and some of our old friends made their appearance we mean debray château renaud and beauchamp accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar in literature or the army for m de villefort moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social position than to his personal merit				76400.01522528878
in fact i am dead				333.69324702745877
the first who advances is a dead man cried raoul for it was in fact he who feeling himself pressed and almost crushed by a gigantic citizen pricked him with the point of his sword and sent him howling back				352.67608914607644
a fortnight after i was at rogliano and i said to assunta console thyself sister israel is dead but he is avenged she demanded what i meant and when i had told her all giovanni said she you should have brought this child with you we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it benedetto and then in consequence of this good action god would have blessed us in reply i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich what letters were marked on the linen said monte cristo				402.7165004205677
the duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace				1163669.2289724387
i will now go up into my apartment				304.6155249281713
but i require three weeks preparation at the end of that time i shall come and say to you the assertion is false and i retract it or the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the pistols from the case whichever you please three weeks cried albert they will pass as slowly as three centuries when i am all the time suffering dishonor had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my friend but you have constituted yourself my enemy therefore i say what does that signify to me sir well let it be three weeks then said morcerf but remember at the expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in m				226.52631048150553
let us see said athos				6.399193492315016
it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the pope s butler				2838974.564085044
d artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale				18901.314910840985
on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth				10438.844995665322
all day dantès walked up and down his cell				1437.21708588308
at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat				522.2511853834311
is this carriage for me said dantès				79.64119853343121
well asked he what now				495.29212659096703
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth d artagnan s confidence stopped there				635.5935750757932
ah said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero				343237.7473552286
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos				12.201370606848917
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold do you know where i am leading you said the countess without replying to the question				8403.701124608824
i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de tréville on some pretext or other which you must invent i am not very clever at pretexts				78958.60754431636
bonacieux had made with him for that very evening but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero that the bad opinion entertained by m de tréville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess				6220.047115974918
after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to cardinal de retz more ruinous than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president molé whilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes				14314.276028229111
the man was m de villefort i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone 20291m and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman no excellency returned bertuccio you will see that i had no time to learn it go on that evening continued bertuccio i could have killed the procureur but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden				2534.534365303016
ah the traitor and he disappeared				43.64729914465363
we must then as it appears to me travel in company				4865.827836083619
my wife and my daughter would die of it				34.330939774021
when i tell you a thing sir said mordaunt you insult me by doubting it i cried d artagnan i doubt what you say				62.55045140050975
were i in her majesty s place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate i should release broussel and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen				3648.6349239263486
at their approach planchet came out leading the two horses				731.1264100580264
reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office my father died because he could not do what i have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what i should do my father my father cried the young man why should you not live if i live all would be changed if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility if i live i am only a man who has broken his word failed in his engagements in fact only a bankrupt				3513758.9925633343
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port				2177.4198935853005
thin and lanky the executioner said d artagnan and aramis at the same time				30.971171845665708
he came to request his master to return to his lodgings where his presence was urgent as he piteously said				233.8824703187341
porthos had his fits				5201211.820428041
oh you love her still said kitty who had not taken her eyes off the young man s countenance for an instant				284.26302660434783
nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind				144.98146290033077
one might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet				36596.2799597342
during this time he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his side				80.72462433744508
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart oh				619.2938066206697
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness				495207.3949962709
i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman				278.306931568298
i am profoundly ignorant of all these stock jobbing intrigues because said albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them ah said the count i see that m danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300 000 francs in a day he must be enormously rich it is not he who plays exclaimed lucien it is madame danglars she is indeed daring but you who are a reasonable being lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountain head surely you ought to prevent it said morcerf with a smile				22598.580985107492
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly				1354177.4714503933
he is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the world and i will venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service				1759.313822062644
but it has none in fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank				1398618.1263436675
it was quite dark and no one saw them go out				17.857807462156448
isn t mousqueton there but he wears my livery my livery will be known replied porthos				17.38123652886997
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in d artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected				1172.8898421992387
the coachman stooped down for his orders				1221.1178769912003
there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose				581.3655950500226
are you a doctor yes the best you could have at the present time believe me but you say you have watched said valentine uneasily where have you been i have not seen you the count extended his hand towards the library				50352.24268321141
therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as i suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in horror it however proved otherwise				2554.3264853967294
while yet young unfortunately handsome i was dragged into a snare				3167839.0281718085
but before he fainted he collected all his strength to challenge you and to defy you while challenging you why this fellow must be the devil in person cried the stranger				139.13037640187687
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless				938.2836619581169
this time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire army				641.6733541397247
neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it				278.29857114743476
be calm for i am sure that d artagnan and porthos are at rueil alive and well but resumed athos i recur to my first proposal				35870.445528345124
now let us go 50205m these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement				1068906.6219256092
how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which i had counted a little i must confess for the time i have to pass here no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued well said milady what can those who sleep wish for a happy awakening				1049498.4454491057
athos was pale and trembled in every limb				914384.5617763597
the presentation when albert found himself alone with monte cristo my dear count said he allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelor s apartment				365.0914663344373
he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter				104.21019741550514
i have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer				3603.9060840185616
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest				898.1570521087423
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle then i am also a puzzle to your mother				385.86543002156515
he had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by enchantment				2323.9958208250832
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover				15615.24560456503
when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan these words produced a contrary effect to that which mordaunt had anticipated				838752.8168757854
did i tell you that i wouldn t serve any other				863.077289144955
after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night				230.32585949963104
eventually she was obliged to leave france				364.20972658754675
a daughter of henry iv of that great that sublime sovereign all which does not prevent you refusing hospitality to his son in law sir				362.4581611033948
well have you tied the knot inquired the grave digger who was looking on				50.7764919583027
bonacieux what is that noise that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness				1251.806882097019
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned				335.949006173135
hey said the cardinal opening the door				8.48932862914571
the queen has not only one son but two then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal no my lord but he will be answered the guard				8950.907411336255
the old servant left the room and presently returned bringing with him a small casket				8195.583017429844
but said grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins there athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven				65.7061223862529
athos my friend and the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other s arms then athos looking into his friend s face and taking him by both hands said what ails you my lord				16.295589825672614
the king don carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges and has returned to spain by the catalonian frontier				6337.037095416504
forgive me cried edmond blushing deeply				9781.290427031869
well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister s secretary				26210.487852458584
a burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill closed door and the door reopened				4136237.859487109
the youth s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day				185.33342953539366
dear lady said mme				41.09757258364053
i was blind athos has made me see that s all come here the two friends went near him				3.565442028343207
what is the matter then he asked				10.718274153477715
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last				1551.443387378558
albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances				155109.28677016517
why what has happened to you are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage asked monte cristo in the same tone that louis xiv				448.56210898043855
at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away				139.4157425208477
now for the tally ho athos threw himself into d artagnan s arms				7060.979214275702
you see i am more candid than you ah my father said franz interrupting himself				23.125698327673675
i neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me constance disappeared				3934.763315237389
why that is a fortune porthos made a most significant grimace mme				86.13969055957827
in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny				3520.220255118199
i know what is become of vasiliki and haydée				676.7829891053508
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services				223717.860049242
yes you are right i am but a poor friend to you				15.431422450512832

no indeed cried d artagnan				1.0177024598146636
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart				123.65428208056984

why when a man has friends they are not only to offer him a glass of wine but moreover to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water unnecessarily fernand gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his head into his hands his elbows leaning on the table				255.73073642758962
i am not a fighting man at all monsieur and i am afraid of the bastille hum said d artagnan				1.0267920489556719

eleven o clock had struck				2018.5873180590304
he had noticed however that the prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor no matter this was a greater reason for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor				11155.041591054587
how is that you asked me for five hundred men did you not				35.634709555319944

the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville				99.8676287207076
all this negotiation must be carried on openly i will follow your eminence s instructions to the letter				205.09963077722628
furthermore d artagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow				1276.0468245361883
supposing this person wearied at the inefficacy of the poison should as monte cristo intimated have recourse to steel what if the count should have no time to run to her rescue what if her last moments were approaching and she should never again see morrel				412.34017600590073

the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind				208.1783405259866
she had heard something said about supper				3813.968887428556
are you my friend				38.113234371819956
bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead				230.73390178437214
yes shall i give these papers to m de villefort no to mademoiselle valentine no to m franz d épinay yes franz astonished advanced a step				1009.9238345122108
then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel				1363.9817933022046
it is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it with these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary				2617.3406308414524
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight				1342.0350619741291
none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity				11648.949763182982
let my lord at two o clock ask leave to make up a game at tennis with la ramee and let him send two or three balls over the ramparts and then your highness will approach the walls and call out to a man who works in the moat to send them back again i understand said the duke				14.01362271005584

but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what i am to do for m cavalcanti give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40 000 francs payable at sight on you signed by busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsement of course i immediately counted him over the forty bank notes monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent				3028.5770259376395
then we shall pay the more that s all i see plainly enough				564.3662233507548
at first he had been followed through astonishment then with derisive shouts then the porters had insulted him then children had thrown stones at him and finally he was obliged to run to escape the missiles				164583111.7223823
it is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe				2736.062629480813
an instant after the boat rowed by two men advanced rapidly towards him				2.5755839211879006
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes watering pots hung against the wall this was all the furniture				1354.6869121169814
monsieur said d artagnan i beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat				763.9986461812493
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival				3091.3395490959065
what has she written to me said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me				35.23162116408237
la ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat				5208.614815884602
the night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege				2678.950441064637
i require honorable guaranties i am sir a living guaranty replied monte cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shed that is our mutual guaranty				1212866.6382643
you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here				375.5814580659055
soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god				3566.008135302893
i found myself again in complete darkness				699.8534075913041
debray was not yet come but albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera				1366.720760671283
50265m give way said the traveller				6851227251.891331
bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man				1.817003491827371
well then asked athos in a low tone				13.472335889269068
i was present during his last moments				4641.084039195905
my children he said this is the marechal de la meilleraie as to whose intentions you have been deceived and who pledges himself on returning to the louvre to demand of the queen in your name our broussel s release				1707972.7183821094
no said athos monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend				272.62469962736736
now you are exactly what i dreamt you were the man i always loved				1205.8306844170045
i am betrayed on all sides				1676.3676087657955
albert wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up				126.22711575445022
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat				694.9109200106079
and so being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and rich and that is happiness sir why do you call me unhappy danglars seeing his daughter smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal feelings but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation				11760.495716067155
m noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the king s attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed				539579.5239805762
hardly had d artagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication				14222.318155856778
then as they had been accustomed to do they had recourse to m de tréville who made some advances on their pay but these advances could not go far with three musketeers who were already much in arrears and a guardsman who as yet had no pay at all				97.38409214548146
madame de saint méran wished her daughter should be married there				565.8668929555167
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits				23274.70378894353
to morrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton how can you doubt it sir				179.26423548347265
toward six o clock m de tréville announced that it was time to go to the louvre but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past instead of claiming the entrée by the back stairs he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber				4273.007067358057
now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices with the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed doubtfully wistfully on danglars and then caution supplanted generosity				29283.864580689566
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed				1152.5681942984688
at what time you please sir replied franz				53.41938701306375
gondy continued his way and went as far as the tour de nesle				2586084.5099580367
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled				361.78094149020046
the company looked at each other in consternation				37574.84321837966
she had succeeded d artagnan was then in her power				1673.2258963422455
that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the point of signing five little bonds i have already signed two will you allow me to do the same to the others pray do so there was a moment s silence during which the noise of the banker s pen was alone heard while monte cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling				11531.02553882151
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring				8117.532142490413
danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by fear				808.1918134388847
what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort remarked a third i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father				167.90971720731625
the shortest follies are best my dear caderousse				100.07971764185871
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt				34801.26114933367
but beneath the ground floor stretching out into the island was a large subterranean cavern to which my mother myself and the women were conducted				15796.616344188693
but wait a minute anne of austria ran to her jewel case				2115.7438095282378
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est d artagnan whose erudition we are well acquainted with evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham				151568.0673497023
porthos and aramis did the same				141.3100404160559
i told you on the contrary take away the prisoner said the commissary to the two guards				3332.273694071467
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go				263.6829837373194
d artagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called mouston was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was				6088.361131188396
the young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw with a certain degree of inquietude that it was leveled in his direction but as soon as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless he threw himself upon the ground				81.221158743243
as to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the window opened it leaped out into the flowers of a small garden glided onward to the stable took out his mule went out by a back gate ran to a neighbouring thicket threw off his monkish garb took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier clothed himself in it went on foot to the first post secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to paris				1476.1048747194918
but on my soul it looks so				76.2849746386701
you perceive then that he is not happy said the count				9.398636116242574
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion				5755.121869028567
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued				2290.4129060439727

call an officer of justice he said and stay close to me he added in a low tone				14.871589363083082
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts				220.05352903149532
go and tell him the ring is his d artagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with you reflect athos ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make sacrifices				973143.821597349
can this be another vengeance of that woman it was now athos who turned pale				144.21783803807972
your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux let them be guarded more closely than ever and yet said athos with his habitual calmness if it be monsieur d artagnan who is concerned in this matter i do not perceive how i can take his place do as i bade you cried the commissary and preserve absolute secrecy				1774011.4408104517
count returned signor pastrini hurt at albert s repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions i do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed at my dear fellow said albert turning to franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and double barrelled guns				53315.82020319463

one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might				4333.952201019384
both got into albert s coupé and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud to the opera in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance				50281.271698230514
an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques unfortunately the general s valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker s lips turned alternately red and pale				583.8578329594862

ah maternal love is a great virtue a powerful motive so powerful that it excuses a multitude of things even if after duncan s death lady macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience madame de villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him				1294.003102286825

with every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained was not slackened				641063.5940385959
reunited oh it was in vain she told me you would not come				391.24263861496786

d artagnan turned mechanically looking behind him and between the figures of two soldiers he could see parry standing up and charles leaning on his elbow with his hands clasped and apparently offering a fervent prayer to god				2804.1724684586948
it had been supposed some of the papers might be in the arabian romaic or turkish language and the interpreter of the house was in attendance				2163131.7288286844

so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered edmond				697.388260188204
each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had happened				596.063095920028
and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own				183.74074548088566
it was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the rhône but the care according to the boy s account that they took to avoid being seen				4531.373289015985
i owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me i will give them				25.86843822925296
what could explain athos s having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table				270.38885997951655
you may madame said he with emphasis				1583770.7295365734
he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball				6008.529750669769

i am a straightforward simple man that s my great disadvantage				25115.198177628765
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he appeared				175.45828349751628
and yet their natural disposition revealed itself				2328.552634767079
there was a postscript i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent in his convent				1813.4215438343435
now go he made a sign to cocles who went first the seamen followed him and emmanuel brought up the rear				48131.05915285294
d artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet but not wishing to leave raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it				1883.3865608765907
the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud who turned away his head				13.355907030994631
you ll excuse me i know they exchanged bows and d artagnan returned to his companions				1390.1877115383807
but you come from england				437.2000760174561
i recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch				2067.7824756085834
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued				4784.801620277119
oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch shall i write your deposition				1238822.2266562856
everybody looked and listened with astonishment comprehending nothing of what passed				4187.547221646566
yes buckingham the woman was english then no she was french but she had married in england the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door				73.3043911697412
then he has not returned said the duke				13.207187569357568
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future				254.05128199462558
the daily renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer a service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy				2625351.839512192
d artagnan was worn out with fatigue				487.36414456834564
the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them				12.04162006878966
he opened the door quickly and milady saw him appear pale as usual but with his eye inflamed and almost wild				23662.113887649062
athos as a diplomatist				54849.417178043754
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwell s				190.15471310688503
the sight is hideous fools said charles do they take me for a coward like themselves				1565.2451994071187
dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions				151664.22130764072
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you pray don t mention such a thing said the count				9.482710886851631
that s well said athos filling his glass and that of his friend here s to porthos and aramis				9.643590769177433
my friend exclaimed monte cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness				1977826.3620098673
with two companions yes replied the duke				12.089576851875389
suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee				334.74347953404754
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed d artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her				91.16060429019953
make haste and dress yourself in fact said franz this horrible scene has passed away like a dream it is but a dream a nightmare that has disturbed you yes that i have suffered but the culprit that is a dream also only he has remained asleep while you have awakened and who knows which of you is the most fortunate but peppino what has become of him peppino is a lad of sense who unlike most men who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general attention was directed towards his companion				434.8367712652776
i know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myself it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice and i must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god if this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do it may perhaps come to this in time observed monte cristo you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection in the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs roman laws and frank usages the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it i agree with you entirely sir but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations				365430.7846583461

he had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and his jaws after the example of his clerks				46271.6956671025
lastly her hair which from being light in her youth had become chestnut and which she wore curled very plainly and with much powder admirably set off her face in which the most rigid critic could only have desired a little less rouge and the most fastidious sculptor a little more fineness in the nose				26102.203346538525
the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse				27.068387840144037
i would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the bastile he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived				18603.415351012387
the count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wall flowers				1222.9242623300545
it was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance				4480.9864705248265
twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next morning				119.79870246346927
besides d artagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her				39.09288664284527
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux the waiter had no suspicions andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all				656.1861233144532
why then have you laid it aside because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners sir replied d artagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks				8004.526324072034
did you see poor barrois die noirtier raised his eyes to heaven				93.62675413050155
this evening your destiny begins to change amen exclaimed d artagnan stopping the carriage				133.55942485362795
teresa said luigi yesterday evening you told me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the count s daughter yes replied teresa with astonishment but i was mad to utter such a wish and i replied very well you shall have it yes replied the young girl whose astonishment increased at every word uttered by luigi but of course your reply was only to please me i have promised no more than i have given you teresa said luigi proudly				445.33376030665005

it is well said the abbé we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve o clock instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour				1138.349223213721
the two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything				348.48552260575457
splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt and lace fell also over the top of his boots				7347.965596805126
on the doorsteps d avrigny met the cousin whom villefort had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied one of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to others				559.3687576415464
what o clock is it the baron drew out his watch				787.5806801985397

and why not because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the lady i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn said buckingham				2293.691712613737
that it seems is where he meditates on state affairs in that case said d artagnan i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an escort yes two soldiers and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers the soldiers are swiss who understand only german				46029.27519470455
he called for me at seven o clock and before anyone had arrived asked one of the door keepers to place me in a box				549.2345393912465

he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came re entered the hôtel and went to his apartment				186.61030330751717
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities				1271112.1142184983
to troyes in champagne i answered				6448.455700830926
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter				437.2230086754833
one moment longer and all would disappear				3669.48493759252
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin				3890.817574851032
then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity				809.0146241459812
i will profit by the advice and now added the queen her voice broken by her emotion have you any other question to ask me nothing the cardinal spoke in his most conciliatory manner except to beg of you to forgive my unworthy suspicions				86501.5848334716
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression				4377.6980130928705
i had but one thought and that was that he was observing me				25.11240554837579
it is the password				1381559.336792471
give him the despatch raoul				678.9437828380441
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villefort s face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also				1288.5821677706865
on the opposite side two cavaliers one covered with a gilt cuirass the other wearing simply a buff doublet from which fell the sleeves of a vest of blue velvet charged in front				4236.141052843468
how do you mean yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars				10.180495369193832

come in exclaimed d artagnan and another servant entered				44.31890785352578
still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain				3899.30919717863
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondy s coachman				5423.033403305739
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonder for whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that richelieu was great i will not contradict you there said d artagnan				175.58817968195808
nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos than i have but i like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves				461818.293381361
has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth if they knew anything they would not question people in this manner said d artagnan to himself				11.941973574471678

while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune d artagnan related how aramis being wounded was obliged to stop at crèvecœur how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner and how he d artagnan had been forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach england				1675.7034768774722
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice				15354.032980140251

i had determined to make believe sup but to eat nothing				229.2583971086004
it would be exceedingly droll the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation				954.2677296166097
i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m danglars in promoting a new railway line you m de villefort in condemning a culprit to death you m debray in pacifying a kingdom you m de château renaud in pleasing a woman and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride				2176538.7855460825

it is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities how so because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a corsican s nature to revenge himself what do you mean by having made a stiff having assassinated a man said franz continuing his investigation				30087.866124380136
d artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle				224.99637468213808

he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly				488.8229649704175
albert understood the allusion in a moment and was about to throw his glove at the count when morrel seized his hand while beauchamp and château renaud fearing the scene would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back				96.53165144270386
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations				428103.0501317129
ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes morrel yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied				1394.447346652559

at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lips a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young man s frame				2924.685549077676

the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london the devil				4298.904793560608
i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible yes said porthos				11.446077607306718

d artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour				614.9442893288077

he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie				3260.7550249584524
these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies can not hear us but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets yes said athos that s grimaud s business well then cried d artagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls heaven forfend said athos they may serve us these bodies serve us said porthos				479.0218699897516

milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone				396.8236191008878
these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain				11306.183724501954
you have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but i give you leave to try them upon this one				898.0208710931355
then we are once more reunited said andrea				135.2682631443468
comminges returned to his post				1492.6297454329745
a presentiment instantly told d artagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently				4407.251227686859
d artagnan ejaculated athos				15.133262011242413

twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot				734.1703267849215
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door				41.92389942048065
i say we have been here eighty three hours tis your fault answered porthos				16.696687432420934
he again ran back to the château				1021706.3037244373

then porthos and aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to grimaud grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle				188073.20665360393
albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position				330.190651488594
franz was deeply affected				25226.628525982454
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound silence				667.6382664361241

what says augustine on this subject severus sit clericorum verbo yes let the sermon be clear said the curate				6377.402531314416
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair				1119.988102393341
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground				1524.1005879087288
to what class of society does he belong he was a shepherd boy attached to the farm of the count of san felice situated between palestrina and the lake of gabri he was born at pampinara and entered the count s service when he was five years old his father was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at rome				1324.119865667862

on the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench a book a parasol and a work basket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman standing close to the iron gate endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter				851.3321262224538
peppino who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a light and lit a torch				13272.863183279213
hello here is my watch				1205.237446001196
he aspires to the hand of the proud eugénie what does that signify so long as they favor your suit but it is not the case my dear count on the contrary				11143.420012682524
now madame danglars feared eugénie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eugénie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers				31378.134541481668
if i had had a single ornament left i should have bought wood this winter to make a fire for my daughter and myself oh madame said mazarin your majesty knows not what you ask				7269.822258338776
that you inherit from your mother truly from my mother leonora corsinari how much may it amount to indeed sir said andrea i assure you i have never given the subject a thought but i suppose it must have been at least two millions danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up				168.04892888426863

oh oh said he here is a soup which is rather inviting what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup said porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago				465673.4737270711
they explained what had occurred that evening				523.0237454304598
the morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze				1441100.6788183697
this movement was observed by mordaunt				1621.922471518017
without this danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time for daylight did not reach his cell				1298.8558547452171
at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes				2014924.5337232451
when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him and for the first time in his life d artagnan who had till that day entertained a very good opinion of himself felt ridiculous				1972247.3145921757
and who knows it noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out				35.31464237477075

now i think no more i say only that fortune has turned against me i had thought to gain heaven and now i have lost it				16.07082367749774
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman				167.77014085836103
the proposition had been made and received with enthusiasm when fortunately eleven o clock struck				459.6456979049962
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids see our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun the count bowed but stepped back				316.9224093966712

here he is d artagnan walking and soliloquizing had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel d arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived aramis chatting gaily with three gentlemen but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m de tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see him				13.030859431054521
the two friends repaired to athos s and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them				22.828462831846732

at the bois de boulogne ennui and hunger attacked me at once two enemies who rarely accompany each other and who are yet leagued against me a sort of carlo republican alliance				3587.2993021663324
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged				581766.0896436196
i confess it openly				1225294.7883985126
now i repeat my father is named m de villefort and i am ready to prove it there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult				4861.212813081139
a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions				637300.111603038
he had assigned himself the task of saving a man s life that day chance caused that man to be myself				4319.201246577504
is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it quite so my steward transacts all this business for me it is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied said château renaud and it was quite melancholy to look at it with the blinds closed the doors locked and the weeds in the court				323.1924070239329
that day the minister s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill humor				593.9649532234625

sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law				495.0182408647632
then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart				1721.7467854192423
i reached the lower door				81.4899187854194
first and foremost dear d artagnan we have no title such as count here				338.1948561018744
and remember my life depends on your answer				370.838875221347
madame de villefort unconscious of the passions that exhausted their fire over her head at that moment held her son s ball and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss				5410.8726233165735
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear				4256.4253164786805
i tell you what my dear fellow said château renaud i can not imagine what objection you can possibly have to mademoiselle danglars that is setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank which by the way i don t think you care very much about				12106.60467951859
but i recollect perfectly one thing that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep i wished to try upon the arabs the new pistols that had been given to me				20.089464094504958
i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely				5294.040355406237
when you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern without a name and without a sign a mere fisherman s hut				1113315.958303345

but how do you know all this how do i know it yes how do you know it				12.666128328600871
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried				1715796.0288920528
with a man like you i fear nothing athos bowed				86.67436827623754
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do				884.032163786925

the result was that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators				812667.2752730644
it was then that he told me two cavaliers of the parisian army were seeking me and named the comte de la fere what				2507.753760851689
there are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty				2049.457592607438
that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding evening				21.89726810704653
are you still resolved to accompany me more determined than ever well then come along franz and the count went downstairs accompanied by peppino				6342.859629828965
a friend maximilian and who is this friend				626.6574901031141
it is true however that it was the shorter and easier part				5362.83401518635
well then only fulfil your promise of rescuing peppino and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render to another have a care how far you pledge yourself my good friend for i may remind you of your promise at some perhaps not very distant period when i in my turn may require your aid and influence let that day come sooner or later your excellency will find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble and if from the other end of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing you may regard it as done for done it shall be on the word and faith of hush interrupted the stranger i hear a noise tis some travellers who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight twere better we should not be seen together those guides are nothing but spies and might possibly recognize you and however i may be honored by your friendship my worthy friend if once the extent of our intimacy were known i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby well then if you obtain the reprieve the middle window at the café rospoli will be hung with white damask bearing a red cross and if you fail then all three windows will have yellow draperies and then and then my good fellow use your daggers in any way you please and i further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess we understand each other perfectly then				106.21434298413912
before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived				811.0811189744472
bazin was then at the height of joy				281.98619078486763
but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally				84146.28102836601
raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell				1612.330711503399

after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocéens and read the semaphore this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office				43365.09464915358
in which we hear tidings of aramis				48.7709239008722

you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count				9.188005153052247

15 rue de nouailles he has i believe two hundred thousand francs in morrel s hands and if there be any grounds for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you will most probably find him better informed than myself the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the street mentioned				1104744.7747608249
oh how happy you must be in not having either wife or children do you think so indeed i do and so mademoiselle danglars she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel and is she gone the other night she left with madame danglars no with a relation				3994023.806148472

then on the anniversary of the day on which i had been insulted i hung my cassock on a peg assumed the costume of a cavalier and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to which i knew my man was invited				9376.865916440902
himself who took a pride in being considered a past master therein				23060777.735203832
was there nothing to fear				564.3603029445138

each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them				13.877648731979654
the marquis of saint méran				413.04191623067544
well said the president your name i can not tell you my name since i do not know it but i know my father s and can tell it to you a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand				12.86821678527007
eh he said negligently this money is not mine				1771.8952096956584
they merit richly that piece of attention on your part the advice is good monsieur and tomorrow i will set out tomorrow				636.4378951568018
jesu cried planchet can it be at this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air and the two travelers could see displayed in all their brilliancy the large eyes the vermilion visage and the eloquent smile of mousqueton				1731.1992780528708
well said the prisoner when the door was shut i am not so far advanced as i believed				97962.972660513
what the devil are you doing by jove i am falling or rather bayard is falling answered porthos				18.34790466632307
the same as yesterday another nod on the part of grimaud				955.2725101285055
the deputy procureur du roi chapter 7				7590.2072942989
he remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed him				70.83316612974745
and here he comes by jupiter				10245.045710494087
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended				1116895.520199858
it is your new master my good fellow said the footman				225296.03262526944
i am haydée the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his beloved wife 40202m the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly				1490.9332072528093
he cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off teresa as nessus the centaur carried deianira				955130.0379384034
the night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven o clock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission				1715.9153191228493
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all the fact is said d artagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotedness why i should be a ruined man no for porthos will pay you hum said the host in a doubtful tone				220.0749357313294
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter				926.0461154597632
as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo				23597.573186909915
am i to be captured he cried no not if i can use more activity than my enemies				941.304944027195
an englishman you say yes replied maximilian an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french at rome				238.70769112821944
it could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness for in truth he only drank to combat this sadness which wine however as we have said rendered still darker				2123.8240689906393
i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight				2861.6022175858093
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors				1887946.358784188
the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hell that is the point 30075m really madame this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours but which would easily yield before sound reasoning				1549031.4916836151
trust me said aramis do not expect to find anything in abbeville				934844.5770611964
nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went there				815.9992321748452
they reached the rue st honoré and in the place du palais cardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades				2139.5507870781817
the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by milady s pulse that the case was not serious				7514.122779057719
but when aramis had presented that peace to her in a true light that is to say with all its advantages when he had pointed out to her in exchange for the precarious and contested royalty of paris the viceroyalty of font de l arche in other words of all normandy when he had rung in her ears the five hundred thousand francs promised by the cardinal when he had dazzled her eyes with the honor bestowed on her by the king in holding her child at the baptismal font madame de longueville contended no longer except as is the custom with pretty women to contend and defended herself only to surrender at last				4184.437396646903
as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission the young man s eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself				38.59929472668141
the pardon chapter 117				241529.93231895703
still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness				900253.8450670514
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend				3167.737519513971
the cart was returning empty to paris and the two lackeys had agreed for their transport to slake the wagoner s thirst along the route				27903.766327467423
but grimaud s ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses				1297.7421349249653
it is with valets as with wives they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain				2827.9237098193607
why then doesn t he attend to it himself as at chantilly ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where i could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges				21539168.060804047
all s well he cried as he entered i have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow				8722102.907285184
in truth madame do you think that can be possible indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or mad				2947.874338291238
there are only a dozen men at the most that would be nothing for us four it is too much for us two				1676.7313544605004
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own				81.59696351143056
well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the abbé				17.488247989083153
there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves i do not accuse them sire but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the convent des carmes yes you are right tréville you are right then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred for your majesty can not be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal yes tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty				23757.715334906858
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one				1116.4838067204216
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m bazin				771.372154701652
there said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire for as i told you i expect someone at nine				68575.44022594891
but devil take him				5.7919892914872175
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears				4833690.974186655
i rely on your friendship to assist me beauchamp if contempt has not banished it from your heart contempt my friend				45.95785106290729
pray learn monsieur olivain that people like us are not to be served by cowards				68481.0695895349
it is the talk of all paris and you count have made this match asked beauchamp				45.3779165910687
beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice				11023.262589804961
as long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward milady who standing on the deck followed him with her eyes				36.38687024766797
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no suspicion of it				10.086443293870115
i have proof of it				10.683703870778364
madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which at any other time would have indicated a storm but for the second time she controlled herself				209.6457930531245
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england she was young you say twenty five years old beautiful ravishingly blond yes abundance of hair falling over her shoulders yes eyes of an admirable expression when she chose				813485.332741828
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and d artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant				705.5099398578693
it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shop people and the bands of mendicants reappeared				12392.097180259976
there were moments when looking at grimaud the duke asked himself if he was not dreaming and if that marble figure was really at his service and would grow animated when the moment came for action				24892.909801647515
their eyes measured the height and they exchanged conjectures				205026.9985654456
one night twenty years ago my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you to armentieres i know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms just so where do you come from now i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse				192.96620463504044
but there is nothing which would do nothing 40114m oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help				2954.38267140344
the timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman				537.5765820188351
for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven				283.51335662737415
the corsican ogre chapter 12				187935.1496976083
come and roll me to bed				2096.243079732401
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him				11.998804435689188
felton let me die well then we will live and die together cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner				279.5471804925751
do you hear said the king				19.3441849190797
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard				907.9550715433899
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands				92.96860434315684
go away now mouston so he s called mouston thought d artagnan tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about				11550.021719629185
emmanuel hesitated a moment but his desire to make julie decide immediately made him reply				602.7121181641536
he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow				492585.72351608047
no no monsieur said monte cristo				1.0136263372503007
nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dantès the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmond s time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them				37.60718489815437
who has consoled me in my sorrow but he				450.2797261439727
faithful friend noble heart said the king i should not have been rescued				917120.7018950835
lord de winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside her				30.011676799789935
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper				1276.3559629795911
come with me my friend said the englishman i wish to speak to you chapter 30				6213.48989424831
to come in the capacity of a cousin and seat himself every day at a good table to smooth the yellow wrinkled brow of the old procurator to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them bassette passe dix and lansquenet in their utmost nicety and winning from them by way of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour their savings of a month all this was enormously delightful to porthos				2249.145370633002
nothing of all this escaped grimaud but la ramee looked on with the curiosity of a father who thinks that he may perhaps get a cheap idea concerning a new toy for his children				13390.288758154093
well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end				492.3684572550541
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de château renaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf				226.2726146686225
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way				488.4809101193506
those who were not killed felt the heat of the flames				20648.995304378222
it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer				913.9738425241336
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance				298.02600505577306
i can t see				209.79869818319884
the chocolate was inoffensive for m de villefort felt no effects				1438450.640824968
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor				630198.5977421623
monte cristo shuddered and arose				19082.215787924903
he wished bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of m de la trémouille returned to his hôtel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner				1151.5486114279129
i could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne flasks				554766.2578065095
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest				90391.30709903516
there is a man after my own heart				50.44480866199801
he has slain his uncle he murmured				452.391397808985
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known				288.8911452938447
then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited				36578.903422106414
i will show you the way and he went in first				364.91741865664403
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement				1392.3683498281416
the abbé busoni said la carconte				1170.1676470488983
i have already told you avenge him on whom on his murderers how should i know who they are order them to be sought for why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel				3478.1468387499535
luigi was not mistaken				165.98849013256753
the clerk continued to write for the next five minutes the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motionless				1156.0595040192297
was killed but what has this vision of henry iv				21.05487771360908
wait an instant and he pointed his gun at d artagnan who was riding toward him at full speed				464.77698736595823

look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of d artagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d artagnan				1.0801913731007002
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire				17463.56268001534

unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn you love valentine that daughter of an accursed race never had morrel witnessed such an expression never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face never had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous nights of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire				7106.132189352934

i was for twenty years cardinal spada s secretary i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year 1811 since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government why from the french government because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abbé faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cæsar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly it is the only means of rendering italy strong happy and independent very possibly only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon but it is not that which i wish to speak of but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance we are coming to the point whispered the governor				670.4466332298106

why the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each other my lord cried the queen you forget that i have never said that i love you but you have never told me that you did not love me and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an ingratitude				26295.562946911483
