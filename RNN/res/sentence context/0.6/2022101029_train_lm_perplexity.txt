he then repaired to d artagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own				257.95248027983524
if you had seen at what a pace he came like the wind i should think so a horse that cost 5 000 francs said monte cristo in the tone which a father would use towards a son				1364.78006417232

all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next a sublime spot a resting place full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking				999.0511635745545
the scotch army stood motionless and silent seized with shame at sight of these preparations				8040.408615587327

i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions well what next said d artagnan laughing in spite of himself				11.4968995917174

do you regret them asked morrel with his open laugh				1226.1509196312297
however the sight of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief				1318.8299453295053

as he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the darkness				770.2830768257654

say my highness is furious				6325.094380423807
it was just before this that grimaud had perceived the two men seated together				154.41124199689014
towards the evening of the third day				53.87966992051319
motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of terror				206.85900974977312

i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me				19.625682998844237
the marshal thought this barrier not so well fortified as the others and determined to break through it				17.05641524884367
villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught				6560.243980692732
the people had made no demonstration for the princes but they had risen for broussel they were taking the part of a plebeian and in defending broussel they instinctively felt they were defending themselves				487.6049635398505

for the king cried d artagnan				1.01593709048747
i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder				1326.0210804436206

the carriage rolled rapidly onward				4125.004649180823

you are placed on high my lord but tremble				2621.2599284144967
her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes so you are free now and rich alas groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year				314.6890494624373
well yes and i had good reason to be so replied château renaud				1.0311504595805936

monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me you have then seen something replied d artagnan				1.015523314568201
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the vessel certainly to return to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention				1232.4617081241433
are you going to drown me these cries had something so heartrending in them that m d artagnan who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of milady sat down on the stump of a tree and hung his head covering his ears with the palms of his hands and yet notwithstanding he could still hear her cry and threaten				3960.2762474768415
you are examining my den said aramis				4.745019433600275
if d artagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is				233.77810728415915
it was a terrible moment for the young man				1.9421816868790882
the four muskets made but one report but four men fell				1840.6933603444436
nevertheless monsieur de tréville s company of musketeers alone can not maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will				2093.3014220628115
hang it said porthos				9.951390857250255
how go then exclaimed d artagnan				1.0182886116330105
well what is it what is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out				21.466954021632354
i thank you madame said he for the deference you have shown to my wishes but i think you want two of the studs and i bring them back to you with these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given him				3.248733841414245
it was too warm in the room was it not count she asked				19.978159164882587
oh i see you prefer peregrination				5929.3323256010835
i am the chevalier de rochefort answered the other the equerry of monsieur le cardinal richelieu and i have orders to conduct you to his eminence we are returning to his eminence monsieur the chevalier said athos advancing and you will please to accept the word of monsieur d artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp we will be his guards monsieur upon our word as gentlemen but likewise upon our word as gentlemen added athos knitting his brow monsieur d artagnan shall not leave us the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward and saw that porthos and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate he understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men				525.2323180867036
that is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me				6.680861398298344
the sea knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea				171.88994212373575
then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly i would recommend you to travel to travel she murmured				521.9571652004762
about half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of greney				2814.194769915419
really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with man that is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really do not understand you perfectly i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king and that the men whom god has put above those office holders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fill i say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation				3514.4976245909475
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady				278.8187219724438
the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her again				210.32356226062433
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame				1167.2964653104636
in fact d artagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests				9762.484291277882
then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time				384.20844331269024
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m de nargonne had married m danglars				131.87255153516767
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will see you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly				1835.7759817495894
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else it is for that reason perhaps that they do not quit me they had long since passed to dessert and cigars				6180.530295869774
buckingham remained for a moment dazzled				5989.575621436058
was it not by chance the count of monte cristo bought that house				118.5461587594104
in the first place there is a little intrigante named bonacieux she is in the prison of nantes that is to say she was there replied milady but the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent to a convent said the duke				28.08522681398337
now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts				1343.3206611772703
are you there now certes replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle the fingers resumed the jesuit st				965.4919350670621
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal				3338.6896949177417
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz				47.44510527260533
you at marseilles yes says he				32.25894644669946
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the other well done planchet				171.3050642677805
0099m go on sir said he				30.072974725424228
no half confidence or you understand i know it from my wife monsieur from my wife herself who learns it from whom from monsieur laporte				1788.326609190445
the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles with directions from dantès to join him at the island of monte cristo				1.0888792301169465
edmond inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his strength the flag stone yielded and disclosed steps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto				1856.4999558148545
before we are alarmed we see correctly when we are alarmed we see double and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble				3332.852122766964
you were rich when i married you but little respected				1333.1776821496364
your excellency said peppino addressing the count if you will follow me the opening of the catacombs is close at hand go on then replied the count				7.221075709189186
athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness				1307.5569064357783
if these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill them				18.706372489440273
then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips				39.8361058634574
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he re entered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment				1534.6456737477301
he had now leisure to look to his wound				721.285572461418
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman s word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be so that s porthos all over murmured d artagnan				1.0129338504901846
i am dying with anxiety				1103.4758502020372
now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues				3075.536821836439
reflect then wretched man and repent no said caderousse no i will not repent				6447.736222961167
he means replied the man upon his return that he got in that way and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through				1415.8448796325313
d artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him				8.720069788303212
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her				20.842118362584884
ah my dear doctor said the procureur heaven declares itself against my house				399.4891841145161
but tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to england i come to see you replied milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which d artagnan s letter had given birth in the mind of her brother in law and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood				2577.6547132975943
the poor duke swore fell into a rage yelled and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the marechal ornano and the grand prior of vendome but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter				4260.039576818415
amongst us a simpleton possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity who has an enemy to destroy or some near relation to dispose of goes straight to the grocer s or druggist s gives a false name which leads more easily to his detection than his real one and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping purchases five or six grammes of arsenic if he is really a cunning fellow he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced then when he has acquired his specific he administers duly to his enemy or near kinsman a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst and which without rhyme or reason makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood				1232.3230226125925
the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine				455.06770275212773
but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she				55.33086755474627
20043m there s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it rose				2709.3673697514973
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet				6812.082883067087
i shall go and die by his side madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some hope no friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself				2384.2910476804136
at this moment planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont				8647.869291786637
where are we going asked he by a gesture				735.1620716341843
d avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier				420.65474743832556
en route gentlemen and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris				78.2391606675006
cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity				296.11890783743996
stop said the englishman i have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper				1394.455325767108
i might have suspected he was poisoning us and you see you would have been deceived yes doubtless but believe me that man has other projects				882.5239193209732
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice				2.3280886129267775
where am i said she				72.1207480207638
he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him				17.141091390433033
speak then chevalier said the cardinal				20.878907583029143
i staked on him but there were three races were there not yes there was the prize given by the jockey club a gold cup you know and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race what was it oh shut up again interposed some of the audience				3155.493005494166
morcerf and château renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission				4130.610343924662
she is not to leave this chamber understand john continued the baron				559.4229060074119
each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold				243.76760757528425
the four old friends prepare to meet again				180.7137334356643
sir he cried scarcely able to believe his good fortune sir i can not understand your generosity oh it is very simple my good fellow i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others then sir since you are so liberal i ought to offer you something 50227m what have you to offer to me my friend				191.05504289262316

mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini				4712.65114829832

monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me				14.17991294328268

i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance you have truly monsieur said d artagnan bowing again a courtesy for which i assure you i am very grateful you confuse me replied athos with his gentlemanly air let us talk of something else if you please				341.1393777743392

are you too proud to accept it young gentleman no sir said d artagnan and i will guard it so carefully that i will be sworn it shall arrive at its address and woe be to him who shall attempt to take it from me m de tréville smiled at this flourish and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window where they had talked together he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of recommendation				1151.8687819095153
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companion s half reproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind franz essayed to smile				505.27069652802226
he was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding franz smiled for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion				3968.3858047103254
i wish to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish satan bowed his head and groaned				1709.0560830459358
let us save ourselves at these words she passed her arm under that of d artagnan and urged him forward eagerly				1349.445382646739
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his weapon				4893.782805867982
take it said she and be accursed athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read dec				1381.0889162885562
you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die				683.2284218696346
ah said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of d artagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends				103.87576617903574
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old man s happiness was centred in his granddaughter				2086.4154601663445
the world is not wanting in attractions				4245.240584666791
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy ah said mazarin breathing more freely				2946.181009314974
athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly				4058.7370330613485
i am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me rochefort extended his hand to d artagnan who took it				13.255816226740604
to how much said she				73.66200379549939
it is best to constitute myself at once a prisoner with athos who is already arrested and with d artagnan who most probably will be gascon headed man will you have done said the king				13.970158955623692
a woman and consequently subject to the weaknesses of my sex i am alarmed at the idea of civil war a queen accustomed to be obeyed i am excited at the first opposition madame replied gondy bowing your majesty is mistaken in qualifying my sincere advice as opposition				2515.1906232805864
i don t comprehend you don t comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me which of my friends my lord your three friends the friends of former days of former days my lord				48.877062367248655
it was long since he had any reason for his morning s inspiration but he always slept all night long				988.8206646785038
oh where will be the end villefort rushed into the room				12.070024204313324
and he made the same friendly salute as d artagnan				1.0703800899204363
but it is your own fault				1676.752142312529
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale				470.99731355219205
as the night before d artagnan did not return home till five o clock in the morning				110.97879442503138
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm				1850.6576774131731
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left d artagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything				135.34942966144746
i must absolutely see it i shall find a way no nonsense caderousse i will offer myself as floor polisher the rooms are all carpeted well then i must be contented to imagine it that is the best plan believe me try at least to give me an idea of what it is how can i nothing is easier				1822.3542760436462
from that time he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the doctor had put him on a diet the abbé uttered a kind of groan				1013.0671024600589
there said caderousse and now although you have wronged us of perhaps 10 000 francs will you have your supper with us				4167.833653980113
i can not thus in a moment relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a father s untarnished name inspires a son				276.798835195246
and kill him said porthos				10.216771531347126
neffer neffer d artagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out				438.4587696038544
the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together				478.0324838603742
the army i will answer for it will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs the expression was imprudent but m de tréville launched it with knowledge of his cause				2296.6203685868336
the notary looked at villefort				18.473090003609716
if he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him i would have presented the letter to him with one hand and with the other i would have run my sword through his body i expected as much said athos and that was why i threw myself between you and him				164.88471683943362

and now once more adieu said morrel				25.60081135193714
what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed porthos				13.413856021812547
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it				18.19501840139707
but d artagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of athos				46.713947325316376

father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room				162.15280372451284
the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily				3290.5004252564004
i have then to inform you sir at the request of m de villefort that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed the feeling of m noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her				30.866561112718585
certainly neither i nor fernand said danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner				456.46358652555494
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender				33670.59900385645
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project				2023.0931645849762
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again				95.23721079932557
do you know that i am growing old				661.38784306489
some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging a sword for example richly embossed which belonged by its make to the times of francis i the hilt of which alone encrusted with precious stones might be worth two hundred pistoles and which nevertheless in his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for sale				2222.116461233249
besides his majesty takes no pains to conceal how little affection he has for me				9.512866532697835
d artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a single step				544.3025409749532
d artagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward ah yes said a light horseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly				950.7087652576653
i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down				368.9273379617277
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert				582.4857967850315
mousqueton had a magnificent livery and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his life that of standing behind a gilded carriage				266.98246942414573
then she ventured to ask what had become of felton				477.415610815199
but tell me valentine how has it all been effected				12998.999081783024
now after the oath i have just taken and which i will keep madame dare you ask for mercy for that wretch but sir are you sure he is as guilty as they say listen this is his description benedetto condemned at the age of sixteen for five years to the galleys for forgery he promised well as you see first a runaway then an assassin and who is this wretch who can tell a vagabond a corsican has no one owned him no one his parents are unknown but who was the man who brought him from lucca another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice the baroness clasped her hands				11.011753616816716
my lord i think we are in bad company a man advanced to the door with a kind of scythe in his hand				28.54019918006296
she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect				4768.861794613436
you wish to see blois again it is but natural then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed raoul joyously				4229.976616790726
one of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there				520.2694484845036

a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming				7084.310146668904
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid				2798.212520779225
well three days after that you talked politics with m debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain				1431.043328560863
the duc de beaufort				66.85091944953054
it can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts				866.1475300470868
they were anxious about you here i simply told them where you were				789.3846210227855
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so d artagnan declares just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door				5.6165577433516445
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word				198.69120017214482
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell oh				337.7624617793577
whether queens or not they are always the same do you disapprove of this journey my dear m d artagnan asked mazarin anxiously				1498.742563285459
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo				1.015432596585823
villefort took a chair but valentine remained standing by her father s side and franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his hand				18.812942054198448
don t lose a word of what i m going to say to you porthos				299.39652791921344
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you i am at your command my lord returned d artagnan				1.0824373974496069
aramis rushed to the hotel de ville where madame de longueville was sojourning				5923.143713577027
d artagnan took some water in the hollow of his hand and threw it upon his face				110.52504611878908
this belonged to one of his friends at the café de paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after andrea had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of mauléon 25 rue saint dominique that being the name and address on the card				2287.90232884576
at last as albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time at the beginning of the second act the door opened and monte cristo entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the box looked around the pit				14082.640327278743
hearing the name of morrel who had left him only two hours before the count raised his head arose and sprang to meet him				1.9507893974791521
and to complete the whole haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers				7841.833382315663
yes but first give me this letter you have it already for it was taken from me with some others which i see in that packet stop a moment said the deputy as dantès took his hat and gloves				256.80901881433425
juxon was waiting for him impatiently				1069.6993880115642
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it				118.2314944284734
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl s heart				68.69086116748687
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune				939.6465623580859
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand				14.220913042913946
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring				4988.795608463698
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger				740.56067622512
at eight o clock in the morning morrel entered their chamber				380.28567139779295
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar				12290.479290282534
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person				1002.8341330431801
and have those who have lost their lives lost nothing m				220.19512473210472
his eye wandered to a long stout sword on his flank and he instinctively slipped it around within reach of his right hand				19.91149108648317
such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of cardinal mazarin once that of cardinal richelieu				304.0212983295925
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir				9209.28814261841
for the last time will you come cried milady				34.051837861053635
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance				5316.29663629138
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel				817.3060929797539
oh said valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear m d avrigny				4.108351783287073
you too then are unhappy she said				15.967585186375931
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side				622.8701641433338
i will therefore proceed				2585.1373829318018
grimaud shook his head negatively				5003.03184896524
he examined him and found him sound and without blemish				43325.98934829835
that evening i had translated an episode of judith and had just communicated my verses to the lady who gave me all sorts of compliments and leaning on my shoulder was reading them a second time with me				72.35114898832046
this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night are you quite sure of that certain				2527.7537605392504
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawing rooms come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying				626.439991572369
good day monsieur dulaurier replied d artagnan				1.0129661557046483

long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day				194.01579389237227
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england				303.7301957632886
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone				40.47378605637279
answer that is the very truth cried the mercer but monsieur does not tell you silence with respect to me silence with respect to my friends silence about the queen above all or you will ruin everybody without saving yourself				206.36079799516236
that s exactly what my wife said monseigneur do you know who carried off your wife no monseigneur you have suspicions nevertheless yes monseigneur but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary and i no longer have them your wife has escaped				1833.9596206826454
during the darkness as before my supper was brought				4078.6774519416176
villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination				1272.2792962974108
i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me it appears to me that this is quite enough				463.6927448596355
alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villefort s departure				934.0883240721021
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference				1710.8670267727064
do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me yes monsieur said the englishman bowing				44.77393694207315
from whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife from monsieur laporte did he give you any details he knew none himself and you have learned nothing from any other quarter yes i have received what i fear i am committing a great imprudence you always come back to that but i must make you see this time that it is too late to retreat i do not retreat mordieu cried the citizen swearing in order to rouse his courage				560.4882661312663
one of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left				761.7396711457496
he was about to marry her when one of the caprices of fate which would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end one of those caprices deprived him of his mistress of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present and cast him into a dungeon ah said morrel one quits a dungeon in a week a month or a year he remained there fourteen years morrel said the count placing his hand on the young man s shoulder				100.28412738312163
what dreadful sufferings said julie remembering valentine but whom with a delicacy natural to women she did not name before her brother				281.2296514051673
all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended				4335.101377083206
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom house officers				2226.4098144983136
her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to forget				8287.865382122203
three compartments divided the coffer				13568.934292157923
rebuff buckingham and consent to mazarin just like the women replied d artagnan coolly				103.1639672266879
god preserve me from another such hour as i have just passed then you know that i did not leave him i heard your voice up to the last moment here is the order he gave me and the cross i took from his hand he desired they should be returned to the queen then here is a handkerchief to wrap them in replied athos drawing from his pocket the one he had steeped in the king s blood				1293.1814809286707
he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover porthos with ridicule				2268.7515420903337
at the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads				1130.0771885264462
porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience				1365.3964899613975
you have a good memory repeat what i have told you				6.702139735205801
well then said the host your young master was here a quarter of an hour ago he will dine at mazingarbe and sleep at cambrin how far is mazingarbe two miles and a half thank you grimaud was drinking his wine silently and had just placed his glass on the table to be filled a second time when a terrific scream resounded from the room occupied by the monk and the dying man				8.122462248936973
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart				47.92994598164932
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men madame said mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction he is very gracious thought the queen can he have guessed my errand give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants alas sir replied the queen i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions				12946.814360062675
not locked he cried that is well and he entered the little room in which edward slept for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night				56.00223376914329
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity				1817.0153627641394
the dominions of kings are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of manners or an alteration of language				1110.5666885716723
he was occupied with the preparations for raoul s departure and was seeking to gain time				696.2047558142657
peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him				5.08469783176343
tell vitray to come to me said he and tell him to get ready for a journey an instant after the man he asked for was before him booted and spurred				3333.325746281529
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant true said m d avrigny we will return the doctor went out first followed by m de villefort				3.8561654044729905
athos and aramis followed him				2.7785282922693453
look said he is it not strange and he pointed out to d artagnan the scratch he had remembered				2245.576859175451
no replied noirtier eagerly				9.221092127772913
yet one wants some one besides you for that my fine king s cockatoo				16887.987238319914
he wore his elegant uniform d artagnan was wrapped in a sort of gray cloak the swiss was six feet high d artagnan was hardly more than five the swiss considered himself on his own ground and regarded d artagnan as an intruder				11698.88170158119
you mean to say then my dear monsieur la ramee that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird i will continue answerable for him take care				2121.189598728476
he would not however yield immediately to the young man s request but made a few conscientious objections				10840.684311488109
art thou dumb cried the duke				11.621995378759657
the gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chained up dog went up to the cabin				6088.883721842816
i could kill an ox with a blow of my fist well then family affairs perhaps family				7671.377429269495
do not my mother and you agree asked albert astonished				43.34225755594533
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot				597.4215318255705
that reply led to several questions about the king s capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely				1673.700688180041
porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of d artagnan and his yellow horse				239.1456345079699
you may go the footman went out				8.203333421410086
i sold myself for more than i thought i was worth he added attempting to smile i fetched 2 000 francs then these 1 000 francs said mercédès shuddering				1150.4717787338436
he never spoke of women				888.7558633810257
this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned				4568.394348592953
i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew i only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want				351.6732121050857
from avignon to marseilles seven francs 7				13357.841320132948
do you not know that all paris knew it yesterday and the day before it had already transpired on the bourse and m danglars i do not know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a million and you another order for i see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole yes they sent me the order of charles iii returned debray carelessly				1279.3971726485404
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with d artagnan when he was on duty				1104.8589866790073
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon				381.3577777481687
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me bravo cried château renaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism				5304.370147528289
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man				21.569062049639896
i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you but i shall lodge here no longer				854.7375055149379
it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat				1677.628664682102
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our faults				31792.973328326712
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head				21.72313805092117
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand				56.745568012178616
if you know why don t you tell she is under the big chestnut tree replied the spoiled brat as he gave in spite of his mother s commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare				3070.5751570073007
as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life				327.1145393616206
faith no thank heaven replied raoul but what has become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were murdering i fear we arrived too late				704.9207897880077
and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked cavalcanti				195.10644183399737
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram				9364.02437937527
he will come and visit the comte de la fere d artagnan tried to gather from the expression of his eyes whether porthos understood the importance of that visit but porthos did not even look toward him				3.047185065202381
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds				24772.013018672988

what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go why i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily bravo porthos				623.7282156708723
perhaps you would prefer being alone no replied he i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the opera balls				1198.2510070860246

emmanuel julie farewell how farewell exclaimed julie do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport needless delays but increase the grief of parting said monte cristo and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite at least i advised him to do so i have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner				305.19548655980714

according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the door				9.185276081882112
athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier				15489.811662065484
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen				573.8110535236945

now an englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us and our masters asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion mousqueton smiled disdainfully				2421.0045300000575
my arm and my life belong to you like my love then said milady since you are as generous as you are loving she stopped				351.2557421698522
then proposals from any quarter will be agreeable to you since for the moment you have no master but god it is possible have you my dear aramis thought sometimes of those happy happy happy days of youth we passed laughing drinking and fighting each other for play certainly and more than once regretted them it was indeed a glorious time well those splendidly wild days may chance to come again i am commissioned to find out my companions and i began by you who were the very soul of our society aramis bowed rather with respect than pleasure at the compliment				8381.794331501222
we were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the place royale said the wounded man				1.201161393834293
let us talk of your happy return my boy				971.3426362506683
say when shall it be				257.2064511026851
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back				481.67377742280274
you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker so that as you confess you are jealous no i am pleased so pleased that i wished to congratulate you but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed andrea you speak to me before my servant how can i help that my boy				625.5104993104113
but if i mistake not continued he here he is you won t forget the boy sir raoul put his hand in his pocket				76.47520071275792
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance				213.42307891303344
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway				1571.2814838848974
noirtier burning with impatience and terror was in despair at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the light of a friend than a servant				511.7590986708466
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands				22.98527606566837
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well				579.5883087129816
and now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary thing what is that madame money mme				216.10695126171083
i will call for them today no tomorrow i shall not have time today well tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil may i depend on it certainly because i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it now see here will that be all				133.51014091008102
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century				1507.8994403760455
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count				170.9192944040637
messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinal s guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you				60.51720379027471
do you know the decision we have come to mother have we come to any yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside mercédès sighed				492.65497166826674
the moment that d artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity				991.9583210271287
well i would secure for myself a fortune independent of him even if i acquired it by placing my interests in hands unknown to him madame danglars blushed in spite of all her efforts				2727.759374722661
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurator s wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears i madame said porthos drawing himself up proudly how so the signs just now and the holy water				3188.568979589173
nor was that surprising				27882.27283657398
dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek				16500.45926349207
you hear madame yes sire i hear stammered the queen				15.370758967219937
well then you shall see it now in a second d artagnan had made three terrible thrusts at mordaunt all of which touched but only pricked him				7.348216292651058
if his excellency will recollect if he will think ah true observed monte cristo i recollect now				668.2016735505625
well he said to the lieutenant				214.3552688328553
i present my letter from the queen to the superior and i bring back the dear treasure i go to seek not into lorraine not into belgium but to paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at la rochelle				48.954897732059834
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again				63.63905341196956
do you think she said with a ghastly smile that i shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters				5994.975993230434
she thinks of me then after five years of separation				3674.6853670700284
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him				4.179051172376613
it was nearly ten o clock				1.273748523648267
the pavilion at nine o clock d artagnan was at the hôtel des gardes he found planchet all ready				1275.3132248412799
upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected				1417.6242825542256
i know all these things				1177.1362746358122
i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter s hand				160.01900465602006
well after all said d artagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we have seen many other such				1608.5755653438353
d artagnan smiled this jealous anger of milady was his revenge				1627.0356810179546
monsieur he said after a moment they tell me great things of you				16.062178121130163
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness				697.8300140062904
then if he persists notwithstanding all this as that is as i have said the limit of my mission i shall have nothing to do but to pray god to work a miracle for the salvation of france				168.17109439562142
nothing good replied d artagnan shaking his head				6.073214779018861
i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise if i would				5175.306596088129
oh said d artagnan we don t now make war as we did formerly				6206.176029710592
the old man appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the abbé busoni who looked cold and calm as usual				1073.7365593659333
though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his grief				1120.8696348420397
if your daughter had committed only one crime and i saw her meditating another i would say warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her life in a convent weeping and praying if she had committed two crimes i would say here m de villefort is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with one that has no known antidote quick as thought rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt give her that poison recommending her soul to god and save your honor and your life for it is yours she aims at and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations				8581.266628201965
but morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets				7896.572126524304
i have therefore chosen this drawing room where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my mother s and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals				6992.219903811388
once outside the city d artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood				9386.609331657623
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference				13106.362532046815
to no one on my honor everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the island of elba and addressed to m noirtier everybody except the person who gave it to me and that was too much far too much murmured villefort				44.624513520846826
and now said d artagnan as there is no longer any fear of being overheard i hope you are going to let me into your secret i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory gentlemen said athos				4.511194591262907
mazarin wrote a few words which he gave to this man then he bowed				227.82339543264857
maximilian has just returned has he not madame asked the count				10.781209483415399
yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate in four days said morrel it is extraordinary indeed said château renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too				2227.5333076269144
as i told you my dear morrel m de morcerf will kill me morrel looked at him in utter amazement				521.3074729315007
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond raised his head and listened				1910.6552603581185
do you know that i am to be beheaded outside this window				103.44213112048809
the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo and we will go another and if you please by the corso				830.536309083256
i merely ask you did you not refuse to go to brussels for the queen whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal that is the very reason i refused to go back to brussels				9760.743433402611
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented				28696.437770117067
so much the better it proves that we know how to keep our secrets i do not reproach you monsieur said d artagnan tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked aramis haughtily				161.82915432936187
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property				1085.9966855248558
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams				1358.987453615274
the ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with teresa in his arms				76.24864415754716
at ten o clock the vessel cast anchor in the harbor of dover and at half past ten d artagnan placed his foot on english land crying here i am at last but that was not all they must get to london				384.9333351063887
on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell				804.3702409413305
well sir replied eugénie i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eugénie				959.0076826901513
two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling				7.601891388838456
oh the devil said porthos i am sorry for that it would have been one language more when i speak of the pure parliament resumed the host i mean the one which colonel bridge has weeded ah				140.88294697785997
happy beyond measure well i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health d artagnan almost leaped with joy				19.364765437602383
cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars asked beauchamp				88.83927195828468
the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner				307.8052851446641
and you believe he died of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse				21.217706275693583
they say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the feet				3745.675730530545
a draught of wine d artagnan oh i ll answer for you said the gascon filling porthos s glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your opinion upon what asked porthos				9.57816662517304
the only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once				63.93088524538072
i will not continued he after a moment s silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale				56.8206505713466
parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep				1065.3136195507116
spada died on the threshold of the vineyard the nephew expired at his own door making signs which his wife could not comprehend				3903.94913839302
the priest stole the sacred vases and sold them but as they were preparing to escape together they were both arrested				1679.426327605913
remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your master s head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for you				4.019048619256783
grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened				545.2860608452622
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore				715.9718305391339
what does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind at once implacable and generous				3761.3437300213704
how few to day exist plague on t my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me no i only brought you here to ask you returned mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers monsieur d artagnan				1.996895345103654
caderousse approached him just as danglars whom fernand seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a corner of the room				33.3240695559539
he arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before mercédès with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched say mercédès he said once for all is this your final determination i love edmond dantès the young girl calmly replied and none but edmond shall ever be my husband and you will always love him as long as i live fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils said but if he is dead if he is dead i shall die too if he has forgotten you mercédès called a joyous voice from without mercédès ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of love you see he has not forgotten me for here he is and rushing towards the door she opened it saying here edmond here i am fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him				1.7887844179225505
with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount				3487.8859491370877
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy				35275.078667391615
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy				2912.9429559638093
my very self replied planchet but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud proud toward an old friend				45.130160136760175
that s all right said the man hop in and we re off				920.7895901536589
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned				43467.73789657666
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion that in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe				4127.527057026771
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground				146.56083322004358
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced				8110.320286855509
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared				112.4447710696527
then listen to me				12.075737826494331
they might have been supposed to be following tracks so observant were they wherever they went				800.8382020591016
when he came home he formed his handkerchief into a loop				23990.220210029216
that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it and that is why on account of the living mercédès and my deceased father i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand and i have revenged myself and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that i am satisfied madame that he did what i have told you besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards that a stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and murdered ali				10495.424179612823
february 5th 1815 said he it is the day my father was murdered valentine and villefort were dumb the eye of the old man alone seemed to say clearly go on but it was on leaving this club said he my father disappeared noirtier s eye continued to say read he resumed the undersigned louis jacques beaurepaire lieutenant colonel of artillery étienne duchampy general of brigade and claude lecharpal keeper of woods and forests declare that on the 4th of february a letter arrived from the island of elba recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the bonapartist club general flavien de quesnel who having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be devoted to the interests of the napoleon dynasty notwithstanding the title of baron which louis xviii				3021.416802133981
porthos cried athos and laughed aloud				649.783216344317
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased				7071.815591225828
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance				433.553742639101
d artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen				867.3940683427408
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away				373.8243980899629
well the abbé adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage				8071.408324302035
my poor brother was ignorant of this sentence				1066.4531222142843
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope				1491.6841408649325
then she suddenly cried oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall				1191.439704164874
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry				441.6115884332744
the citizens always took up arms readily against thieves wolves or scoundrels often against nobles or huguenots sometimes against the king but never against the cardinal or spain				1034.5471308144292
weigh your words before you speak for my eyes have already become brighter and my heart beats strongly be cautious or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies				6128.743832669428
porthos was discontented with his condition				6449.716518023214
you see i destroy it oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness itself listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have done oh command and i will obey listen this is not a command but advice i give you speak and i will follow your advice i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice				952.112413552918
therefore if you part with m baptistin give me the refusal of him by all means that is not all give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of the cavalcanti and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mother s side at least and a baroness in right of her father i will help you in the search ah ha you will do as much as that will you yes well really nothing is certain in this world oh count what a service you might render me				195.90238527411444
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting				9592.871585639754
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father s mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank				1590.5895733174627
the challenge then continued beauchamp i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen				1587.4920406817496
i say that valentine is dead replied d avrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness				1244.8662469659282
my lord said d artagnan will lend his which is of no use to him to the comte de la fere willingly said the cardinal i will even ask the count to keep it for my sake i promise you my lord never to part with it replied athos				6.014388990013136
d artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon d artagnan s sword				1464.061927148277
king of france who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy				1532.01427019913
forsooth i don t know half a pistole if you can find out said d artagnan				1.014999866774401
with steady gaze he awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative				3479.049185030937
of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile				51.073227734517324
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition				6738.288868221731
mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at boulogne sur mer and promise me to set out to morrow morning i promise my lord replied mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave mordaunt bowed				116.91759426985257
it was my forgetfulness then pardon me now asked athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening				3118.2723971091223
it was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility				5937.893989371454
notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers d artagnan felt completely solitary				1997.868916077291
be easy my dear edmond we are near the conclusion				5013.764372166151
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me edmond replied who knows				382.46190265104855
at the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his foreknees				313796.1684361202
i go said he i go at once how you will go said mme				37.864306390138715
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer				1031.1262642569575
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captain s feet				652.3260848936135
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp				1645.9509318491728
have i any need to tell you so				24.553251460956957
the first risk that dantès ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven o clock might perceive the change that had been made fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue dantès had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word				64.67874556728783
this manoeuvre transparent to the duc de beaufort was quite unintelligible to la ramee				50.016039323804584

but he stopped doubtless to reflect for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to lord de winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queen s carriage had left the court				235.9414000667281

you were walking one day behind the chartreux when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere				3545.8001810386395

and how proceed it is now eleven answered grimaud				69.82910044161578
villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the corpse				910.1011229593873

remove from me the remains of doubt which if it change not to conviction must become remorse the count bowed his head and clasped his hands together				170.71997856856012
one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory				3235.8424859096526
beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage				139.11850159520307

the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him				7.638521615844973
i offer my best respects and services to you my lord d artagnan then returning to the officer said sir have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say tis by his eminence s order and that i shall await him at the stables the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter				343.66974359003706
speak you condemned me to a horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness who are you then				80.35946603994792
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome				144.8128085212786
the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way				625.9810427113591
ah i shall know how to make you leave your home replied albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which monte cristo did not lose sight of				879.014961010231
we can not leave you here so and yet we can not stay go go exclaimed dantès				70.03574779809202
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went				1027.232650405789
27 repeated the count who seemed to hear the voice of the abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his name				9870.997824848106
unhappy father said monte cristo				1.020652771377012
explain to me why going out of this chamber isn t everything because having neither arms nor password we shouldn t take fifty steps in the court without knocking against a sentinel very well said porthos we will kill the sentinel and we shall have his arms yes but before we can kill him and he will be hard to kill that swiss he will shriek out and the whole picket will come and we shall be taken like foxes we who are lions and thrown into some dungeon where we shall not even have the consolation of seeing this frightful gray sky of rueil which no more resembles the sky of tarbes than the moon is like the sun				963.2368573026126
whither are you taking me asked he				7.660797749701621
two of the men from jacopo s boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles				952.9208811940513
d artagnan passed through the iron gate and arrived in front of the chateau				5058.082764691976
dantès reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge				5468.460412876681
each of the captains then led his company to the louvre where the king held his review				335010.1801089693
i had but one gerfalcon and he died day before yesterday indeed sire i wholly comprehend your disappointment				3991.6720594444455
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé dantès spoke no more of escape				808.9343883322873
noirtier looked the permission which she solicited				24788.98116997393
you have taken your revenge for the rue férou and even exceeded it you ought to be satisfied if your majesty is so said tréville we are oh yes i am added the king taking a handful of gold from la chesnaye and putting it into the hand of d artagnan				1.0740973952139115
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion				2121.735858545187
every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs				4897.139583498851
the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on progressively				22697.178901374627

the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman				16652.092075497752
no she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty				193.42405382426503
bring them here the waiter did as he was desired				1979.7312101017412
dawn was shedding its pallid placid glimmer on the purple ocean when at the distance of a musket shot from them was seen a dark gray mass above which gleamed a triangular sail then masters and servants joined in a fervent cry to the crew of that vessel to hear them and to save				5333.018440780219
then you shall not leave this place said he				11.187382460533247
you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you an agreeable one asked the italian				4013.349269779109
listen there were in truth at that epoch four devoted hearts four loyal spirits four faithful swords who saved more than my life my honor ah				60.46052663409057
this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville s house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances				12320.933250198805
tis then all settled				12964.692866249386
and make la ramee eat the pear answered grimaud				44.582720603063855
i carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one no said lord de winter we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england oh very well replied aramis then bending his face down to athos s ear what is the object of this visit continued he				38.84544099922192
will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client				3553.8438263938783
and why revenge he asked				25.804117123259157
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priest s wig the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé				1718.4888880398098
if you go out do not go out alone when you eat use every precaution				1369.753889752992
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon				574.5352202725898
he has gone said he and the house door is shut he has gone to make his report and to say that all the pigeons are at this moment in the dovecot well then let us all fly said athos and leave nobody here but planchet to bring us news a minute				1100.383631674287
i do not reproach you athos for what you have done				189.00772938898422
now i can promise you that a frenchman might show himself in public either in tunis constantinople bagdad or cairo without being treated in that way that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either				1332.6520547359264
if he comes out we shall catch him				33.17894390079897
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously				13678.787195988352
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us				133.84108660793117
scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent				8624.758442168346
well albert said franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels				16470.760597170975
there was a great deal going on that morning and many business like persons at the palais business like persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer				4822.053356497928
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged				25929.843257422206
grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door well don t be inactive inactive my dear fellow				1534.158388255759

that is the reply i beg you to make to lord de winter				3.4994649570477323
i embrace you with all my heart				75.16168477335998
i promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you				16.87429332673915
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile you are sagacious i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me you				21.66402038634121
d artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer s pretty wife for three hours that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him nothing				266.70864492851865
the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst d artagnan was looking at bazin he pronounced the words of the holy sacrament and retired giving the benediction which was received by the kneeling communicants to the astonishment of d artagnan who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself the famous jean francois gondy who at that time having a presentiment of the part he was to play was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving				8578.07556557111
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve				19830.446841741097
the bustle which had been observed by henrietta maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason was occasioned by the battle of lens announced by the prince s messenger the duc de chatillon who had taken such a noble part in the engagement he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the lorraine party as well as from the spaniards upon the arches of notre dame				19.368487032579154
d artagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled curses				220773.2832529247
approach then said the messenger or i will come nearer to you if you prefer it i will agree to neither one nor the other replied the young soldier place the object which i desire to see in the ray of light which shines there and retire while i examine it be it so said the envoy and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the place pointed out to him by selim				1476.044343858409
see how regularly i live and how easy i am here				270.4013666199439
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her				32.678721200022025
as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him				5.0331982034501115
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers				903.2288135927337
after continuing some time in profound meditation the young man suddenly exclaimed i have found what you were in search of faria started have you indeed cried he raising his head with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered the corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not 0207m it does and is not above fifteen feet from it about that well then i will tell you what we must do				118.04520204877534
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource				2191.0262501757256
i have taught you how to handle a sword you have thews of iron a wrist of steel				2377.634603153179
he has i repeat the longest head of the four and for my part i declare that i will obey him				12.189304088574591
it was fourteen years day for day since dantès arrest				4315.186979650726
fifty cavaliers cried the gascon and porthos				76.78923439081849
he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain				1490.344671454855
he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate				464.0309390987602
i would rather find it triply bolted and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth				1583.8362814316931
listen milady said the cardinal the affair is important				4961.182576898114
she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again				118.30858714279712
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also				1464.2050485647367
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness what do you say edmond i say since you command me mercédès i must die die				301.1941546323017
fortunately as we have said they were within a hundred paces of the city they left their two nags upon the high road and ran toward the quay				197.2032653517607
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently				1459.682904716917
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle				7440.787577162162
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg™ works				355.4806378608624
my funds are deposited there and you can understand that if i draw out ten millions on the same day it will appear rather strange to the governor				783.3286065345864
speak then i am all ears d artagnan related his adventure with mme				211.58597645593397
this amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to paris so that if the messengers and the spies had failed his eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed				928.5434822974717
ah monsieur said she you have saved me permit me to thank you madame said d artagnan i have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place you owe me no thanks oh yes monsieur oh yes and i hope to prove to you that you have not served an ingrate				21878.24374765865

it was nearly eight o clock when they set out again				93.67538485082304
m de tréville was the father of his soldiers				796.2639186228561
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs what say you duke i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these never ending labors				8187.481917960986
and i for planchet said d artagnan				1.012037992412102
this time he could not blame dantès				530.0893301815325
mordioux answered d artagnan i believe we must				166954.1576022829
it goes without saying that when he saw a huguenot coming he felt himself filled with such ardent catholic zeal that he could not understand how a quarter of an hour before he had been able to have any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion				5909.568401507085
who is in command here asked the cardinal				19.701828724954584
but as for me i have been a coward i have denied god and he has abandoned me 50213m mercédès burst into tears her woman s heart was breaking under its load of memories				4393.176611347042
only leave him in the ante room as i wish to speak to you alone d artagnan bowed and thought both at the same hour both commands alike both at the palais royal				2.44779557634166
i must go thither tonight instantly				1843.2633351346228
i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one				1255.7407051074542
at the extremity of the wood d artagnan perceived the road that had been described to him and at the end of the road he saw the towers of an immense feudal castle				3316.9344093000013
your excellency he said the master of the hôtel de londres has sent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from the viscount of morcerf a letter from the viscount exclaimed franz				59.787976380767894
to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it				7.429459494676611
his plan is very simple				3914.0853726405235
no nothing at all				20.714851096334545
your friend albert de morcerf				28.347306389379114
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin				52.50657782606859
caderousse was like fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier				12144.047625841267
but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together ma foi said maximilian in consternation				7069.084714039798
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem				18254.452587324253
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master benedetto at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprised groom retired				1068.5268645397496
say the devil my dear friend said d artagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you say oh gentlemen said the host i have been wrong				710.8836473934672
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her				20.89315925036638
have i not explained your wishes grandpapa said valentine addressing noirtier				236.84361570793232
at the moment he opened the door the three musketeers and d artagnan conducted by la chesnaye appeared at the top of the staircase				842.6826090919416
dantès raised his head and saw faria s eyes injected with blood				1218.5295031470218
i would rather have had a hat said d artagnan				1.0105794666936756

and now you are assembled gentlemen said d artagnan permit me to offer you my apologies at this word apologies a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis				18.993015244682454
he is i think the son of general d épinay he is the same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815 by the bonapartists yes				8741.825626726268

the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions				3654.217003508467
as to porthos oh as to porthos faith that s a droll affair and in spite of himself the young man began to laugh aloud looking round carefully however to see that his solitary laugh without a cause in the eyes of passers by offended no one				631.2466576672613
porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after d artagnan				1.1728166413996388
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but d artagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down to night upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur d artagnan to the end of the world				473.5977955796

a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard				7306.56285154209
from that day d artagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven				268.0997568995923

but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper				4265.56435237973
i wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit				15083.417522784086

the count is not and should we meet with one of your patrol we must defend ourselves tis true where can we find another sword asked porthos				12.308976213565838
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said d artagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it there is no desert where a bird can not pass over one s head where a fish can not leap out of the water where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal				1325.0420153713887
as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse				10502.062388541355

no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him				3.761752320448088

the cardinal as his majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the king s gaming table				768.8182115017988
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me hark said morrel				26.37745254312253

ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese your family name is monte cristo sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess my dear vicomte returned monte cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received				582.5663501073611

from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them				12.799517592727787
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets				22696.35637904889

he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica				975.2968908681437

all our servants are busy discussing the grand affair				1310.1944390138626
had morrel been a more quick sighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the king s procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department				2703.7223697854215

the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done oh m de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint méran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles				4316.998084125906

this desperate resistance could not last long				1354.66365757451
planchet said d artagnan i am going out for all day perhaps				2353.490228337963
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness				6084.315475326376
as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio				110.55303466236332
five answered groslow one every two hours d artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive				18826.117472350004
he resolved to adopt the second and began that day to carry out his resolve				12061.03871731804
he thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself				59.62026476852921
since that time many things have happened to you				10.987461309316368
mazarin leaned out of the window				77.94186514385771

let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds d artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family				391.14265575356853
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that d artagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queen s letter and for which he had repaid m de wardes with such terrible coin				6355.993538434934
then the inconvenience became distress				13850.723633804211

all four were to meet the next day at eleven o clock				1.1481965792809452
my brother in law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in vain				129.27332222008977

in a turn of the hand she muffled him up in a flowered robe a large hood and a cloak				1066.1744872075433
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of d artagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late d artagnan had already recognized mme				80.46751981429144

believe me continued tréville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set out ah you are right monsieur said d artagnan but you know athos porthos and aramis and you know if i can dispose of them without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to know we are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all proof				7780.852273048055

ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better this exclamation which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder				1795.313936586096
now we have in a dungeon about twenty feet distant and to which you descend by another stair an old abbé formerly leader of a party in italy who has been here since 1811 and in 1813 he went mad and the change is astonishing				12220.842914477354
from that moment the old man s eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it				35.4416028741155
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again sir said aramis you speak to the point				226.5610943560342
but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond				1225.308109052863
athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not d artagnan				1.1590255515842183
the woman especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals				17789.70228891338

albert and franz looked at each other fearing really to abuse the count s kindness				3933.2363511336857
my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart and he gave him his hand				42.75381174142111
behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish				7773.116644803769
i would not go at all said aramis				5.337405103686603
either help me to gain the nearest village or swear to me on your salvation that you will send me the first monk the first curé the first priest you may meet				10983.334625346193

your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable				5062.0301428212315
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son				1642.8317555549022
you knew we were there and yet wished to kill your friend the chevalier i did not recognize the chevalier in armor sir said raoul blushing though i might have known him by his skill and coolness in danger thank you for the compliment my young friend replied aramis we can see from whom you learned courtesy				23103.227025783162

it appeared then to d artagnan that m bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon				1081.649825981786
madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action				1263.2177359773711

madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon				508.9993148771483
i would almost answer for planchet well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him twice why good god				156.02048553053717

hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough a violent convulsion attacked the old man				1.7774381392278744
hence it resulted when d artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard				1074.3951900572692
d artagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand				13.731347508514975

she with a still smiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone				386.4706957165618
he felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition teresa might escape him				2.8639782141129215
the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary				4703.298742191359
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison				1047.1953491016393
d artagnan jumped into the saddle then the old companions in arms again shook hands				764.4268220784244
my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal monsieur de morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made nay i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands oh pray name it i am wholly a stranger to paris it is a city i have never yet seen is it possible exclaimed albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world				29.79215630742772

and so i did replied caderousse though once i confess i envied him his good fortune				495.68787554367407
wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting up				411.8000241509497
the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday				5454.881455518314

just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears				1283.0787057512446
meanwhile sir watch always watch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here				429.08827798602255

what is it asked d artagnan who did not at all comprehend the hilarity of his friend				130.5162357723667
will that do capitally replied m de busigny				32233.824708123873
d artagnan came the next day to milady s and finding her in a very ill humor had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m de wardes that provoked her thus				612.1821430746611
and he had five millions in your hands alone				292.38780943683315
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another				724.4380782292013

i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money today and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to danglars				345.7106092100408
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention				775.5012673504433
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together				241.58727083718622
why what good would it do asked caderousse				22.171212179816283
has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands				61.35966052383786
but be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody you hear him cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him				8.001247548981105
i as a philosopher should like a little country house a cottage down there under the trees without so many free stones over my poor body				470.29106194005186
what do you wish to say about it i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified to what do you refer				45718.22372204591

through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind not of the woman but of the poet				28799.962059793343
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglars excuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery				88776.31070677063
it is a mercy to let me die for if i live i shall lose my reason and become mad				1228.7215000485103

milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes				12.00603856097654
this morning i awoke at six o clock				1.1208088413114035
what do you mean beauchamp oh yes do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the minister s said beauchamp placing his eye glass in his eye where he tried to make it remain				3221.7857906760414

a sob was the only sound he heard				236.93477246589225
albert s love had not taken away his appetite				11276.506401085557
at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franz s imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina				3862.1224465749538
do you recollect that ball count where you produced such an effect 50121m no i do not replied monte cristo without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching morrel who was holding his breath with emotion				1969.4963754908956
they are men who do nothing for nothing you know the only reply that i desire said d artagnan the only one worthy of you and of me and he drew nearer to her				28.53852531877123
which whichever of the three you like i have no preference and the rich caparison is that mine too without doubt you laugh d artagnan no i have left off laughing now that you speak french what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silver are they all for me for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos peste they are three superb animals i am glad they please you why it must have been the king who made you such a present certainly it was not the cardinal but don t trouble yourself whence they come think only that one of the three is your property i choose that which the red headed boy is leading it is yours good heaven				1688.7414957806939

in the bedroom in which this passage ended bernouin encountered madame de beauvais like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs and madame de beauvais undertook to prepare anne of austria who was in her oratory with the young king louis xiv to receive the cardinal				2844.8745481384117
tis a bad example				645.7606624912348

i am not your uncle i know you not my uncle replied mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in london you dare not				95.5195957066717
about this time the nurse s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman entered the room with a cup in her hand				16.76344320445753
undoubtedly the call came from faria s dungeon				951.7034450894371
in the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice let the justice of god be done and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it				15.694423139098856

well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat				1470.4180971654719
when the sergeant on entering the room announced that in all probability he was bringing in two mazarinists it appeared to be the unanimous opinion of the officers on guard that they ought not to pass				1311.0587523855982
the doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel mockery muttered athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which porthos had just mounted				5515.7090537044305
she saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan				4100.3265958465545
a portion of the troops had already arrived and the remainder was expected from moment to moment				3779.6969039455494
i own myself conquered				4807.222511399506
d artagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished				15478.79549348848
monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when pistache would have learned a few new tricks				9798.945903060952

andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper				2620.550073319877
fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to athos to ask charity athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going				573.4210119667744
certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence				612.2270990490498

our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant				2128.4207005832864
but really my dear count we are talking as much of women as they do of us it is unpardonable albert rose				7370.7122536693205
pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my excuse				445.074129908169
as you will replied the duke				11.634568204379196

dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now				349.2557435411164
that monsieur d artagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king				187.4226991888098

do you talk of your honor				1327.3236174781716
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate				48759.98795694847
he is alone said grimaud				103.29977841063018

the room of the retired baker the evening of the day on which the count of morcerf had left danglars house with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance m andrea cavalcanti with curled hair moustaches in perfect order and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the banker s house in rue de la chaussée d antin				286.11150345384357
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz				318.5801379733916
some time after our rupture you wished to study music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful appearance at the théâtre italien at the same time i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london				1494.8784049124797
but scarcely had he expressed his request when the unknown who remained standing before the musketeer drew back with signs of terror and refused				1024.8441172295204

franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up albert s glass and began in his turn to survey the audience				1914.4381244966455
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the man s countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing				53242.04300790342
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive				12350.90905703879
at these words he gave me a ring				2500.567810921444
whilst d artagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris				280.6394237453425
alas murmured edmond can it be he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was open				421.7946021416182
his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one				749.7490711857347
i want to know what crime i have committed to be tried and if i am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty are you well fed said the inspector				28.80616723271267
edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins				2242.9646192157916
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell				319.780362127837
it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything				487.1067207636638
20029m as to the note which accompanied this the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dantès situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt				2639.87569588012
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker s feet he could not have experienced greater terror				602.450932233029
i began to fear that he would not come				389.92495742158275
who occupies number 3 the little fellow who arrived last night in a post chaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish				909.0125097656166
the count went out first then albert				93.64389927084073
you are right and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos				6.638465234481287
good so much the better said caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice				2894.7734085252937
carefully closing the box door ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian				67497.01911320354
if i were a man that would barely be possible but what can a woman do				449.66778911748287
no i did not say i was a stranger to you				22.41488477117612
you must depart instantly monsieur				166.94331498641714
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence				1417.5120749900848
you hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the cause				1847.0792268742885
the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him				5.886156708480546
oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him				9.504426350875429
and they separated with courteous gestures				62973.80762055356
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him				2.2718601832954177
it is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed in fact as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit				449169.58587282035
anne questioned d artagnan by a look				135.51113343146707

exordium repeated the curate for the sake of saying something				5079.7297676394255
d artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army				375.99215947427683
in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on d artagnan s finger the place of the queen s ring carefully kept in a casket				6829.294351290988
we will give the fifty pistoles to the hostess for our expenses said d artagnan and share the three hundred we will share said porthos				8.866702352351522
athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road				467.2680323147393
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me i had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant				397.1541352196451
do you understand it now athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmen s clothes which the four friends immediately put on they then left the hotel athos carrying a saw porthos a vise aramis an axe and d artagnan a hammer and some nails				2239.0834521553306
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost oh yes yes lost beyond redemption				22348.509819937517
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil				27747.783854400062

the general was stout and tall the president offered him the side of the railing to assist him in getting down				371.0433467682126
i have committed no crime				2194.5269093696475
morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding				14927.607593139186
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldn t surprise me at all perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us nonsense				7612.440536169141
and what do you believe his voice was stifled by sobs				2502.6684451456736
who could have thought it				30.7833603793567
tomorrow this order will be sent to the duke of buckingham				100.84012661074178
athos required no more				774.4565814680927
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the child s face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young				3159.666670558332
they were passed by a sort of courier covered with dust the bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal giving testimony to the valor of d artagnan and porthos				259.7660845768933
dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire				267176.19948223763
i say you wished to avenge yourself on me and i say that it is horrible do not think so brisemont said d artagnan do not think so				37.57367502182859

they passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers				2917.7486868896112
there is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from you				45.24986074082325
but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred names that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire				5549.376662951381
we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel son of marseilles				1053.5431672190803
the count knit his brow				105.16408762737281
and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes good he accepts said monte cristo				1.0072823761950271
do you intend to struggle against our ill fortune				861.9918988188602
pardieu cried d artagnan you could not have arrived in better time the dinner can not have had time to get cold				9816.520905860567
a paltry piece of business murmured d artagnan crumpling his note				6029.952885364746
the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived monte cristo at the door				8.049547457066545
and you have a letter yes there it is give it to me then and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read				2514.888408678467

you say he loves you maximilian how do you know that he does				1014.4486520877608
he was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him				14.316400980588263
he was a fine tall slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty with black eyes and hair as dark as a raven s wing and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger				2197.5479431218773
grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening				187.63757864175759
he turned and was about to utter an exclamation of surprise when the other made to him a sign of silence				801.4456046533428
tell me i beseech you what ails you cried dantès letting his chisel fall to the floor				380.953567592408
i may be besieged in my turn and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master lord monsieur				167.4011117610057
the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated				2663.1837995069914
one individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could				3074.797779405536
d artagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting				37983.552784721
if you had only to deal with four men d artagnan i would allow you to go alone				330.73066404951607
de guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than raoul who was only fifteen				15969.84060299224
i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded				2210.0520179906157

when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade				89010.62983056912
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening				1348.4740991533358
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies				88565.83269293724
the queen saving monsieur de buckingham her lover nothing more just				5979.6505042000335
thus the greater number of a man s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it				3.729858763792509
i supplicate you i implore you on my knees let me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself				87.1538727775148
d artagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen				78.76647821976921
i understand said morrel i am to wait yes but delay may ruin our plan sir replied the young man				1.3389474181602636

is he living patience monseigneur we are coming to it				15.000844774130288
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land				3287.733814987898
life is so uncertain that we ought to secure happiness while it is within our reach well sir said danglars in case your proposals which do me honor are accepted by my wife and daughter by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled				3061.610014594686
i was still unable to divine for what reason m de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth				362.2946974649509
the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench				5709.643580608497
noble and unhappy king are you wounded cried aramis				6.599724982837159

i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastisement who told you that i loved him asked milady sharply				616.0219668022805
one arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of germain pillon s graces 23 but the fore arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed				848.7113166213178
at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder				37504.030054957126
he was telling me this morning that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in france or england of multiplying his millions but remember that though i place great confidence in busoni i am not responsible for this never mind accept my thanks for the client you have sent me				8.441649747866132

the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son				354.64071057692064
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour				699.9261614846279

morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past nine				5442.145801809349
if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperor s intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched my friend said my mother when your master s orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly				2682.420890782381

planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to d artagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him				4.184835075545052

on the evening of the 4th of september m morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study				6248.001535360825
this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to repair his intrusion				58461.84112117764
i may acknowledge this to a daughter whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a crime this is not to the purpose said eugénie let us speak candidly sir i admire candor oh said danglars i can when circumstances render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice				12208.588314192348
at nine o clock madame la première présidente arrived				701.1932237623093

it was useless to search at night and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning				219.43311651497274
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them				11.082072921630594
nevertheless while acknowledging the truth of what he said i thought proper to insist but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself				39.59471614638527

i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon				1160.945072185701
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord				7862.066495600246
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences which even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes were seen to be utterly futile				4327.038779473383
b constance bonacieux or camille de bois tracy silence monsieur				651.0243830391796

all the servants surrounded her offering her assistance				3298.2480020334265
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness				10604.031765171165
after some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him				117.98527018701023
from the comte de la fere said aramis				4.37049504193672
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty				370.5924564500099
haydée is a very uncommon name in france but is common enough in albania and epirus it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocence it is a kind of baptismal name as you parisians call it oh that is charming said albert how i should like to hear my countrywomen called mademoiselle goodness mademoiselle silence mademoiselle christian charity				5760.689911896174
debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the minister and besides albert looked at his tablets it is the hour i told the count 21st may at half past ten and though i do not much rely upon his promise i wish to be punctual				12460.40384338649
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window				297.6347494046489
i know that by name at least that is it precisely signor aladdin it is hashish the purest and most unadulterated hashish of alexandria the hashish of abou gor the celebrated maker the only man the man to whom there should be built a palace inscribed with these words a grateful world to the dealer in happiness do you know said franz i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies judge for yourself signor aladdin judge but do not confine yourself to one trial				12231.943230911917
first one gun l goes under then the other				171.79095871272614
franz gave him albert s letter				169.91507084340492
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queen s letter short but explicit gave him the clue				57049.764637635875
pray continue well then listen				1302.4977315092326
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed d artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock				2026.389284758646
this was the gist of his strange story the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struck it was empty				364.5134260802674
old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond				671.2828340329322
we will explain in a few words how d artagnan had been led to choose that place of residence				7245.002830829374
if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his head if anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three days if anyone had said to either of us then live the day will come when you will be happy and will bless life no matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulity and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you how often have i myself ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine look at me said monte cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive look at me				25.285227143978954
for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases madame said d artagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him what				433.0161529510221
and how did he treat you with more of mildness than severity did you tell him your whole story i did and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape				59320.21912020578
one terrible idea pressed upon her mind that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again				124.04257188521751
mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him				4.548315920848391
why he said does he enter without first asking for an audience anne colored slightly				3365.687336478031
villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity				102969.45715224728
at six o clock lord de winter came in				190.20041770650568
the journey at two o clock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrière st denis				902.3007165058182
there were also less agreeable visits for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated				1259.3529644591538
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation				12593.127714475744
not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly everyone waited anxiously				2143.148033342661
speak said athos we can not see your signs				10004.131542054489
as for grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow				83.64968397953798
villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner				894.8632503504356
as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills				14446.741727503964
nine tenths of the english people are horrified at what you say this voice was that of athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser				16908.67954613971
you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me				26.77005460731245
this permission we feel bound to say was graciously granted which compels us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of letters				2130.8741362874607
bazin remained at the window				67.13385109894115
some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt aramis shuddered in spite of himself				15.69339790786099
very good said the count				10.592488226357215
how long a start have they two hours and a quarter my officer two hours and a quarter that is nothing we are well mounted are we not porthos porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor horses				1134.2757044823982
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely				821.9475601598688
caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing				1584.8070519232858
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now it is for something else than that i imagine muttered d artagnan shaking his head doubtfully				2113.4932201195725
this circumstance pleased m de tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m de la trémouille s testimony and himself				385.66750220878185
it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime				27262.83570189244
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m morrel and then ran on to mercédès				382.7138413909053
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity				1465.443458201499
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry				4411.161828160424
then father said raoul forcing himself to convey a respect by speech that did not come from his heart if you are a priest you have an opportunity as my friend has told you of exercising your vocation				14834.708514522012
three days afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that dinner suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fish pond				26265.58747108296
what can have become of her then we shall know be assured				4769.325707159791
she was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of alabaster				43196.771682589344
a few hundred yards beyond the town d artagnan drew rein				12262.369089780414
the horses which were more kindly used than on the previous day stopped at arras at four o clock in the evening				69.0786495940048
bah it is now nearly healed and i am sure it is not that which gives you the most pain what then said aramis blushing				271.2344225263879
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place				370.89316592994294
see i have not slept said villefort showing his undisturbed bed grief does not stun me				8.06970658310639
monsieur d artagnan he cried vade retro satanas so my dear bazin said the officer laughing this is the way you receive an old friend sir replied bazin the true friends of a christian are those who aid him in working out his salvation not those who hinder him in doing so i don t understand you bazin nor can i see how i can be a stumbling block in the way of your salvation said d artagnan				1.0141384605745574
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows				218.53990133539676
today is the 5th of june yes well renew these bills up to the 5th of september and on the 5th of september at eleven o clock the hand of the clock pointed to eleven i shall come to receive the money i shall expect you returned morrel and i will pay you or i shall be dead these last words were uttered in so low a tone that the stranger could not hear them				455.6591762527648
the second operation was as successful as the first la jeune amélie was in luck				28663.889446456385
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme				793.2117742156232
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes because you do not love me madame				170.4870732670641
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it you know his business here then pardieu he has come to draw but i don t know how much you will know presently my friend very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day what do you mean of whom do you speak				624.7533606251776
oh if that were so i should lose my reason and he folded her in his arms				56.958021375841824
the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is you frighten me not executioner s axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and i strike you now waiting patiently and christianly for you to return the blow and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on				83.42828400411638
he took her to his château and made her the first lady in the province and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly well asked d artagnan				1.022287725687729
it was a strange thing and one which made d artagnan tremble from the sole of his foot to the roots of his hair to find that this soft light this calm lamp enlightened a scene of fearful disorder				20561.45169037378
have you kept him in the cellar all this time merciful heaven				140.64600731540034
the young man knelt down				99.35938601030777
raoul was seated at table with the count de guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and grimaud presented himself travel stained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner				1486.302291437203
there goes one cried athos at the end of five hundred paces				2432.8535887604994
it is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry go round wheels and rewards us				319.03604450887207
thank you she said				2.881698532507083
we have already observed with what rapidity d artagnan seized the expression of a countenance				1023.0556310180514
in fact her position was terrible				810.4173347829386
the waking when franz returned to himself he seemed still to be in a dream				520.8214795263405

you said only imagine and then paused				947.0578472733507
felton was a puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet				110.05593862977108
there are hours which last a year				200.84646874830065
you will come off splendidly at those two exercises but pass the pen over to monsieur abbé				1029.3734439593543
but said morrel the culprit the murderer the assassin do not alarm yourself sir justice will be done said villefort				60.34097238653977
edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result				5807.638106027935
m morrel had not readily given up the fight				1272.7149599636941
no said villefort only return again at eleven o clock at twelve the the oh heavens my poor poor child and the procureur again becoming a man lifted up his eyes and groaned				1708.0124618229925
m de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king				72.17995724828546
all this showed d artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something but he could not yet see under this veil				49860.34695377442
d artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him				11.367078003513528
a thousand francs but whence have you obtained them listen to me mother and do not yield too much to agitation and albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at her				20.124555321489193
d artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal				82.49784556614584
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaning therefore i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting				1964.8644116202065
you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your choice yes well then i repeat you are wrong				412.75033072163524
my valet in examining this mournful relic felt a paper in the pocket and drew it out it was a letter addressed to you baron to me cried danglars				57.44472675572895
villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others				441.57305455743597
that is because love has come suddenly upon me and for the first time and because i am only twenty the young woman looked at him furtively				160900.83305491338
he might fail but something must be left to chance				21619.003759644256
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him				102.86594814538752
at this moment he will have left elba to go whither i know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples or on the coast of tuscany or perhaps on the shores of france				112.18176190309867
it turned out as d artagnan had foreseen				116.82385926548208
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance				84.17741499590916
now they will be far from looking for us among the puritans therefore with the puritans we must go good my friend good said athos				7.103942894752051
you say you desire my mother s good opinion i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent 30111m do you think so said monte cristo with interest				4156.834145576257
you will no longer have half a dead body tied to you as a drag to all your movements				5345.213242952086
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course				617.203059879356
not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted everything depends on you explain yourself pray monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba				1325.0887715622164
no madame but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you 20269m yes i do remember replied the countess				2656.3364003445754
the diminutive abbé scarron who however was an abbé only because he owned an abbey and not because he was in orders had formerly been one of the gayest prebendaries in the town of mans which he inhabited				376.3238073788164
in the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met				8748.030447537225
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbé busoni it was your excellency the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me				12.653614256634372
your daughter will be married tomorrow if not today in a week if not tomorrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm				8401.353235235332
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart				40.02101639575824
the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women				2106.992899976512
i will give you the baton of the marechal de la meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now and so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult seriously said gondy astonished at not having further advanced i fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction and i said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it				22.877925440036055
we should command an annuity of 175 000 livres				2232.780227456952
no don t be alarmed although it is to a lady that i am going to present you and i am anxious that you should love her the young man looked at the count with a certain uneasiness but at a smile from athos he was quickly reassured				17360.046226037535
are there not some latin verses upon that subject				1677.5094755192088
captivity the first day chapter liii				23451.702306275212
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer				426.1337667895331
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of d artagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away no replied d artagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour				623.5378979670213
teresa uttered a cry of admiration				336.740489367624
why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank				8652.101166571163
what is the matter my lord said athos and what puts you out of breath thus nothing replied de winter nothing and yet in passing the heights it seemed to me and he again turned round				2315.9909382798087
good thought gondy she is going to yield she is going to have him killed said d artagnan to porthos but at all events it shall not be by me				3009.3389269022455
it was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear that i should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection				3295.6917387102776
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant you who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris really				744.2337995975142
i don t care to be shot in a box no said aramis he has not seen us				146.78211830633592
i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed				5094.482994551143
madame de saint méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to her villefort seized the doctor s hand				97.7768046779996
i saw her this morning and bade her adieu have you no particular commands to leave with me my father inquired maximilian in a faltering voice				2.6929222201764995
the young man closed the door behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard steps approaching him				1.6138041911960457
i shall give him a good dinner he will confide his son to my care i will promise to watch over him i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then i shall have done my part certainly i see you are a model mentor said albert good bye we shall return on sunday				107382.46952175834
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart				1553.4895035561758
parbleu at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day it is not that which deterred me replied monte cristo but as i determined to have a house to myself i sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it but you have then a valet de chambre who knows paris said beauchamp				285.19644257619785
bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village				1767.0807317121469
athos and aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the duc de beaufort				60.84970798978436
carmela was precisely the age and figure of teresa and teresa was as handsome as carmela				13235.650328648486
faith i do not remember the name of the hotel at the hotel of said porthos by my faith nor do i remember it either it does not matter and a few of those bottles of old burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain alas				677.1990969635312
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m noirtier				71.7052818716294
do you see that ray of sunlight i do well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you				21.932599057971384
with the duke s aid they already considered themselves invincible				11164.194261799244
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state				1603.3758632839586
aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to d artagnan whose senses were still in a state of confusion				1259.1277947332158
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum				1156.9037791669743
and these judges i warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike the eyes of milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame				1991.6520353190372
accordingly d artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him				9.50586539001427
everyone hastened to purchase moccoletti franz and albert among the rest				651.3575624646671
his family will care much about such a trifle as that				498.6051019229193
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief				115248.41842046984

lord de winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the duke s chamber				93.33572204960464
oh leave me said i				1506.07997403544
he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders				10216.136769536277
this time danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speaker s meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide				5390.738913124605
no monsieur he has not a lady with him with whom is he then with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of amiens good heavens cried d artagnan is the poor fellow worse then no monsieur quite the contrary but after his illness grace touched him and he determined to take orders that s it said d artagnan i had forgotten that he was only a musketeer for a time monsieur still insists upon seeing him more than ever well monsieur has only to take the right hand staircase in the courtyard and knock at number five on the second floor d artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old fashioned taverns				85501.06761230569
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that d artagnan had not come to béthune				2375.4758004778605

the gardens were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in countries where the luxuries of the table the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood the supper table was loaded with wax lights and flowers				937.9061251465401

the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking houses churches museums or theatres				16503.921560814684
by degrees milady became more communicative				14976.917205907133

i can not tell you i don t know him how				361.4595246019531
we set forth on our journey and have you never revisited that village eagerly asked madame de chevreuse				65.78945330203568
immediately replied d artagnan we have not a minute to lose hello grimaud				803.5774430084779
a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on haydée seemed one of fire and blood				3108.3141520795134
d artagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword but d artagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it				12.213670377498739
but we have not done with the thing yet 0087m do you indeed think so inquired the marquise				1126.1256273285912

here it is said he				6.620688076705556

m bonacieux was at his door				149.47700133802292
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantès				134.70126607255207
ali returned a sign in the negative				59157.40198102653
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way				422.48281736348434

then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep				14858.608693728549

but m de tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d artagnan to render the king any signal service or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action				1702.695107923644

as it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal				160.50686523389427

god preserved me but a man named brisemont died in my place we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as before				145.99425007049538
is it not so madame oh my god my god murmured the queen whose teeth chattered with fright				14065.460092339601
and yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veins passion drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the reader pleases				6345.872758400744
one of us would suffice really my dear monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence and bernouin do i not take him with me there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish my lord there is time to draw back said d artagnan and your eminence is perfectly free not at all not at all said mazarin let us be off and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of d artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling				5405.771581367595
at seven o clock in the morning he arose and called planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night				67.59186429375326
good evening sir answered the soldier in a strong provincial accent				1243.0090768152036
five minutes had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance				420.77009894447275
valentine looked at m d avrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room				8.299554823108098
what do you say to that i might answer sire that he is too deeply interested in the question to be a very impartial witness but so far from that sire i know the duke to be a royal gentleman and i refer the matter to him but upon one condition sire what it is that your majesty will make him come here will interrogate him yourself tête à tête without witnesses and that i shall see your majesty as soon as you have seen the duke what then				97.6910548519348
on they all set off swift as the wind				816.7084781572796
i am anxious to know the state of your health he calls that a language				1632.8539306537439
oh no sir from my childhood i have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over me				19.414646135342714
a mournful answer awaited each of edmond s eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained				3470.3671908635106
suddenly a voice was heard at the wicket				3647.591190415677
to be a bishop aramis answered d artagnan who did not wish to undeceive porthos aramis fancy has become a monk and a jesuit and lives like a bear				16241.607186197582
athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms				11987.282348634242
no madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends and porthos turning on his heel made a step to retire				1972.8152333997296
i fancied myself despised betrayed				58012.86229714686
your hand madame your hand and i depart anne of austria stretched forth her hand closing her eyes and leaning with the other upon estafania for she felt that her strength was about to fail her				43.51868988512598
and this time the tone and manner in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived for the first time that the mandate was addressed to them				17.110635376440975
yes said château renaud these italians are well named and badly dressed you are fastidious château renaud replied debray those clothes are well cut and quite new that is just what i find fault with				263.7110238754655
edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided				33980.56963562761
on his left was porthos whilst d artagnan was on his right each guarded a door and served as a rampart to him on either side				459.3547241177685
what do you say inquired charles rising				160.91025488614167
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order				1766.8709343384198
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal s motive				9714.663421804635
then we must fly said he				9.050433631631776
he turned around and mordaunt stood before him				2.6767869437291774
mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock and i caught it mamma don t you remember interposed edward and i pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail you madame remained under the arbor do you not remember that while you were seated on a stone bench and while as i told you mademoiselle de villefort and your young son were absent you conversed for a considerable time with somebody yes in truth yes answered the young lady turning very red i do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle he was a medical man i think precisely so madame this man was myself for a fortnight i had been at that hotel during which period i had cured my valet de chambre of a fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that i really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician				9526.719395160511
the silence however could not last forever				5642.8766651492015
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject				1193.2095834748488
it was a quarter past midday				1710.9388191164169
that of a lieutenant of musketeers d artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket here my friend write your name upon it and become my chief porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to d artagnan to the great astonishment of the young man				1.4571652624968268
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head				1448.5970713928207
her mouth was small and rosy and although her underlip like that of all princes of the house of austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt				2862.438789544444
d artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to m de tréville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal s arms				95.23362326826212
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms				201.278285134361
i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition he had just completed this monologue which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue when the servant maid watching at the door suddenly cried out ah				334.1902219539243
do not exaggerate your duty				2161.607558330212
large valances of silk embroidered with flowers of gay colors which were rather faded fell from the wide windows the fittings of the room were simple but in excellent taste				1788.7376773863937
sir said the servant i have a favour to ask you speak out my friend i am afraid to do so				5.54848709586349
he awaited mazarin s promised visit to get some light on his present situation				1276.4746482176722
tell them to order number 25 to come downstairs the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number				4390.898027583729
nevertheless aramis was in a good situation and able to defend himself				46.523385096339226
as you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon ali obeyed leaving the abbé alone with caderousse who had not yet revived				2399.476132575833
perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of fate possibly and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action it is not for me to judge				10107.90581537529
here we are without occupation it seems to me you forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of charenton i hope to see monsieur de chatillon whom i ve hated for a long time there why have you hated him because he is the brother of coligny ah true				571.2715283216294
ah my head oh what agony shall i suffer like this long no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer ah i understand you said the unhappy man				5.420564553551584
listen said he i have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter valentine your daughter madeleine were concerned the doctor turned pale				89.36117213445536
then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god				1646.8019297793503
she was my mother				375.234360724148
did he speak in your hearing				28624.061232463
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximilian too rich				857.0049700648716
as this was the height of d artagnan s worldly ambition apart be it well understood from his desire of finding mme				102.45548245142768
the jesuit persisted in his opinion				1156.698030257825
albert then had fallen into the hands of the famous bandit chief in whose existence he had for so long a time refused to believe				2311.9525402923596
only i warn you that when i reside in a country i conform to all its code and i have no wish to put myself within the compass of the french laws for your sake oh do not do that excellency i have always served you faithfully cried bertuccio in despair				213.8900938943627
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great lady for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass				8455.988737187145
m noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me				4.445134835042377
besides he is almost mad now and in another year he will be quite so so much the better for him he will suffer less said the inspector				31.674729913625473
you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations				26094.61208534502
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eugénie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone haydée may hear you perhaps and you think she would be angry no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression				151.86965980097818
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera				781.9932907372897
come vicomte he said it is time for you to go to bed you will start in the morning for the army of monsieur le prince				3466.209516132958
you were in the south of france i think yes replied andrea with an embarrassed air i was in the south of france a carriage was to await you at nice precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambéry from chambéry to pont de beauvoisin and from pont de beauvoisin to paris 30133m indeed				1434.1583422726392
oh how i love you said buckingham				1069.7881442939909
i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a dinner as you i can scarcely stand the young man shuddered at this strange familiarity				14857.120889504711
yes continued his eminence under certain circumstances with that strong and shrewd mind your majesty possesses aided by your friends you were able to repel the attacks of that adversary i said the queen				9.249383705873079
nor you to mine cried the abbé				16.22830585193144
all four once more together				628.8090472233622
halt he cried this time we shall be pursued				1923.7803885333035
this silence self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face				113.29291738731052
you can not imagine mother how beautiful i think you said the young man impressed with a profound feeling of filial love				752.1281223292971
this humble picture would have but little interest for you accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said monte cristo inquiringly				7666.199452651753
saddle our horses take your carbine whom are we going to attack sir no one a mere matter of precaution answered the gascon				40.23761619060835
and aramis i see you have not forgotten the name no she said poor aramis a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses				17053.47294481915
i rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies very well replied m danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker				2298.549674133056
good day dear friend replied d artagnan				1.0138872866120932
although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief				613.5574196310458
now gentlemen said d artagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire the englishmen bowed and went upstairs				956.6568944236975
well sir i am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me and i madame replied athos am looking with admiration sir said madame de chevreuse you must excuse me but i long to know to whom i am talking				5191.327482652895
as for porthos on whom d artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute				17816.93590694836
a handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal next moment d artagnan entered				83.42024848653418
let us speak of my affairs said mazarin since you will tell me naught of yours				222.6852489075669
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her				13.813219759269636
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk				3623.44638852189
good evening comrade said d artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner				4482.4353879058945
yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable ones for i found them ugly enough to frighten me come my dear albert said debray confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes and that like madame de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a story				2620.962465729754
the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier				96435.00034588049
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls				438.41444827616044
adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme				41.750458528702204
0255m the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old man s limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open				312.58587948004475
at length parliament was convoked the authority of the king was to be maintained				3263.744814876976
i have not quitted you since yesterday returned fernand sorrowfully				291.47977673485065
so much the worse for you for by such conduct you have lost my esteem and my patronage				38927.68094010674
he feels that every man owes a tribute to his country some contribute their talents others their industry these devote their blood those their nightly labors to the same cause				2730.9166915647456
but since you say nothing remains but for m d épinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to m d épinay for he came this morning to paris valentine uttered a cry				261.97378912392463
at blois d artagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal				133.7122314603995
i did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark true said porthos				9.51822516161386
to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge you as my executioners and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm chair				257.8495487106085
as to d artagnan he did not budge from his apartment				278.33612865871817
i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said				82.59652499847026
so much the worse and so much the better it need not be said that d artagnan was still thinking of the husband				4561.889983394618
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law				338.2488838147894
father cried maximilian how could you say the pharaon was lost				189.01791389103278
i have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow				475.48450617752746
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him				11.549390022546687
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach				50577.28392214455
i understand why you accepted it and i grant you my pardon but upon one condition what is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not over				233.6230982402156
as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and renée in waiting				3501.49373779728
come sweep away all that for me				13.953684817506879
and bazin asked athos				4.434810058453765
you do not know your own good fortune and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing				134.3731270443594
what is your name in your turn if you please d artagnan to yours monsieur and above all others cried d artagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the cardinal the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of d artagnan if the wine had been bad but the wine was good and he was convinced				655.2677970475535
at this moment ali entered				223.98853504409652
the countess g insists upon it that he is a vampire then the countess g has returned to paris has she inquired the baroness				158.38218814454595
pardieu said d artagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long no said aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the philipghauts and how were they treated asked d artagnan				190.23597332308697
in business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents it is true murmured the englishman then you have but one hope but one the last the last so that if this fail i am ruined completely ruined as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port i know it sir a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me he has informed me of the arrival of this ship and it is not yours no she is a bordeaux vessel la gironde she comes from india also but she is not mine perhaps she has spoken to the pharaon and brings you some tidings of her shall i tell you plainly one thing sir				98.9251683854428
albert besides being an elegant well looking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscount a recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815 but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of 50 000 livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris				2590.9128119085462
what had you to revenge on the marquis de saint méran oh it was not on him monsieur it was on another this is strange returned monte cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse monsieur said the steward it is fatality i am sure				478.62253794982183

i really believe you are a man and a violent one too and you you are a woman a miserable woman stupid and brutal				15566.0312697191
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers				13732.56018835204

he was wrapped in a large rough cape which concealed his form and partly his face				192.95341518841573
at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a man s stout and furious thundered behind d artagnan				1.0407954463197262
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertaker s men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial				33203.73195142464
the breakfast and what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast said beauchamp				36.918091148668665
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated				2446.4095702292225
the lackeys were brought by the cries she made				720.4750276995186
tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned i am pleased sir to hear that and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned but you will be resigned my friend never he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself				203.10606545540008
ten or twelve persons had been in the secret since six o clock and howsoever great their prudence might be they could not issue the necessary orders for the departure without suspicion being generated				18009.635256149475
if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost for a man so well off will never change his happy condition and i shall fail with him as i have already done with aramis chapter xi				39310.708554437144
villefort quietly opened a window saying it is very warm and the heat affects m noirtier he then returned to his place but did not sit down				179.0106253769501
what could they desire beyond their liberty				2583.4861065245045
that is my answer the answer was terrible				1023.6616964931504
today is the twentieth of september				6283.148262843879
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and d artagnan				1.1377509789878102
and you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom have you not asked dantès eagerly				7.1744080604011735

are you ready asked felton				88.61774189230682
no one would have thought in looking at this old weather beaten floral decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange things if in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all walls are provided with it had also a voice				412.6844030646913
porthos agreed to the bargain the thing suited him wonderfully well				296.02135436552174
what do you say to this project the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king				1375.4093983696644
my dear d artagnan said aramis don t be too angry with me i beg				1524.2372226180858
no matter observed caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase it yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as i am or content himself with the same story				1054.012483927081
he fixed his haughty eye upon the stranger and perceived a man of from forty to forty five years of age with black and piercing eyes pale complexion a strongly marked nose and a black and well shaped mustache				3200.6854281437736
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at porthos				88.10341839243254
the old servant came				191.77610710460488
in all probability this time his master would not retract				16233.787021632514
villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head				104.69082335331186
but what shall you do with him with whom with albert what shall i do with albert				485.27893729846363
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newton s system				14198.534193497579
poor queen already fallen				837.83375868795
however i have managed to live thirty years without this protection you will say but i will endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning				189.27757855809418
as soon as possible m danglars today all preliminaries will be arranged at my father s and tomorrow or next day at latest the wedding festival here at la réserve				1213.1528339205627
nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of him who thinks				9628.231412544837
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him				4.998660417419568
these glances frequently exasperated the pride of danglars but this evening he took no notice of them				25.93126888738246
the cardinal s enemy no the king s friend said aramis the king s friend you understand				340.2591804079071
i am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may suppose				8693.46441016094
i have the price and d artagnan threw the bag upon the table				44.50479063057152
gentlemen continued the baroness among the ten horses in the stables of baron danglars are two that belong exclusively to me a pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in paris				329.0933401597665
the other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato 4 and he your excellency is poor peppino the fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example but peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes				11752.098169264962
milady fell down and seemed to be in a swoon				11531.366445990603
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty s well said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men				411.8874143135944
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving d artagnan s composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge you accept however i always accept do you think the thing possible everything is possible shall you be attacked on the road probably and what will you do in that case i shall pass through those who attack me and suppose you can not pass through them so much the worse for them i shall pass over them and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain yes on your life on my life you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration				401.25320687574253
well asked d artagnan				1.032612798818731
why the good god sends him back again caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair				139.36250332497448
i would take the hundred pistoles				1329.294717985643
besides what would the sailors say				265.48648875754174
pooh replied d artagnan				1.0157997601144833
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor for i am aware that m de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me a favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman				770.4924660483949
what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize you your father s name so well known in italy and so highly honored				23167.65291485294
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone				669.9187069213151
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too				610.6323083123708
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act				1139.9114076780668
i never visit ministers i leave that to the princes really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant take compassion on us or like jupiter you will wither us up i will not speak again said château renaud pray have compassion upon me and do not take up every word i say come let us endeavor to get to the end of our story beauchamp i told you that yesterday madame made inquiries of me upon the subject enlighten me and i will then communicate my information to her well gentlemen the reason people die so multitudinously i like the word at m de villefort s is that there is an assassin in the house the two young men shuddered for the same idea had more than once occurred to them				15.468231906852933
because replied d artagnan the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest and you have been here since about a quarter of an hour said d artagnan motioning to porthos not to contradict him				2.5035633890318847
she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocket mirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible				2883.2856453674967
oh dear no your excellency				2428.563937463178
come take a little oath for me on the cross i won t ask anything more of you on the cross cried i rising for at that abhorred voice i had recovered all my strength on the cross i swear that no promise no menace no force no torture shall close my mouth				1088.1426754271656
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength				450.70440816549865
you must look out for yourself what have i to fear replied d artagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties everything believe me				4.521914433950953
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea				461.6729319616077
fortunately i don t know where he is how cried d artagnan you don t know where aramis is formerly replied bazin aramis was his name of perdition				44368.62342150522
the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m de morcerf and is justified by his son				202.0270470298414
look at the arms the sergeant put the lantern near the panel				9445.39089500258
lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another inquiringly				26750.393600346804
i have paid you five hundred of them that s correct said the captain				48.611673012807685
as he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue				1126.059580904552
she required to be alone that she might put her thoughts a little into order				1407.7382914778627
he had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog				16641.64587090703
now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty				1225.628916609827
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood				2087.1508063498923
in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study				1479.3010464877489
porthos was the first to speak				282.2358617818228
andrea s hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time				744.7847746154689
i am doing a little sum in arithmetic in arithmetic yes i am calculating by the way morcerf that indirectly concerns you i am calculating what the house of danglars must have gained by the last rise in haiti bonds from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days and the prudent banker had purchased at 206 therefore he must have made 300 000 livres that is not his biggest scoop said morcerf did he not make a million in spaniards this last year my dear fellow said lucien here is the count of monte cristo who will say to you as the italians do denaro e santità metà della metà 9 when they tell me such things i only shrug my shoulders and say nothing but you were speaking of haitians said monte cristo				2220.7754280222607
here is debray who detests you without reading you so he says he is quite right returned beauchamp for i criticise him without knowing what he does				611.5073246895319
oh it would be a sacrilege				12813.796260718547
should anyone else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a word of this letter i promise it was villefort who seemed to entreat and the prisoner who reassured him				2.4353628756987002
the particular characteristic of this was that more songs were made than cannons fired during its continuance				21656.374293670106
in paris yes athos and aramis looked at each other				103.73261886439239
well undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of france are caused by mazarin her lover and her destroyer begin this work to day this instant even and in three days i shall expect the result				3891.7119256665037
the next morning when kitty presented herself at d artagnan s she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days but on the contrary sad as death				381.93575678887674
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd				789.2020842899535
but to you d artagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend				45.59936709712915
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense				7683.868676483788
the file on the corso broke the line and in a second all the carriages had disappeared				49.60166305800701
unfortunately said monte cristo one s title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of france or academician for example the millionaires franck poulmann of frankfurt who have just become bankrupts indeed said danglars becoming pale				172.45971112776155
i shall see you through the window as you mount your horse i shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight then i shall place myself at the cardinal s door a door with glass windows				292.49978623526897
alas the queen i was going to say there s no longer a queen				832.5414522879554
he is at the siege of la rochelle with the cardinal				438.6225046668771
an instant after bazin made his appearance at the door				42.36213500738664
i am quite of your opinion sir and we should soon make an end of mazarin if we had only a dozen officers like yourself without prejudices vigilant and incorruptible but said the officer i thought you were in his service and that it was he who sent you to general cromwell that is to say i am in the king s service and that knowing he wanted to send some one to england i solicited the appointment so great was my desire to know the man of genius who now governs the three kingdoms				32852.28101327261
he remained listening and gazing				13084.344954674387
order my lord he said i am ready to obey your eminence monsieur d artagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor				1091.9942794187104
i have not tried to discover her other name kitty cried milady				40.33116443730997
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them				15.32754369042866
well then said aramis				5.483046469081532
the moon which was partially obscured by heavy clouds now and then lit up the muskets of the sentinels or silvered the walls the roofs and the spires of the town that charles i had just surrendered to the parliamentary troops whilst oxford and newark still held out for him in the hopes of coming to some arrangement				7748.174863111975
i actually love no one sir you know it do you not				39.740796992104954
monsieur the abbé said he do you like blows with a cane i can not say monsieur answered i no one has ever dared to give me any well listen to me then monsieur the abbé				41.56465219380984
the door is opened to all who knock				69575.41224294485
so au revoir dear athos au revoir said the musketeer making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought				5869.711751642335
she wouldn t believe me saying that she knew anne of austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb				12832.053996908371
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port				1553.5369130168742
still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish it if you demand it why then it shall be done				123.43289770472106
i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around				676.294896980209
cries of despair resounded on all sides				1218.3511368781126
you positively recognize m de morcerf as the officer fernand mondego indeed i do cried haydée				525.9084678004991
go sir go but morrel remained motionless he could not detach his eyes from that disordered bed and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it				128.35033377792917
the history of the scuttled vessels which had appeared improbable during the day seemed very probable at night placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his eye on the crew and his gun in his hand				14.627478652688785
she revives cried the young man				2.54430432297527
bonacieux opened the door of a closet which was entirely dark and led d artagnan into it				232.5748419944509
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed				8477.782208785522
albert with his eyes closed was standing grasping the window curtains				1719.8824997186748
villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper				14592.535633883708
my name is ah				57.40094399257443
but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years what he did during these ten years god only knows				409.063433953583
i tell you so to prove to you that i still hope and after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared				75.21191322674892
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast				5700.698783567498
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant				55575.7801821765
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second				391.26838460790634
poor queen murmured athos				5.9566378438610785
if you venture again into the house in which i have met you this evening i will dare it myself i really think i must have been frightened				3792.7464029902776
but putting his head out of the carriage eh				1802.6379815399384
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men				918.1335621904208
there there said la carconte do you hear that				271.32173746703927
gaspard gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abbé said can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself				52.77646785491447
well resumed the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of caderousse s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine				110.96260244959919
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says				1868.6827037437076
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos and aramis and an officer was examining their passports				39732.842647197715
when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil what difference does that make said porthos				8.70982828486003
dantès said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die				270.689566290214
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you that is not the custom excellency said peppino				1576.571048916249
for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the father in law of his son then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key double locks his coffer and master andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a parisian family by shuffling cards or rattling the dice ah that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess he will want a crown an el dorado and potosí no these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families like jupiter they like to cross the race				17665.845607418632
now young man regulate your conduct accordingly and if you entertain whether from your family your relations or even from your instincts any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal bid me adieu and let us separate				2139.395719665629
the best swordsman in the kingdom my lord said d artagnan				1.0141584877391556
laporte could not leave the louvre she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide				5091.7484058610235
well did there not happen an event which saved austria				8178.585416932893
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement you must obtain permission in writing from the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the manager of the project gutenberg™ trademark				1068.218653444556
why i ll wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules and without staggering too done said danglars i ll take your bet but tomorrow today it is time to return				848.6194553530688
well you stand well with m morrel i hear you insinuating dog you m				127.13289587639741
at length i saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity				2249.2032850873184
what matter if you are paid for it said athos and he threw two pistoles majestically on the table				91.37742310562201
occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him sometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a president or some dowager duchess				6516.353112846711
your address at paris hôtel of the guards company of dessessart enough replied the questioner				888.8380827970034
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him				31.51489949866413
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still				1963.0672838017267
the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which monte cristo excelled				15590.604149652747
let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree without having the power any more than the wish to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung bravo villefort cried the marquis excellently well said				317.02171104093
she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte				53.86906024000065
grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture				33774.31570081734
i know it monsieur everything is turned topsy turvy in the world nowadays while this dialogue was going on the two young men and the poor lackey descended				1393.3632767097224
he then bent his body and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled				32507.960113341815
oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that valentine will be terribly revenged				11158.43571756833
then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room				17.711846733776387
a french nurse who sent me away when i was five years old because no one paid her for me telling me the name of a relation of whom she had heard my mother often speak what became of you as i was weeping and begging on the high road a minister from kingston took me in instructed me in the calvinistic faith taught me all he knew himself and aided me in my researches after my family and these researches were fruitless chance did everything you discovered what had become of your mother i learned that she had been assassinated by my relation aided by four friends but i was already aware that i had been robbed of my wealth and degraded from my nobility by king charles i oh				669.9685417474736
if i were not in such haste and if i were not running after someone said d artagnan				1.0238749975699812
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you				6.114835944035948
until this day and for how long a time he had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness				12128.815976295798
d artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance				164.16500331394747
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner				641.3353422605852
no not that way i beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the hall				2357.8282798804044
you are right duchess				1941.0824354138022
my friend said beauchamp in the most affectionate tone i should gladly make an apology but alas but what the paragraph was correct my friend what				223.22532053449913
the title attracted me i took them home with me with the permission of the guardian and devoured them				40.11002529203226
her brother replied athos				4.586523412632631
pardieu said d artagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted pardieu it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend s house				175.298305272812

i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m andrea cavalcanti				285.83168889174766
how much in that little bag seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs seven thousand livres cried porthos				16.00636430236215
accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following				4944.424106847953
dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently				34394.862919482424
that proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted i listen to you and i wonder at you sir said the queen				7.69650430310102
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own his life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her				53.82358817383509
the table at which the puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention harrison sat with his back to the king				82.2856934143592
nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed				1852.4269771785464
have you never seen anyone enter your room at night oh yes i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium then you do not know who it is that attempts your life 50073m no said valentine who could desire my death you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening				193136725.87695453
he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on				26.746290429494234
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks				164.96737048984315
during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror starred in every direction				4084.072182197566
and is the reason known no how extraordinary				1608.8593909632339
do you see that said the king				20.15145205570137
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute				11674.941160337465
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent				18991.98464497725
what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede it is not for me to say you are wrong you must advise me what to do do you seriously ask my advice valentine certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it you know my devotion to you valentine said morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain				379.9114002848293
never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope				2044.09556634687
he shuddered and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream				454.6944106613978
and this is all said she and you stopped there oh no said villefort i never ceased to search and to inquire				19049.88677118903
the wall was built of rough stones among which to give strength to the structure blocks of hewn stone were at intervals imbedded				9423.671012358616
they may hear us i don t understand it at all as you execute you will understand and yet i should have preferred you will have the pleasure of the surprise ah that is true hush porthos remained silent and motionless				1472.106734062381
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count s assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him was not that nearly what you said 20222m it was well then did he ask you who is m albert de morcerf				1168.6308657918105
yes raoul replied the count				10.256844433938552
oh i would advance ten millions on his signature				10539.547210959126
the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball				5499.599621664309
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos				101.53477822928306
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs				11281.400584968082
go morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire				1252.6249132739767
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart				51.97923375074106
thanks madame said porthos but i don t like to abuse your kindness besides i must think of my outfit that s true said the procurator s wife groaning that unfortunate outfit alas yes said porthos it is so but of what then does the equipment of your company consist monsieur porthos oh of many things said porthos				12.21745360706463
have i not been there once yes but at that period we were not at war				2658.538732949216
he replied he replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what to poison indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness				1475.5024920903568
this man goes to give his last orders take the least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be gone yes said mme				43.42724161733593
it is not a question of the past but of the present said the queen you said you could give me advice what is it madame said the chancellor hesitating it would be to release broussel the queen although already pale became visibly paler and her face was contracted				20328.998015151785
very rich do you think replied the young man				1.3659173157179616
he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney				6095.146684003252
my friends retire they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered				749.5860651614979
noirtier the redoubtable was the next morning poor m noirtier the helpless old man at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household that is his grandchild valentine a dumb and frozen carcass in fact living painlessly on that time may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay alas sir said monte cristo this spectacle is neither strange to my eye nor my thought				1140.8564928183393
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him				130.30822566186208
it became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of calvinism a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling				7627.883230318139
it must have been the devil who taught it you was it not mordaunt replied by trying his opponent s weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest				12655.721411876078
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one it s true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist				943.168163152211
yes replied porthos coughing				3888.9886924337734
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it				9.466270655878338
can it be otherwise				1232.2460471363197
employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads my dear monsieur de rochefort mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails you				8.393808369376424
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman				1297.2156330237626
this secret which he possessed this woman whom he loved				995.8131949804654
monsieur d artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity				3304.4251608497952
here he said here is a draft at sight and here is your fowl danglars sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had cost				26936.786760990017
i have tried to make you a happy man and you have turned out a murderer oh monsieur said caderousse make one more attempt try me once more i will said the count				9.654113097642316
indeed indeed i did not a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast				352.1012517598048
whether noirtier understood the young man s indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him				5.5469845276558365
waiting for whom bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo				61370.17113519795
two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire furniture				1353.4278656968224
you are coming to sup with me are you not				69.72974602068341
then i went out of the house i proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready				857.7236811531271
oh meddle in nothing which concerns me				9.705696157989982
ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising i have been more than a year absent from paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a provincial				37863.40727758427
we fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by selim				2339.977103184169
i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest				1020.0039307513958
and when did he set out yesterday evening planchet my friend interrupted d artagnan you are really a precious fellow you will understand monsieur i thought there would be still time if you wish to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone				1582.5015939526456
where shall we pass the night he inquired				622.9411530140686
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners				2216.0438003469967
excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth				647.9379509973508
should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession a steel probe to search hearts a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy sir said villefort upon my word you overcome me				5.07023827514161
we have money a little said mazarin trembling lest anne should ask to draw upon his purse				515.2060498381305
courage he whispered to porthos as they proceeded				2173.0179113391455
yes my lord and that worthy monsieur du vallon are we not to enjoy his society certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal and we start in his carriage then yes my lord and with us no other escort but you two is it not enough				516.4686153108504
is that what you would say he has some but he is very avaricious that is his fault				2754.072410617207
indeed madame you believe me too credulous confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this story and create this personage i invent nothing madame i create nothing				367.21786687743037
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines god knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc d angoulême themselves watched over by the cardinal an inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days				411.33981365630376
i know him well there				296.5005360877478
why didn t the baron come himself demanded buckingham				409.0895723791266
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open				202.42664981837908
did you know that i am at liberty i knew it from the fountain head from planchet				787.8706564182255
stir but a step said they and you are a dead man why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence tush tush cried the men keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nîmes				2273.4894669540126
it was the king who was passing through the streets which led from the louvre to the hôtel de ville and which were all illuminated with colored lanterns				9480.60491402808
d artagnan equally moved pressed him also closely to him whilst tears stood in his eyes				12.438553829852495
madame said albert allow me to present to you m maximilian morrel captain of spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest officers i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner				2946.6572914775493
i love retirement and silence because i can live with my thoughts and recollections of past days				896.5263794928223
the door soon opened and the accused appeared				1545.5923850992444
very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent english				2945.7708220867735
when the evening came i was so weak that every time i fainted i thanked god for i thought i was about to die				216.18528180082578
i tell you one of them was saying that if coysel predicted that tis as good as true i know nothing about it but i have heard say that he s not only an astrologer but a magician deuce take it friend if he s one of thy friends thou wilt ruin him in saying so why because he may be tried for it ah				319.66358135675705
now i entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly				12209.822536388907
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc d angoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st martin and the fort of la prée as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle				129.0798486049525
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed				2429.723401711402
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground				4808.258725632503
the young man in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it				80.98730018850722
in fact m bonacieux having left his house at seven o clock in the evening to go to the louvre never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle at the expense of his generous eminence				1983.5959759969192
he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which mordaunt had given in french				1972.5076446845294
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark				9184.168919845015
then with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex eugénie drew on the boots and pantaloons tied her cravat buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure				10565.088296568621
there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man				434.59569433533176
they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier				5287.117944862412
you met him at a dinner party at my house and you introduced yourself at his house that is a totally different affair yes but by my marriage you have forwarded that i not in the least i beg you to believe				1367.7521441690735
you are insane monsieur monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting and d artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to d artagnan to serve him as a safeguard				36655.31009221396
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut i wish we were already there said d artagnan and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our horses come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five o clock in the morning				109.92225152991246
i ask you what year is it the year 1829 returned jacopo				3056.2394177510882
he had read in the countenances of luigi and teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his pocket a purse full of gold which he offered to them				48.192751033800995
madame de villefort emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid then she carefully rinsed the glass and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table				88.95830374949443
it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity				1624.0475994394387
at length after winding about for a minute or two mme				1674.413527771465
and did the eccentric person commit any new originality can he be seen without doing so				24.804160712380607

the world calls me beautiful				1998.8980518361554
madame said the president may reference be made to the count of monte cristo who is now i believe in paris sir replied haydée the count of monte cristo my foster father has been in normandy the last three days who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunes sir replied haydée i have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief				988.4897225534514
i wish i had never seen you cried d artagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason				3760.859503110269
it was to that obedience i owe her portrait d artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended				18611.791270940445
a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain				569.8866758150734
no by your eminence by me				35.12753280237433
the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that château renaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion				1837.0807408434594
the president is speaking to the king stuart bradshaw was saying listen to the roll call of your judges and address to the court any observations you may have to make the king turned his head away as if these words had not been intended for him				12.45351825594155
the count watched him				4.112590337707879
thanks my brave friend cried milady and when shall i be avenged tomorrow immediately when you please milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward d artagnan				1.0688775796943712
you would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that ah depreciate other persons dinners you ministers give such splendid ones yes but we do not invite people of fashion				3159.446707829624

my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry				7446.821697335795
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor				2037.2801497854898
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions				644.1884787046903

as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day d artagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails				1638.289057555985

pardieu if you succeed with him i pronounce you the demon himself he went toward the door and opened it hastily				4057.533419736079

the prisoner s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before la réserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball				2732.9228199878835
besides you forget that i have a ring likewise to which you attach more value it seems than i do to mine at least i have thought so yes for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us from some great embarrassment but even a great danger				2765.4356510443945

my servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a word or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward manner possible				1022.7878468843895
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod				8932.258086553853
do you remember aramis that it was here he received that famous bullet wound by my faith twould be excusable in him to tremble replied aramis for even i feel a shudder at the recollection hold just above that tree is the little spot where i thought i was killed it was soon time for grimaud to recall the past				285.01576611593396
at the same time the count appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black hair was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel				8572.661657726228
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart				55.353535892862006
m de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant				463.5897209426076
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling				2941.575304881867
i do not seek your confidence my dear friend				44.68632814657738
yes your excellency said the captain we have reached it we have reached it repeated the traveller in an accent of indescribable sadness				6527.747988916614
bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet who then went satisfied to his shed				12255.681770623585
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerf s when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort				678.3367076164348
it was one of those events which decide the life of a man it was a choice between the king and the cardinal the choice made it must be persisted in				601.8399296127806
the abbé busoni repeated caderousse fixing his haggard gaze on the count				65.87053414514678
no it does not concern me				5.3157029676479235
my strength is failing me i am dying the voice that implored aid was so piteous that it awakened pity in the heart of athos				337.1961750043562
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer s eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarin s purpose				1222.8309641723506
a priest can understand a father s grief and m de villefort giving the key to d avrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work				341.998857336288
villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him				3.033893658469798
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest				571.6947276210514

monte cristo opened the carriage door morrel sprang out on the pavement bertuccio was waiting on the steps				826.3056337099223
in the chamber of d artagnan and porthos the two soldiers had been found bound and gagged				14613.383552201296
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple				2639.242600021997
grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so				87.97877603271564
milady perceived a bed she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only refresh her head and her ideas but still further her complexion				1790.0414394047264
he was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him				3.0049974175513916
happen what will the devil take them they can t eat us and he mounted his horse				158.8133277382481
still further in buckingham s lodging which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs strongly compromised mme				118.95504531131351
as things are turning out i foresee that we must give battle to london to the provinces to all england and certainly in the end we can t fail to be beaten we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said athos				5.367394284238657
but at the very moment when d artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it m de tréville was highly astonished to see his protégé make a sudden spring become crimson with passion and rush from the cabinet crying s blood he shall not escape me this time and who asked m de tréville				3.0283655376103438
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear				1414.6665976687298
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret they will not be strangers they will be friends ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp i do and i will tell you why				71122.30885834945
the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and re entered the hotel				286.10359070468206
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said good night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier				4097.195580572501
she was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of sleep				566.9256014528439
the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the rue richelieu then they gained the private staircase and d artagnan was ushered into the oratory				26548.929081452403
i have a father who is seventy if he yet lives i only love him and a young girl called mercédès				214.95455954054177
it was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by athos aramis and even the englishman				507.91022931586133
take some she said				4.8103032644975166
it was three o clock when he threw himself on the bed				900.1236979484281
hurry up there you rascal we are mad with hunger and thirst bazin entered at that moment carrying a bottle in each hand				179.41217663360723
yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable				62333.99501274739
oh sir exclaimed raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix spare him				1288.8224377172203
morrel looked attentively on villefort				79.9824954700357
will you accompany me to the harbor maximilian 50233m i am entirely yours count morrel accompanied the count to the harbor				11391.295408963806
you know that the english laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage				7172.426538695748
then an idea came to him which harmonized everything				990.4184750115498
she told d artagnan that lord de winter was her brother in law and not her brother				330.5457281965397
it is not true said milady in a tone of voice so firm and with a countenance so unchanged that if d artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have doubted				2939.899612720221
courage my friend but above all prudence and think what you owe to the queen to her and to you cried d artagnan				1.019171237366252
never did funeral knell never did alarm bell produce a greater effect on the hearer				161062.18669328876
noirtier resumed m d avrigny in the same pitiless tone m				1309.4399590654896
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other that s exactly the reason i won t go said d artagnan				1.011952161381264
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting of course of course said the prisoners anyone can see he s a gentleman well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade 50151m i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper				5185.726160677477
i descended the staircase step by step the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees				233.8069808559542
our blow has failed for to night let us withdraw				1005.1603451643891
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow				119.49444467338694
but you continued m bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days				820.4270840757246
it was about one of those purchases that interest women a purchase by which much might have been gained but the more the young woman excused herself the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him				3.0824542182062764
and with how many fingers does he bless				32584.873931555798
great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us ah monsieur stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i have had how sirrah				146577.76058413414
how had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized				24335.08036856207
one day when contrary to his custom he had admitted mercédès and the poor girl in spite of her own grief and despair endeavored to console him he said to her be assured my dear daughter he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of course shall see him first however well disposed a person may be why you see we leave off after a time seeing persons who are in sorrow they make one melancholy and so at last old dantès was left all to himself and i only saw from time to time strangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence				69682.05565731274
i was about to become an abbé and all was arranged				5661.365318059908
franz remained with m de villefort at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait he saw franz and m de villefort get into the same mourning coach and thought this meeting forboded evil				3769.1645466000823
this letter as he spoke maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry monte cristo opened the letter and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight				715.5533940416001
and you as for me i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home				59.80556910104521
how will you have them protect you				3.6895779346464366
i the offspring of a noble family who placed reliance upon your friendship i was near dying of my wounds at first and of hunger afterward in a beggarly inn at chantilly without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to you but monsieur porthos murmured the procurator s wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was wrong				664.5855595313742
unfasten it or i will break it in said grimaud				88.00722378157573
i will ask the cardinal it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fête yes madame replied the astonished king but why do you ask that it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs that is to say madame it was he sire it was he well and what does it signify whether it was he or i				634.7188979321551
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow				5498.414418510957
for instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea time ma foi i should like to smoke monte cristo took the gong and struck it once				2107.8832455998704
he lodges at the hôtel des princes				11051.609413320206
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed				353.8894935366083
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants				9117.452118650945
do not refuse this little service				1438.0383320056692
yes said albert but this has nothing to do with the existence of the count of monte cristo pardieu everyone exists doubtless but not in the same way everyone has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress horses that cost six thousand francs apiece and greek mistresses have you seen the greek mistress i have both seen and heard her				17.95313821774205
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and d artagnan and advanced toward the door				13.277625332417086
the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner				145.72967280133722
mother said the young man looking alternately at madame morrel and her daughter what has occurred what has happened				371.4942542459048
when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan				41298.60115683888
it was true and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth				12695.831228176194
yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices				24322.3658490993
do you know what consoled him				12.486570080477954
for master broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people				564.6790167332593
but lord de winter might suspect him felton himself might now be watched				3182.153154413747
in spite of his repugnance to address the guards dantès turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand comrade said he i adjure you as a christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going				879.8897366337367
he went then to the queen and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her				16.70575815895706

nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years				1328.742109476543
and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence continued the mercer with a trifling alteration in his voice so trifling indeed that d artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man				72.24848174532507
god he murmured not knowing what he said god god behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the hand of god				1277.9027789498705

well upon my honor said athos your eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several ill looking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces a quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know i don t like quarrelers and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in fault what have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his brow				1633.6436274566925
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis				16.59177798301002
depart then depart i implore you oh how beautiful you are thus				561.048994070558
as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the café de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted				1772.3430661877535
what are the wishes of his eminence he wishes to have you in his service and who spoke to him of me rochefort you remember him yes pardieu				1706.762747993701

on perceiving the count he rose quickly				1153.4803204310585
two methods of self destruction were at his disposal				1270.3630568077351
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags				1893.2903671604695
debray is with madame danglars nodded his head then turning to monte cristo said m				616.1051014438765

grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything				322.2200506486145
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of god s mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my father s tomb by your father s tomb said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of death				214.2801557666932
a sublime action at all events for mousqueton looked upon himself as dead				789.2999337839752

lord de winter perceived nothing of this				195.48396645360094
ah this time cried d artagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the apartment				229.73727616397073

luigi vampa comes to take us and we take him we bring him back to rome and present him to his holiness the pope who asks how he can repay so great a service then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses and we see the carnival in the carriage and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol and proclaim us like curtius and horatius cocles the preservers of their country whilst albert proposed this scheme signor pastrini s face assumed an expression impossible to describe				6282.788748502298
franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible				1864.4896439334834
as to d artagnan he took care not to give the least sign of existence				1051.0443400332035
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme				57.47434490303361
your majesty is well aware that there is a truce between us and the english army and if there is a truce the english army has broken it by quitting the town contrary to the agreement which kept it there				592.3968299078259

the island of tiboulen dantès although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower				64995.92713091092
i own i was seeking them why when all was arranged listen count the affair is serious and unavoidable did you doubt it no the offence was public and everyone is already talking of it well well i hoped to get an exchange of arms to substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is blind have you succeeded asked monte cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hope				1833.3965290846377
god has sent you to me to console at one and the same time the man who could not be a father and the prisoner who could not get free and faria extended the arm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw himself upon his neck and wept				2802.6525595773355
i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are terrible you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say				310.2652917933448
though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean				9489.433437709045
at length the light disappeared				140.08331842092156
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm				26227.540853059607

no no he said to the patron i was awkward and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness				15886.446258967548

if you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing it would be unpardonable the procurator s wife was piqued				2648.847202792863

you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude				35757.73419507355
but d artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m bazin and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friend s valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five				3400.259583112171
bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions				744.7996906891585
we will accompany them only to a little village in limousin lying between tulle and angouleme a little village called roche l abeille madame de chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile				947.4589462131224
and what he continued has been done with the poor body by order of cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it				14.509297736381761
barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes				61.59740689941759

come then and take it friend said the gascon				33.27628243205657
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over				148.73210295023787
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone				21.765908498456337
i have but one word to add and that is to propose an example to you not mine for i myself have never appeared at court and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer i speak of monsieur de tréville who was formerly my neighbor and who had the honor to be as a child the play fellow of our king louis xiii whom god preserve				29099.096657296006
you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions				9706.208500585319
when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation				2282.9525648772633
he causes a disturbance in your hostelry which respectable people can not put up with				939.912746741035

if you make a single step to find her you are lost that s pretty positive continued d artagnan but after all it is but a menace yes but that menace terrifies me				4.811008065079621
grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring				6657.016848575491
milady de boulogne evening of the twenty fifth				2808.443848841739
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris				66.09095721143079
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o clock				1.102833870332491
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound				1888.7250483975754

yes and as i am just now excessively annoyed i shall go from home				208.67327844344936
on the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every kind of civility thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own				508.59318080881894
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into reverie				12675.434068564256
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her				17.522642808610275

oh you may speak before his excellency said he he is one of my friends				42.18644861936522

albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up				96.87111890454987
albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered				21532.768314616307

it is well said he kissing it it is my master s ring and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it				13.114009891404756
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do				953.5554181316655

apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that i should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether i am as he says too old for action and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make d artagnan shudder but d artagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said go demon do what thou wilt				14323.466206080826

d artagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind				2701.7904965969924

athos has been arrested yesterday at saint germain as he came out from the presence of the queen the arms of d artagnan fell powerless by his side				96.54909834306436

they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m de tréville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions				18383.40026269514
i have the purse still by me a large one made of red silk and asked the abbé is m morrel still alive yes replied caderousse				23.951772233535195
it is impossible to say whether charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of d artagnan s voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself				16.381428754507397
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment				338.3840715381974
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before				45.00587219468513

you have decidedly some genius at your control ma foi spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf				29.98449881605942

you he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about d artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it				19.72501404878703
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly				5608.508080275151

our readers already know how he was recognized by d artagnan and how that recognition by inspiring fear in the four musketeers had given fresh activity to their journey				866.7680952607552
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken				2450.8721474635745

but the lady asked porthos				19.280891958967214
grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word pointed true said la ramee				6.392995342699355

and all this all this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman s voice				140.62689502000111
this contest at length exhausted jussac s patience				12452.147778617014

a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in				812.6749475521896
the first row seeing their sergeant stop stopped in their turn and so on to the very last				3860.7709461371255

the third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows then returned and the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of these preparations and then dragged assunta feet foremost towards the brazier expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed treasure was secreted				11992.610827464649

i hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men ah				136.41885916737297
ah said the marquise de saint méran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed am i not right villefort i beg your pardon madame				685.6098426581548

your note of this morning has completely bewildered me				23.2388762838464
no time was to be lost				135.20964450006173
a summer ball the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the procureur a travelling carriage entered the rue du helder passed through the gateway of no				698.858973325898
i had been tracked by a customs officer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile				6584.783318849941
fire fire cried mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends				73.3353671848249
this enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table				130.8599134438457
sire said villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and i have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servant that s all				132.13698245896975
here cried porthos here porthos foresaw that if d artagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed				1391.762310958963
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity				1530.554653820446
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first				9442.977105922584
yes count said milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met				14571.495112803657

albert kissed his mother s hand and drew near the count				48.87364809897495
then walking towards morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor				24732.26140304939
do you not see that i reserve eighty francs for myself				100.79152507973421

but continued aramis the details escape me and me also said porthos				13.11128063304089
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter				301.64488564226684
it is impossible that your majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my brother the king attacked in a manner so direct did not know what to answer and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête				11911.659385666913
that madame is an official secret but if you have any commissions for paris a friend of mine is going there tonight and will with pleasure undertake them the guests looked at each other				112.31016367625011
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms				927.3063389403001
no no said fernand restraining him stay				2491.949982332192
you have a park and horses servants athos smiled				16.573990433776522
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight				5123.966630976753
gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the illustrious coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to pistache let us go on to another of his exercises gentlemen there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them do you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs				5206.787162052861
as to the left hand one he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the minister of the interior				17577.768350161004

it may be remembered that he had the saddle which came from buckingham				295.7020951901239
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur				2667.321821647507
the night was extremely dark				385.1229894965405
i knew very well that he was incapable of defending me but as he could serve us in other ways i wished to inform him of what oh that is not my secret i must not therefore tell you besides said d artagnan pardon me madame if guardsman as i am i remind you of prudence besides i believe we are not here in a very proper place for imparting confidences				40932.53099203113
midnight sounded and almost at the same time the bell was rung in milady s chamber				102.53842222814846
you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the world and be deemed unlikely and unnatural				20894.969551187784
and you say that monsieur d artagnan was one of those four men he led the enterprise and who were the others i leave it to monsieur d artagnan to name them my lord				58.15898880410511
if he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy he would be stifled and then so much the better all would be over				200.8135262057586
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the wall				174.44502511027176
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions				7031.258014835706
hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered				59.02133443793987
but d artagnan remained impassible				5855.784198143792
i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home be easy				451.9974544208756
the people were shouting and running about with torches				6013.1156442289475
from that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly awakened our curiosity				1681.5049214676235
the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind				512.8821154515251
i do sometimes soldier though i am monte cristo advanced into the room maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed him				3.3949942902601404
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open d artagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid				3966.8457927228264
the man carried me to the foundling asylum where i was registered under the number 37				63097.465097367975
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman chatillon and flamarens started				77.05192620364717
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me				144.6778745145044
d artagnan desired planchet to be summoned but he had disappeared				43.10397116990874
i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle oh heavens cried athos				6.0923478861936395
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free				5818.958937164226
franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows				586.5813995609856
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival				9915.057925223076
the porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the count s approach				3734.226647258811
monte cristo bent his head				31.524593710814607
mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help said d avrigny since she is dead dead dead groaned forth villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man				2750.3466331631253
but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover				3408.197333747041
full then of this conviction he pulled his cap down over his eyes and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip				7210.565706676498
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction				1404.6672665030428
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that d artagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind				66.71430688611912
years of suffering in my opinion count double and i have suffered for twenty years ah yes i understand said mazarin want of fortune perhaps				1673.4931995455274

there said he there is the work complete				10719.946567049135
i am happy to see m beauchamp that you are more sober than he was sir said m beauchamp albert was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own account to apologize for him				11.480385525483868
there remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain				6960.769789283637
albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling				2066.7385699464753
are you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added danglars				76.79326225208627
and follow me wherever i go to the world s end then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god				2293.639214777503
it is magnificent continued beauchamp to be able to exercise so much self control assuredly as for me i should have been incapable of it said château renaud with most significant coolness				2138.049554109919
he therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill received				1966.9154631380793

you are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her friend				221.47190338198953
the young girl hastily took the letter from him				23.039510905182293
there he stopped breathless and panting				5608.053460042376
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever				2867.7901661481146
we will discuss that subject at length some future time said he				9.553740330350312
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the count s safety became now quite a secondary matter				1068.363323282618
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i and eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti danglars kept up the title of prince				4133.956127420972

in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness				6343.506908241973
my political opinions replied dantès				62.087152618597656
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so much				488.7320687306493
it was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle				173.2043915323004
peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly				1922.2683059635945
there he is attending mass in the chapel of the virgin d artagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end				298.30467060772713
no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited				1505.5213531520515
i can not reconcile myself to this idea it would madden me				548.0632841626463
i will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account and which you will deliver into the proper hands and whither am i to go to london i go to london				392.2277891568338
nothing but one word said d artagnan				1.0171385994199091
it begins to develop itself said d artagnan				1.018838166681052
and why in this solemn drawing room when the study is so comfortable i quite understand why you ask sir said eugénie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation				558.5712770544344

you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and sisteron advancing he is advancing said louis xviii				180.11317364973553
well then madame not a day passes in which i do not suffer affronts from your princes and your lordly servants all of them automata who do not perceive that i wind up the spring that makes them move nor do they see that beneath my quiet demeanor lies the still scorn of an injured irritated man who has sworn to himself to master them one of these days				494.6199604364472
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak				241.6804838252466
it was illuminated by lamps with ground glass shades which gave only a feeble light as if out of consideration for the envoy s weak sight				1255.7526808411442
be on the qui vive cried d artagnan				1.015970587178197
d artagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party				7419.0556727719595
albert went to his room and dressed with unusual care				1251.4929478415038

i was not deceived said he here is monsieur d artagnan and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and aramis the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment				27.003696870766788

bonacieux and dwelt for an instant on the lips of d artagnan				1.0667655460125438
your hand for perhaps we shall not see each other again athos put his arm around aramis s neck and embraced him				3.8491376285704066
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips				2201.61850169363
m noirtier who on the previous night was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the dagger m				469.93911765727586
oh no your excellency he is not the devil replied the host with a grin of contempt for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns which however did not prevent his saying as he was fainting that if such a thing had happened in paris you should have cause to repent of it at a later period then said the stranger coolly he must be some prince in disguise i have told you this good sir resumed the host in order that you may be on your guard did he name no one in his passion yes he struck his pocket and said we shall see what monsieur de tréville will think of this insult offered to his protégé monsieur de tréville said the stranger becoming attentive he put his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of monsieur de tréville				7.425313988792674

luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you and what has became of him oh i don t know he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest				241.64395479760537
to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when d artagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure				2567.95312310436
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself come come enough of such compliments cried porthos				11.327335939034032

i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility				861.0351418538696
the more we have ventured the more we gain when we know how to wait yes but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners bah said athos				6.7734357294295435
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion				1513.4114503033168

this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast				4716.3559352842185
determined to put the advice of m de tréville in practice instantly d artagnan directed his course toward the rue des fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his valise				24567.26046277036
franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent				5895.315761651885

the rendezvous the first words that albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged				7023.122211761228
i come to say that today and for the remainder of the carnival i leave the carriage entirely at your disposal				4757.364836883087
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination				1170.297105433894
it had now become a weary and almost hopeless task and had it not been for the threefold motives of honor friendship and gratitude implanted in their hearts our two travelers would have given up many a time their rides over the sand their interrogatories of the peasantry and their close inspection of faces				7645.012095916037
oh oh said m de tréville				4.04871035422528
beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative				13449.865131809878
can he be afraid of this boy but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short he bowed humbly and retired				731.1424471329328
his resolution not to sign lasted two days after which he offered a million for some food				4703.28528596497
your interview will be private				37803.87368734847

i wish i were on board already and he looked back again				37.6052392718906
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his feet				132.31352219071618
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket yes said d artagnan athos is right it must be burned				12310.797035924865

if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years old				76.29094045565971
two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea				204.89709106180615
d artagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had not whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subject been able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence				8300.386743534085
until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods				2263.5452917706184
d artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error				2349.792017228538
am i to put this construction on your visit yes if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny wait a moment no threats if you please m fernand mondego vicomte de morcerf i never allow them from my enemies and therefore shall not put up with them from my friends				84.24121990801355
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered				1083.312400263458
for in truth i think i have hitherto been deceived in you				16.61679344721772

are you asleep that you don t answer when i ring and d artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently				2729.077299089395
come continued d artagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice				876.2805165416137
oh sir exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time				416.4726420429161

you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault at these words he retired				835.1931706248818
the councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame				31.58038956383094
the queen walked first every one followed her				17.672643171681198
but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel son				2192.1611563287106
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors				4829.356968855346
then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child				835.5939073784028
the prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust				4862.172562668315
as for planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush the poor lad s strength was almost exhausted				2108.1415765119664
as a further precaution they had bound his hands				51.6420208729791
she was poisoned on my account that s all you know of him asked mazarin				38.44911284707213

sir cried parry may you and yours be blessed how can it be repeated the king				24.189924718847198
when he saw the formidable and chosen body with which louis xiii				55.6595002312075
he returned to france with the epaulet of sub lieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a captain in 1823 during the spanish war that is to say at the time when danglars made his early speculations				62849.193721159805
your holiness said gondy my friend you take me for some one else no your holiness i take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor i recognized you at the first glance gondy smiled				487.7877492089975
as for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite				10688.280635180496
friend d artagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future				262.8833996542005
mesdemoiselles noblet julia and leroux executed the customary pirouettes robert duly challenged the prince of granada and the royal father of the princess isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle				26039.051642268925
why they want to know if the duke of buckingham is in paris and if he has had or is likely to have an interview with the queen d artagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in probability				18754.652966270118
i do not understand you so much the better i have a ray of hope left listen i am all attention said eugénie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze				6345.340213911404

caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories but also cross the court				302.7657152877113
you are welcome monsieur said milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill humor which d artagnan had just remarked you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail				26354.58606420191
you are the king s servant and must go wherever that service calls you oh villefort cried renée clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly to give you pleasure my sweet renée i promise to show all the lenity in my power but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off renée shuddered at the word cut for the growth in question had a head				483.92229345255834

he had learned that dantès had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done				235.3574321955868
i wish to thank them all at once				100.59653762363203

apropos said d artagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain yes in some respects tolerably well olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent				8069.384137025636
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh				210.56519949697173
m de tréville listened to the young man s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair				551.3213481881797
all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar				10764.859502595567

as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte				70.54645029591794
yes as you see neighbor caderousse and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every way replied dantès but ill concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility				7454.154406694998
at the same time he felt the duke s arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone hush smiling as he uttered the word				483.46077865047914

now jump down athos athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall				112.92562238386674
he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe				22893.047111713502
the diamond which glittered in the window at marlé s or fossin s shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure worldling murmured the count				6.1858139117676165
morrel did not turn round he expected these words of cocles the agent of thomson french he placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth				1069.1180634736545

well said franz to albert do you know what is the best thing we can do				136.3890046768533
what shall i say to the cardinal you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay and of surrendering only to fifty men				587.7786331807491

a complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour good my friend said d artagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing i do not think it i am certain of it quick quick d artagnan				1.142285710133102
morrel attributed penelon s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the pharaon longer				2099.6663888238622
danglars left last night left m				305.3238697347784

d artagnan did not draw his sword porthos put his back into the sheath				30979.69724440237
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawing room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by signs				6694.9623966621
no violence violence is the proof of weakness				3774.70782874564

then said d artagnan let us give the money to the lackeys as lord de winter desired us to do yes said athos let us give the money to the lackeys not to our lackeys but to the lackeys of the englishmen athos took the purse and threw it into the hand of the coachman				669.023908739547
then wait said aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock				1135.6070125715771
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardes he whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governor s country house so it is said d artagnan i know him now				250.71642254143543

i lost madame du vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in affliction on that account				857.9977512610496
i had informed m morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last half hour to tell me that if his ship the pharaon did not come into port on the 15th he would be wholly unable to make this payment but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment it looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed m de boville despairingly				275643.61265735526
i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word				146.9614751792351
i remained in the room and waited oh heaven 30271m when daylight dawned i went down again				89.87349517399574

plan of campaign d artagnan went straight to m de tréville s				7.350810514357667
and why asked scarron is he not a man of good birth certainly agreeable undeniably witty he has unfortunately too much wit well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man because he is an enemy of whom of the cardinal what answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man				304.9038412572498
it was only a precaution				1576.9281789971528
i pardieu and you would arrest him why not you would arrest the duc de beaufort armed in the field if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in so would i said porthos				12.888245062520598
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple				1883.6703719662319
you had friends albert break off their acquaintance				1450.7399640332255
unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself				2752.8014837041696
the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an ill bred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it				23.27919122836937
madame danglars is ill said villefort it would be better to take her to her carriage oh mon dieu said monte cristo and i have forgotten my smelling bottle i have mine said madame de villefort and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward				2708.0757506848327
cama the pilot of the saint ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales do you know observed franz that with such stories you make me think of ali baba s enchanted cavern i tell you what i have been told then you advise me to accept oh i don t say that your excellency will do as you please i should be sorry to advise you in the matter franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted				707.1319683135793
france has already received queen henrietta and unintentionally doubtless has maintained a centre of inextinguishable civil war in my country				1093.440709301439
at last the half hour struck				2681.870943644376
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornélie				7992.61134393861
then all is agreed said she				50.02456624898827
seven o clock said grimaud who had not spoken a word				47.42192175973349
in short i see you to tell you that we must never see each other again speak on madame speak on queen said buckingham the sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words				650.2019461010836
the papers said something about it did they not then you believe the papers i not the least in the world only i fancied that the honest messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches well that s what puzzles me replied danglars the news of the return of don carlos was brought by telegraph so that said monte cristo you have lost nearly 1 700 000 francs this month not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss diable said monte cristo compassionately it is a hard blow for a third rate fortune third rate said danglars rather humble what do you mean by that certainly continued monte cristo i make three assortments in fortune first rate second rate and third rate fortunes				12398.007601705882
are you satisfied my lord he asked				12.892818195718132
the carmelite convent at béthune chapter lxii				8505.356526994605
sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away				327.1249902131749
and as continued he the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family we mean to make the journey together				586.7472873713863
and i too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes				146.82789966844015
i must have left it in my room she said				6.087103610136635
albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble but i thought this mark of consideration due to you				18.263057164250267
but no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of d artagnan and of athos it must be the best but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison egad cried d artagnan he s just the man i count upon				1064.5910076064754
morrel s clear eye was for the moment clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large tear rolled down his cheek				8011.086368615127
you re welcome sirs				2197.5028850656167
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow				4248.286206478269
albert gathered up his papers hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord and offering his arm to his mother they descended the stairs				313.1323361129003
something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more melancholy				2588.718358659713
they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in				1087.4740615437495
that horse was to have identified us in the day of battle				342.2817511149591
well said d artagnan one is never killed in a first engagement nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killed well he will die bravely but hold should such a misfortune happen well athos passed his hand across his pale brow				106.21211454191585
to be named the just you are right tréville but they were not alone your musketeers				1163.4899046893001
the fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then does it not asked caderousse				29.867329737126052
ah said he involuntarily following noirtier s eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed				1173.5639651908277
it was at the brigantine that had left in the morning and the tartan that had just set sail that edmond fixed his eyes				55.64331286960643
you know her it seems said château renaud				1.0328427542997443
at beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for porthos				134.55316762382358
younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names				16559.480394329614
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly				2551.5898933613435
although about forty four or forty five years old she might have passed for thirty five				2940.418344228101
this answer and especially the tone in which it was uttered chilled the heart of poor morrel				2417.1691084431227
at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle				32603.275737232667
i feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will he must be a prophet then said valentine smiling				16.709502563862852
after having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his souvenirs auteuil rue de la fontaine no				26.682076612713793
the name of d artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year 1634 or 1635 that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty				5357.241782549469
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and one nights				4522.5143357894
albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departed not however without walking several times to the door of the press room as if he had half a mind to enter				382.5474447058006
you know how difficult it is to discover the truth and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes louis xiii				38.74953661100771
here it is i see at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raoul s horse waving his parti colored cap and crying broussel				1305.4761015151569
he resolved then to defend the door bravely and as betrayed by the mistress of the inn he could not say that aramis was absent he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference which had commenced with the morning and would not as bazin said terminate before night				688.5394405781634
because an astrologer had predicted that you would escape ah				393.98379393454235
we must play the farce to the end				488.2629401704163
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerf s adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known				726.6117258951737
at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright				9534.845195155687
come come continued the count i see you are still the same an assassin reverend sir since you know everything you know it was not i it was la carconte that was proved at the trial since i was only condemned to the galleys is your time then expired since i find you in a fair way to return there no reverend sir i have been liberated by someone that someone has done society a great kindness ah said caderousse i had promised and you are breaking your promise interrupted monte cristo				69.47889682524232
questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own				120.56489643330526
athos replaced his in his belt porthos and aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabbards				26900.51276048246
then i saw no more but i heard the noise of breaking furniture				2397.298641735174
in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds				4074.719628390512
the king s authority will put all this to rights was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion yes said the queen it is requested the coadjutor bowed				1743.1922190296023
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles				2627.630971249522
the first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the baron danglars rue de la chaussée d antin no				26.313189474543044
can you recollect all that perfectly madame come at dinnertime very well and be upon your guard before my husband who is rather shrewd notwithstanding his seventy six years seventy six years				907.2600252846934
athos on quitting aramis went to madame de chevreuse				25.133681317833886
and now gentlemen i repeat excuse me but on that account only and on guard at these words with the most gallant air possible d artagnan drew his sword				104.99863534544703
and yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens				1591.6616274119024
yes my lord replied the servant m				47.50833505271401
young people stop there said the tutor joining in the conversation				104.17740632136147
now barring all that i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine ah well exclaimed château renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more				848.0228015993491
there is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth oh go on monsieur go on said madame de chevreuse eagerly you can t imagine how much this conversation interests me you encourage me said athos i will continue then				156.5404880055761
eugénie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her turn				103.89295514438844
heyday cried d artagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken				117.43957862979259
monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time pistache s patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth				1271.149571873576
it might be called a magnificent prison				1321.9704678694295
danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his pillow				12295.004473304833
this advice appeared good to the future chancellor				10424.300549747191
cloud and not elsewhere before the d estrées s pavilion and not in another street				595.145755681915
so you have seen the arm that was all				325.62023937851825
d artagnan and athos refused them				65.44739940582758
well mercédès beloved by you i would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and i should become rich				963.8787231202303
near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal then i must wait here or in the neighborhood only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal let me know always where to find you observe it is probable that i may not be able to remain here why you forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute that s true but is this little woman then to escape his eminence bah said milady with a smile that belonged only to herself you forget that i am her best friend ah that s true				242.874567724428
whatever you say sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house and do not do such things no the commission i ask is quite different name it sir i beg you are the inspector of prisons i have been so these fourteen years you keep the registers of entries and departures i do to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners there are special reports on every prisoner well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared suddenly				1575.4543178688416
the initials are only mine c				25931.153907698947
you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss				9407.292767351466
it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of yes it was i so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth condescend to listen to me and you shall know all i listen i had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or musketeers				1795.2702774247891
she seems to have been taken suddenly ill very probably answered the count				9.401462201786263
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his father s abode				7063.3566721427605
let us break the carriage cried the people				1239.3296371554707
i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death				410.8105707279855
there is an excellent tavern at compiègne well remembered by those who have ever been there				1042.873501827808
her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels				1175.2742252401395
and the other asked athos				6.550697660608085
the marriage feast the morning s sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby tinted light				1636.0243715096149

no no continued danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose and danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to fernand and which fernand read in an undertone the honorable the king s attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris				70.58450645689689

during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentine s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted				274.0045945211241

i am no swordsman well don t be alarmed if i return at one two or three o clock in the morning indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all this time bonacieux became so pale that d artagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter				132.69584320452526

an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor				7265.857639324377
the contract shall not be signed cried morrel				14.23051487308318

nachrichter as say our neighbors the germans and as he bound her while saying these words milady uttered two or three savage cries which produced a strange and melancholy effect in flying away into the night and losing themselves in the depths of the woods				9591.792126298886

oh the wretched hours i have endured the torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away sir said valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it yes valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror				124.57094024157036
by the latter i mean your relatives and friends				946.2877439616877
my first impressions were favorable to the minister i said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved d artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim				34748.86190805832
d artagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville the other was a convent of jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers				9106.850289870641

ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners i had ennui and i amused myself with twisting that rope felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived a gilt headed screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons				2588.113574734699
he took from the duke all the steel knives and silver forks and replaced them with silver knives and wooden forks pretending that as he had been informed that the duke was to pass all his life at vincennes he was afraid of his prisoner attempting suicide				4339.647326996744

he smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this purpose				859.1973259122166
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly				8757.078688491392
your history is a terrible one mr mordaunt and touches me keenly but happily for you you serve an all powerful master he ought to aid you in your search we have so many means of gaining information my lord to a well bred dog it is only necessary to show one end of a track he is certain to reach the other but this relation you mentioned do you wish me to speak to him said mazarin who was anxious to make a friend about cromwell s person				425.6163367232393

yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows				8684.026391325518
you are right it is not you who should apprise m danglars it is i do not do so reverend sir why not because you would bring us to ruin and you think that to save such villains as you i will become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their crimes reverend sir said caderousse drawing still nearer				384.92672734446984

yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house				278.5239922568747

every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile instead of vincennes				2365.38892718745
suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead				207.4453547227554
it was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action from all sides				1811.839820650703
a small low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one half per cent it had originally paid				18895.709749849648
the horses excited by pain and emulation raced over the dark road in the midst of which was now seen a moving mass denser and more obscure than the rest of the horizon				1202.9735249641774
his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same				434.4771741523185
in addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble of a commode were covered with empty bottles				1242.5178149118199
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another				726.0534220375681
and now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and sister my father said the young man bending his knee bless me morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said oh yes yes i bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me the edifice which misfortune has destroyed providence may build up again on seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you				10.844462645108983

the concert must be a delightful one they suit each other remarkably well said danglars				30.126811867250222
athos was then sent to the cardinal but unfortunately the cardinal was at the louvre with the king				82.40175940049687
when franz had once again set foot on shore he forgot for the moment at least the events which had just passed while he finished his affairs of pleasure at florence and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin his companion who was awaiting him at rome				222.92599325430413

he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast off cloaks for mousqueton and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master				227.31338424387283
still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of l aiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles roberges and feluccas				11193.682754749756

the meeting chapter 91				3897.970705387214
0165m mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the sea that had never seemed so vast				7379.813729480272

athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinal s				25.487321034952814
he was a stout man of about two or three and twenty with an open ingenuous countenance a black mild eye and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach				35470.22931388974
he was masked likewise but i knew his step i knew his voice i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity				2840.0209167103685
my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when i hear it tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it what do you mean sir inquired raoul				51.069477415850365
in six hours they reached compiegne and alighted at the peacock				1632.2537362036533
my dear fellow be a musketeer or an abbé				1463.0855841801745
raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit				30749.547627591466
henceforth we have nothing to fear				757.2922922215939
franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion				871.944042359783
know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this world s affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east				819.1667916376397
the king has nothing like it no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin				142.73121543174835
then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse				3284.7189171241216
pray tell me how it happened willingly				3026.1027845337085
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while d artagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table				86.65833389049706
well said he on perceiving d artagnan				1.0178543329389411

then said albert you became the property of this man 40080m no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople				33194.74015399524
the old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes and paced up and down his chamber the whole day and would not go to bed at all for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night and for myself i assure you i could not sleep either for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast				289.2070501333679
a moment later the gray headed man was beside him				3.1263396990334664
one hour s rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man s bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence seemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future				438.7670521718482
the star of day pale but nevertheless still splendid was setting in the horizon glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration				31266.505640678253

at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely albert s mask fell off				592.9035274221775
hush he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee the sergeant began to laugh				602.7227518927033
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry				15033.413179683457
the good captain leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of m morrel i shall have his place				661.9245123652511

grimaud gave a grim smile				42.524599967719155
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray				17247.46896132671
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bed head but his mother				261.19794507417475
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon for you see the bright side of everything what would you have said d artagnan				1.025863171251694

signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear when villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said d épinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club that i may at least know who killed my father villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather s answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few steps				2028.2085979756166

pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague is in fact unlimited said monte cristo				1.0122724767473104

my mind was already made up				113.54656536578605
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of spain				816.4764067135236
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only half aroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake				3359.216250333778
and now prisoner will you consent to tell your name said the president				65.66549848611584

everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack				1201.390795402928
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued				5841.366016728361
the marquis de saint méran i think the concierge said				191.79000739637644

he wished to show albert the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peter s by daylight				7143.5032598746175
a light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles and from tunis to venice				1371.3896990763922
all at once he started				377.9842772197108
sir she said to morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer				43403.98688547233
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawing room with her little edward				1234.533268570342
charles stuart you are our prisoner and both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other stunned				10664.597671534804
haydée said he did you read it oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour				572.619879920151

oh do something for me the doctor flew to his patient				1727.936677682691
let us sit down and chat quietly as brother and sister ought to do then turning toward the door and seeing that the young officer was waiting for his last orders he said				30.56479690951818
porthos made a thousand flourishes asking bicarat what o clock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brother s having just obtained a company in the regiment of navarre but jest as he might he gained nothing				1006.5661491774334
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon				785.0984740075498
yes count returned the notary				86.27246375588268

and the commencement of the reign of king louis xiv it may be easily imagined how great was our joy when in turning over this manuscript our last hope we found at the twentieth page the name of athos at the twenty seventh the name of porthos and at the thirty first the name of aramis				48.59386256004799
do you know what has become of athos asked d artagnan of planchet as they galloped on				39.18071875257615
you to be sure said d artagnan pressing athos s hand				11.296808521882417
now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast				2065.4893365037506
yes my lord and from pure devotion to the cause for monsieur de bracieux is rich rich said mazarin whom that single word always inspired with a great respect				3934.009138497526
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian				127.31294842858398
one however fell at the duke s feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket				101.90802026849333
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as d artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time				179.41713862498497
it is a charming place well supplied with spring water and fine trees a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long time without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old things are so much sought after				3034.4545872247436
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding light without warmth				34282.341431769004
yes if you really wish it said d artagnan and even with great pleasure i confess the journey has given me a devil of an appetite ah my poor friend said aramis you will find meagre fare you were not expected am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit fathers				129258.8494849615
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play				1921.274958603454
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords				12787.708310806986
well then i should say for instance resumed danglars that if after a voyage such as dantès has just made in which he touched at the island of elba someone were to denounce him to the king s procureur as a bonapartist agent i will denounce him exclaimed the young man hastily				174.67925600523176
now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand				193.013505348088
by the light of one of these torches d artagnan perceived men in uniform				5451.272336839456
as to haydée these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a moment for she ceased speaking her head leaning on her hand like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue waters of the lake of yanina which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched				33136.76361464753
haydée had taken away ali and bertuccio remained with noirtier				145.58270754928913
he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared but at two o clock she had not returned				1131.8902981774418
d artagnan translated this for the others				1237.2470785194432
a man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly				829.4930283012174
they proposed a game of bouillotte				10422.113673873448
of bethune not been there i would have cut off the head of that infamous being without thinking of it or even after thinking of it				6.32608763685011
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athos s compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it but said d artagnan it is the queen s diamond the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos				8.818558533976555
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying				14085.393798165605
good evening valentine said a well known voice				35.01379145249707
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m de tréville the counsels being thrown into the bargain				1943.397765764895
oh my dear friend if this be the case if you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then maximilian you are consoled do not complain count said morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth i come to die in the arms of a friend				153.519821506458
you will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used sir replied raoul putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count i owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me				14.635212401191039
the history of athos s imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong				4233.628980849411
devil take the vain fellow said d artagnan				1.0171108254281545
days even months passed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course				1633.3904779276825
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our service then said tréville it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there the king looked at the cardinal				163.5210859271176
those wretches wanted to take away my sword				149.90784413811724
you may retire we consent to that				67.42241668053866
m de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio				14374.78261919427
just heaven what have i read cried the duke				13.808570362458683
well i have ten thousand for you you are not boasting do you wish for a proof yes there were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and a third upon the rue saint denis				367.0450807570304
the memory of richelieu annihilates me				37.20632157167698
i will extinguish the fire with blood				3432.243048501247
the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies				2598.5256582834386
france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eighty five departments i say eighty five because i do not include corsica you will not find then in these eighty five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp				33937.17279911935
in the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them				155.02024736381045
do you speak spanish grammont faith my lord but indifferently and i not at all said the prince laughing				57.47519449231498
thank you said monte cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of you you said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said madame de villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject indeed madame said monte cristo i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going nonsense say on well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together what is it a telegraph				16827.249615562992
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded				2363.961429950648
true enough he wanted to kill me returned the turnkey				1073.4022770514296
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock				18148.792182803216
athos is near you said d artagnan warn him as i have warned you aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution				38178.574284584225
but monsieur commissary said he calmly believe that i know and appreciate more than anybody the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be governed indeed asked the commissary with an air of doubt				929.6448463483534
eugénie danglars i can not in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me vicomte you know i give my daughter two millions ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp				41.88030202004262
so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of a legion of cæsars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads he who dreads nothing as it is said				215.49941249279917
captivity the fifth day milady had however achieved a half triumph and success doubled her forces				5322.9983473808
oh god thou hast preserved my memory i thank thee i thank thee at this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall the guide was coming monte cristo went to meet him				1.9487087004398058
in a dungeon which good lord				524.7914602554617
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations				6393.546219089167
independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man				1953.2268580484545
where is your master you monsieur d artagnan cried grimaud impossible grimaud said athos coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown grimaud i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak ah monsieur it is silence grimaud contented himself with pointing d artagnan out to his master with his finger				289.8039650786889
they said he was so accustomed to darkness that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon he spent fourteen years to arrive at that muttered the count				15.319820296261675
well here are 8 000 francs on account the major s eyes sparkled brilliantly				53867.43432212909
it may be judged whether d artagnan looked or listened with avidity				2943.1972180441585
is the count shooting in the gallery said morcerf				152.8352847448369
no more edicts no more of the cardinal s guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds				27380.713200409395
i shall be at home till midday or if not i will leave a receipt with my steward the money you desire shall be at your house by ten o clock tomorrow morning my dear count replied danglars				78.36158711712726
two open in these caves the treasure is in the furthest a which treasure i bequeath and leave en as my sole heir				1121.3015716574064
but we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it				12.312166633493073
dantès took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body				2053.5377899654254
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men				769.7961915065864
he arose and quietly opening the door of the drawing room saw haydée who had fallen on a chair with her arms hanging down and her beautiful head thrown back				141.68659951031808
do you mean is he a good comrade				939.358057050557
30087m so we meet again my travelling friend do we cried the countess extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first visit on me be assured replied albert that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this				559.5458929473765
have you traded it for your diamond no				179.3559788291059
noirtier s eye was fixed on the dictionary				2119.376822370378
awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressing gown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames				19706.603631927122
he crept from his hole and stood hidden by the black drapery beneath the scaffold				1779.846660148402
when i go back to france i must suggest some such convenient course to cardinal mazarin and the coadjutor				237.9891749441151
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinal s arm				98.20485785571326
he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet				23237.11113513044
if i am guilty if i have committed the crimes you accuse me of shrieked milady take me before a tribunal				66440.6894965717
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a well stuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward				27501.460738962396
and moreover my dear child continued d artagnan i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian i do not understand you sir said raoul				63.67086340715587
you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costume a ball costume doubtless becomes her admirably ah monsieur returned albert i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this				799.7464185619159
the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man				189.38871456384123
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal				3.0344752768514245
since in our romance of the three musketeers we took leave of d artagnan at no				155.11215643063798
still further buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english imperial and spanish armies				34920.01465711301
let us attend to what is more pressing first and then we will attend to my wound besides it does not seem very dangerous and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy functionary				19965.671205916715
and that other gentleman				1342.0421012466272
near paris is it not very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil at auteuil said villefort true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken				344.9107060915594
let us wait by all means				491.78889307127037
what is it said she starting at madame danglars touch as she would have done from an electric shock				8978.35932254438
but for heaven s sake resumed aramis				12.435004534288822
we did better than that sir said the old sailor respectfully we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten minutes after we struck our top sails and scudded under bare poles the vessel was very old to risk that said the englishman				96.65246335024416
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be it is in fact magnificent said andrea				126.81031346662928
he rose however as they approached				1313.4027002700786
oh hear me to the end				383.5853198109465
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out it would be very easy if you much wished it how so probably you have some correspondent in greece i should think so at yanina everywhere well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today do so i will 30259m and if you should hear of anything very scandalous i will communicate it to you you will oblige me danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coupé				28631.159600793177
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madame thanks for your punctuality and he offered a chair to madame danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated				5427.570975921298

tomorrow perhaps he may change you				91.23940372723746
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom				6120.443960657063

he will never believe that my death was suicide and yet it is important for the honor of my memory and this surely is not vanity but a justifiable pride it is important the world should know that i have consented by my free will to stop my arm already raised to strike and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others i have struck myself				184.4513547621328
m bonacieux lived on very quietly wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife and caring very little about it				13.765962481596489

go go directly d artagnan rose took his hat as if it had been his intention to obey then opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of milady				803.8426442648247
his company was on guard at the louvre he was at the louvre with his company				2297.0759811688577
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue				4243.957379761172
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating				12386.614829822302
time was getting on however and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day				291.69139384287644
the procureur went out after having double locked the door				19.480282303384666
hem said the king				22.129486577978444

don t be afraid said d artagnan				1.0157822377637082
i say that he has hastily accused your majesty s musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources the accusation comes from monsieur de la trémouille from the duke himself				409.12468632567806
ah very well replied the cardinal quickly				60.76005847229939
but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet how my friend planchet				285.0992246830407
all three then cried all s over hush said d artagnan				1.0145475866030433
milady as athos had foreseen on finding the two men that awaited her made no difficulty in following them				27.545345351687867
what next asked albert				60.270376447958704
no in truth you are no visionary my dear friend and now i think of it you yes i faith you re right those delicate yet firm set lips those eyes which seem always at the command of the intellect and never of the heart				583.1889305355749
are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage what a confounded long time this first act lasts				30745.149184128128
the point aimed at by every poniard				13399.792990553478
marie michon was a very aristocratic person like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest athos paused				574.847071062481
they ask my name i can not give it since my parents abandoned me				10.152867480617115
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused				1140.3697142194799
and you too my poor monsieur mouston are out of place in this poor hotel are you not asked d artagnan in that rallying tone which may indicate either compassion or mockery				38897.13960403772
oh yes and with all my heart for i know what it is to be in love you know what it is to be in love said d artagnan looking at her for the first time with much attention				576.7569350404668

mademoiselle said eugénie let the porter get the post chaise from the coach house and fetch some post horses from the hotel				450.77469006793706
when d artagnan returned to the palais royal at five o clock it presented in spite of the excitement which reigned in the town a spectacle of the greatest rejoicing				12620.948945226868
i bear the traces of our friendship three slits or slashes from your sword well if you should be restored to favor don t forget me on the honor of a rochefort but you must do the like for me there s my hand i promise therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf i shall say it and you i shall do the same apropos are we to speak of your friends also athos porthos and aramis				4.472277842968459
political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation				31757.63969149654
the host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they wished				2003.6408193798645
in fact at the end of a few minutes the belfry of st				503.04194742020974
on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady and bound her hands and feet				3099.037844651165
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength				1923.0576683029333
my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body				2943.4456348933786
here is madame returning with monsieur d artagnan looked out and at the corner of rue montmartre saw the hostess coming along hanging to the arm of an enormous swiss who tiptoed in his walk with a magnificent air which pleasantly reminded him of his old friend porthos				69.60264851091311
d artagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame pooh said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in d artagnan s proposal pooh				6313.168151839872
the duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the casket				8921.071833747486
now the portmanteau let us make haste the portmanteau stop said louise going to listen at madame danglars door				27.76032718022591
it might alienate my protector				11589.489508037355
m danglars appeared debray reseated himself				25.22435272890666
yes madame said the young man				1.6529226088207405
but when i have found them then tremble sir				135.0262144548656
all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m caderousse yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard caderousse at your service gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest				653.6970913663853
allow me to introduce my friend baron de château renaud one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in france and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ de mars yesterday château renaud bowed to the countess				237.9564943485882
on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame as she always did on saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice				1112.7272719080738
perhaps not so great as you think porthos you know the proverb all roads lead to rome but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked porthos				13.630168581042822
now sir said monte cristo addressing andrea make your confession to whom tell m cavalcanti something of the state of your finances ma foi monsieur you have touched upon a tender chord do you hear what he says major certainly i do but do you understand i do your son says he requires money well what would you have me do said the major				69.87170043407741

come in my braves said the king come in i am going to scold you the musketeers advanced bowing d artagnan following closely behind them				14.759988529501266
there s not a moment to lose now take my horse to the nearest inn and conduct me to your vessel but asked the sailor where are your companions				600.9457919467969
bonacieux hesitated to continue				10055.908789090277
the traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of thomson french which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in rome				1483.4403872473013
there was the crime bertuccio that was where you became really culpable true excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that i acted like a coward				2422.755270894944
i did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they dreaded				23168.91232962988
you know no one but monsieur de tréville he asked				28.483145998369018
anne then motioned to d artagnan to approach and he obeyed				516.4439887553153
here s a sword and a dress said porthos				12.466155428016378
but he had gone farther than athos for at the village of festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further				1368.9970985631626
those were good old days never fear these people owe us no grudge is your honor sure i can answer for it they do not well we won t speak of it any more then and planchet took his place in d artagnan s suite with that sublime confidence he had always had in his master which even fifteen years of separation had not destroyed				3201.668455570663
yes undoubtedly the abbé busoni himself replied monte cristo				1.011550068879812
morbleu my part is taken				260.55916890494854
aramis notwithstanding his self control could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise				849.8577877412503
as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him				117.11785467569399
i wish to speak with monsieur aramis				37.57883533518423
but it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary				21248.07714021992
they know that i am intimate with you that you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you				4.504465579983494
in this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet pleased with himself d artagnan reached notre dame				73.30596412820776
dragoons swiss guardsmen musketeers light horsemen succeeded one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host very well but agreed badly with the views of the four friends				83.60135456586768
long life to his eminence				513.8380168258894
now as d artagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his				1436.01280077524
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering				125.41052546630387
yes what to do noirtier made no answer				77.41010123965965
i said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment				6411.619905001087
england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained				20235.95893130277
fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome teresa				7461.42317838404
war has broken out in flanders				6723.909694317158
what scotch ours egad exclaimed athos				5.978841636213581
mazarin especially yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreigner well he would be more justly estimated				36132.96136399158
the king was already sanguine but when he perceived aramis his hope turned to joy				61.28416139259058
and now my young friend for you will permit me i hope to give you that name said lord de winter on this very evening if agreeable to you i will present you to my sister milady clarik for i am desirous that she should take you into her good graces and as she is not in bad odor at court she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will not prove useless to you d artagnan blushed with pleasure and bowed a sign of assent				1173.0710620944774
this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau				4167.301070718819
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring				2680.3316914119964
he had his foot upon it that is all and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his and you were deceived my dear sir replied aramis coldly very little sensible to the reparation				21543.531473709852
i take that god to witness at whose feet i have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years that i would have sacrificed my life to you and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it				7.522313703953646
we learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these victories				12848.475117002728
i valued it much said mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless i give it to you with great pleasure and i my lord said d artagnan accept it as it is given				858.0877635283788
why it is indeed a true royal jewel which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier				33872.60138125937
one of the sailors got down the side of the ship seized the cable and drew it it came without the least resistance				2063.774349481496
here said she you see i have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be cold but you oh i am never cold you know				61.104385369135365
oh you are so kind and i am so grateful how can i avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable				8066.137262245655
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone				91.00655090126263
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating				18013.41422441532
then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife are we then going to travel my lord asked mousqueton rather uneasy				1023.047337925688
ah what a dreadful thing said the young musician who would have suspected it				5.65582328988371
i am luigi vampa shepherd of the san felice farm what do you want i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca follow me then said the sentinel or as you know your way go first vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before				377.76625341487943
wait what are you going to do asked aramis				10.748596321242523
are you on the ground asked d artagnan				1.0233962537319763
ah to be sure cried porthos there is a diamond				707.5927155197405
three days after about seven o clock in the evening i saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop and take the road to sèvres				11014.687643171346
and now let everyone retire must i go too asked valentine timidly				138.40555491069884
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night				48.04905285432583
go valentine said madame de saint méran and leave me with this gentleman but grandmamma leave me go the young girl kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her eyes at the door she found the valet de chambre who told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining room				2.0728726948834963
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar				388.18537715955154
he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in m de tréville s stables one for himself d artagnan and one for planchet and bring them to athos s place				233.35344276064325
the glance was of sublime eloquence				1904.310185130364
there is no occasion to tell you my lord that the minister knew for a fact that these ornaments had sailed away with the ambassador who was far away beyond seas				30245.9248102021
therefore d artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort				583.9533337217769
the horses only arrived at two o clock and the cicerone did not bring the passport till three				13046.615456221469
and as for me said porthos i swear nothing but i m choked				406.389790707531
i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse				7797.075313413925
at a hundred paces from the gates of calais d artagnan s horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose				43587.830097069724
the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion				1363.8009948636554
did you observe that man s eyes while he was speaking to us no but have you ever watched him carefully doubtless he is capricious but that is all one thing alone struck me of all the exquisite things he placed before us he touched nothing				154.94856211166112
he showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers as he felt some self reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice				3508.7207190969248
it was easy to do so and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea everything favored my project				1086.9121007160625
leave the box sir monte cristo pointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity				3674.482114414133
i am ready said he				7.773088100378397
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortune brilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any				1170.165415133365
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant				1144.6081068251463
since i was a faithful servant my lord to cardinal richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death i should serve you well in defiance of the whole world with regard to myself monsieur de rochefort replied mazarin i am not like monsieur de richelieu all powerful				24864.462134310616
no and you porthos no and you athos no if it was not you it was your purveyor said d artagnan				1.0182038549687356
at the lesser gate of the castle he s posted there are you a large party sixty let him know this moment sir and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return				918.223315617843
at midnight they withdrew to their chamber the door of which was left open on the pretext of kindly consideration				60664.55864633452
thank god we can keep a secret the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker				2318.7877368435006
when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have i ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you				9.971554601842277
what matters it about broussel it is a name not a thing mazarin clever politician as he was was for once mistaken broussel was a thing not a name				152.58828392680377
the king came out first from his room				113.37127676908962
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it				14.930631633596127
he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land				2437.6064122220805
spy cried the duke more and more enraged i will strangle you with my own hands and he extended his hands toward grimaud who merely thrust the guard out and shut the door behind him				1.3366120953822338
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door				13.824635856465031
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition				366797.72003821563
they were indeed admirably received by mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely d artagnan his captaincy porthos his barony				2745869.2610243238
but you are dripping my dear fellow you must change your clothes as calypso said to telemachus				124361.92075893938
he found her in a charming humor				517.3956731843082
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation				1321.8431403441841
the two witnesses followed				8433.873251749994
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table				90.34234789493107
what procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against m magendie or m flourens in consequence of the rabbits cats and guinea pigs they have killed not one				651.9889902266674
this idea while darkening his brow drew several sighs from him and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance				1653.1448506023728
thomson french said he do you know this house monsieur 20253m they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world returned the count quietly				6759.592975794377
it may easily be understood therefore that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminence s guardsmen had received				761.4651219449511
after numberless windings dantès saw a door with an iron wicket				15838.28024545166
père pamphile had seen dantès pass not ten minutes before and assured that he was at the catalans they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring				6687.024398071581
m de villefort notwithstanding his self control was visibly affected and when monte cristo touched his hand he felt it tremble				2431.762203066161
the unknown day for which dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned				431505.14534002024
parliament indeed cried athos				6.903659674667446
unfortunately i had not above 1 500				33896.15876964138
except that which i ask of you dear love but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness i can not wait till tomorrow silence				1153.8505448256162
athos threw a piece of money to the goatkeeper to withdraw				2188.6298311980727
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement				1392.367685895333
how old was she franz assured me replied albert that she was sixty six years old				44.92450334730318
at dessert d artagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease				2263.113595939893
he was seeking in his mind then for the least awkward means of retreat when he remarked that aramis had let his handkerchief fall and by mistake no doubt had placed his foot upon it				11.504349503741782
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour				1253.088502367269
felton was then mistrusted				10972.42559239854
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation and in noirtier s name gave that order				3906.060704685366
nevertheless as if they had been aware of the numerical weakness of the friends the rochellais continued to advance in quick time				286.7064040399591
the groom cried aloud for help				99.4965933068743
the apartment of m bonacieux then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal s people				950.1005866270315

very well until the moment when the comte de la fere resumed raoul said come bragelonne draw your sword then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me				24.384804936808937
i may continue to rely upon it may i not oh sire cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your majesty s service well well but keep whole that will be better and you will be more useful to me				14.70532996217684
106 and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker				2422.866178368281
bassompierre took up his quarters on the north of the city between leu and dompierre the duc d angoulême on the east from dompierre to perigny and m de schomberg on the south from perigny to angoutin				21937.830924901362
look at your brother monarch charles i				77.10992566929814
idole de mon âme i was the first to discover duprez at naples and the first to applaud him				3.372083333252458
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better friend than you and as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house				181.17006716991705
friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts d artagnan				1.100257276520869
the halt at noyon was but brief every one there being wrapped in profound sleep				1449.487024099554
leave me alone said aramis impatiently				52.57121326184399
no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the dispute a proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse				2430.760554257943
this time it was the hour and from this moment milady waited with impatience				292.310719582432
he is not dead then no monsieur he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body for you without question inflicted four upon the dear gentleman and he is still very weak having lost almost all his blood				1513.2454797172059
now what would you say to an ensign s commission in my guards and a company after the campaign ah monseigneur you accept it do you not monseigneur replied d artagnan with an embarrassed air				73.0179080759962
on entering the room noirtier s eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room				57.096649960737196
if he is here this is what the other man said let s see decidedly what to do with him what to do with him answered the prince				71.90184559326387
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed				2867.0682334462904
yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him what is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal				37.2872746160352
she listened at eugénie s door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place				1324.2076317244002
to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments				20932.366093468354
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself				69.90755917966308
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count bad replied athos very bad but you received it with enthusiasm as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear d herblay				743.9425015114418
swear by your hopes of salvation to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited				8255.121047429177
my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still i shall love you as i loved my father it is well returned the voice tomorrow these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall				98.36682789703991
this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore				827.7312198727592
i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms				165.88119812855362
oh pray do for heaven s sake tell us all about is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving				6214.438069902915
above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea bird				1072.026315241797
without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard				8206.556088400539
he found athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find him				4.128621102056248
did you see him they all asked				226.50319620215282
neither gold nor rank you have given me all you can give me and from to day your debt is paid and mordaunt darted out of the general s tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy				35.465600364796856
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose				1353.6976550263312
gracious heaven we are hesitating cried d artagnan if we hesitate what will the servants do i do not hesitate you know said grimaud				79.23796950842288
we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m noirtier even she would have been constrained to pity him				9.205057184189608
but what ails you father				264.5227112838183
the plan adopted by d artagnan was soon perfected				20348.705000162972
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos				256.0715471000171
is he a deputy oh no				91.61921931354689
the harlequin had reassumed her peasant s costume and as she passed she raised her mask				829.3356210650069
he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo				1.0332453265650636
the deuce cried d artagnan do you live in this way always yes pretty well				58.50623218893601
and you shall be alone replied the young man				1.3570168011229609
who is this groslow asked porthos				245.07458563235403
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths				20388.467958004185
i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but i could find nothing				279.4822716681363
i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses indeed said monte cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent				4119.8898047115335
to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death				266.7989555957364
do you think so				33.49426516771914
this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs d eau c est bien prouvé par le déluge 1 you said sir you would like to help me but yes but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die death alone can separate them remarked fernand				792.9421400331782
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal				3255.0506143590187

we shall have our revenge				1077.7087974086162
he opened his mouth to reply but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him				3.815268617411044
no replied the count carelessly for the other he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name for peppino called rocca priori				4952.442014878508
seek quietude and oblivion so that you may return peaceably to france after a few years				387.46341422908813
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrate s first impulse was to pause				6297.425603230704
felton gently repulsed milady and she sank into a chair				150.25908682934244
for my part i declare d artagnan i think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom d artagnan blushed				65.60415612649844
aramis at this movement drew his sword				129.3021740466981
why does not god if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether you speak as though you had loved this young dantès observed the abbé without taking any notice of his companion s vehemence				9400.88930137561
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude				1898.4188350032753
six days had already passed out of the ten he had asked from mordaunt he was therefore occupied in revising his reply to cromwell when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen s apartments				1397.002995055073
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactor then count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols				2216.4052184895736
i content myself with saying command monseigneur i am ready your pardon said richelieu surprised				290.0716230879708
sensible i always obey madame when i am commanded by so gentle a voice he kissed her hand tenderly				607.9602611980541
groslow said aramis the devil				1291.3704541423508
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest				1651.6068421893926
andrea cavalcanti chapter 57				1821.7330710885544
what is the matter				117.74854188055943
bills upon his majesty s private treasury answered d artagnan who reckoning upon entering into the king s service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood				1567.2586989882154
bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight				6589.897010775828

they led me away masked				311217.03560904204
oh madame i do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times i am your most respectful servant the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes				17.289635068973073
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do				161.3775918531356
the article was not inserted by me i was not even aware of it but you have by the step you have taken called my attention to the paragraph in question and it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a right to do so sir said albert rising i will do myself the honor of sending my seconds to you and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the place of meeting and the weapons certainly my dear sir and this evening if you please or tomorrow at the latest we will meet no no i will be on the ground at the proper time but in my opinion and i have a right to dictate the preliminaries as it is i who have received the provocation in my opinion the time ought not to be yet				725.6937997182152
peppino mounted the seat behind				894.4818582284423

tis true thought the gascon where has he heard it				11.125171070727536
all this is perhaps folly perhaps insanity but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love what queen a servant more ardent my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly				7204.846701809602
this garden has never been a cemetery what is done to infanticides in this country asked major cavalcanti innocently				5097.573923583091
no i repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almighty s pleasure dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé s plans				3223.8050782919945
if it were one of your friends you would hesitate then cried milady and a threatening glance darted from her eyes				12.570307679861351
lord de winter passed before the door without stopping and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away				72.75491765480892
and do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment and if this priest wished it in an hour you would be without a crown				33499.08407735282

i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued d artagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen aramis colored imperceptibly				1541.5728862693059
we will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united				3470.5955607812325
i m beginning to feel queer cried blaisois				1130.8367013206935

a newly born infant repeated debray this affair becomes serious well said château renaud i was not wrong just now then when i said that houses had souls and faces like men and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters				4426.589883040451
but d artagnan was not a man to let himself be killed like that				182.4822013279576
there one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility i will inform you of in the drawing room namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and m de monte cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which i have never forgotten				239.4516680693345
then turning to noirtier do you hope the assassin will be tried no then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine yes it is no news to you added d avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject				75.97557530067223

this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart				1245.103115293199

40227m the stranger cast one look around her to be certain that they were quite alone then bending as if she would have knelt and joining her hands she said with an accent of despair edmond you will not kill my son the count retreated a step uttered a slight exclamation and let fall the pistol he held				880.1998491554897
what monsieur i have a miraculous balsam for wounds a balsam given to me by my mother and of which i have made a trial upon myself well well i am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you and at the end of three days when you would be cured well sir it would still do me a great honor to be your man d artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his courage				887.0699254598273
there was firing nevertheless i heard he said and your swords they saw the light of day i presume that is the night my lord i answered				5007.318278306022

trembling and awe struck caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest while la carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth				8128.067388512137
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment a conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation				586.1798823759984
d artagnan even fancied he could recognize amid this strange disorder fragments of garments and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains				2579.8594705990267
this woman gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to her but you should have inquired for the woman you should have traced her and what do you think i did				514.5223146883308

the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey				362.03306728366914

even his breathing seemed to be arrested				1243.8006004641948
supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well supposing the assertion to be really true a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father s honor ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit that is precisely the fault of the age and do you undertake to reform it yes as far as i am personally concerned well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow yes i own it are you quite impervious to good advice not when it comes from a friend and do you account me that title certainly i do well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject from whom from haydée why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair what can she do in it she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition you reject this means of information then i do most decidedly then let me offer one more word of advice do so then but let it be the last you do not wish to hear it perhaps on the contrary i request it do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp visit him alone that would be contrary to all custom your case is not an ordinary one and what is your reason for advising me to go alone because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp explain yourself i will do so				8.396698657241462
to the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal valentine s condition but to this hireling valentine only appeared to sleep				312.2270180087393

i beg you to return me that dispatch d artagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact				7268.193175843691

at the letter s the old man stopped her				23.391603392790696
the porter was not yet gone to bed				1523.5556245167197
yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé s gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays 0327m so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbé for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases you are wrong to speak thus said the abbé and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error what mean you inquired caderousse with a look of surprise				730.7015557222144

athos made him a sign to come with them				11.134795658537087

he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity				43495.06471172052
at this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile				133.889279687014
she did not invoke god we very well know but she had faith in the genius of evil that immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life and by which as in the arabian fable a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world				253.31581080238007

do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were oh				854.3275878144278

i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so but i know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you				18.035651452223203
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or lost ah said groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all i can understand that said d artagnan				120.51000615163038

the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me monsieur				66.96692476523525
d artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when m de tréville entered				43.99657272210143

a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface				13607.79793408215

but that is not all				151.63708951008846
see see said the young girl				4.222008467742374
40262m until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down				146.80318715990342

the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice milady s condescension				47039.381077028906
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff				9783.24020792003
and signed by whom by the king and the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of contempt				1328.3442722584346

20169m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions				15257.577951799229

he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith entered				142.6669816772275
the squares were broken to shivers and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room				15.978556831675766
in all probability therefore the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome as he had already done at porto vecchio and tunis				1588.9604943338043
felton remained behind he held a book in his hand				17.07203394354281
you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre days				1316.8938282798395

and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first time this garden the actual scene of my crime must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause				2210.046748822278
he had friends then after five years in prison				393.36544870442924
oh said monte cristo i allow of no excuse				602.1677496124034
even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy gates rolled on their hinges they had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning				554.8294316131391
has anyone brought a letter for me asked d artagnan eagerly				14.726577778538328
come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you know				61.24577496873778
i do not understand you i mean mercédès that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him fernand cried mercédès i believed you were good hearted and i was mistaken				155.69081204943117

danglars listened with the most profound attention he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf				812.4227153415419
but d artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips				64.36630994551406
the fact was in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day				178.06513498653283
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white bellied black clawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him				10.843092405355087
proud of this exploit vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders and carried him to the farm				11646.095021857705

paris is a horrible place in summer				8827.697407651847
i will say then monsieur quite short you may even say my lord replied athos who stickled for propriety				932.3421771190189
at length i felt a desire to study this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the secret part played by these insect actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string 30191m and are you going there i am what telegraph do you intend visiting				41451.50198842584

too late by a minute cried he too late by a minute				4822.632823535711
he looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its nail				5948.606364815509
well asked athos when he had closed the letter				76.16844384727374

it is a color very well known in botany but till the present time very rare among horses there are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh at the master cried the young emulator of the furious tréville				576.2835464645331
the house to which d artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening				17.670094196205113

the lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port 20063m my dear friends said morrel if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven				2751.3172903356017
which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume				6212.328576226
indeed almost before the door opened the scene changed				152289.1856611413
only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas what are they sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment				7384.467273629614

it lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent				102.1869881149781
come he said if i pay you the 100 000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease certainly said peppino				1544.0152820945666

he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united				4825.0250115943045
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fro of busy people				1446.9492012797616
were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million				11551.255460932516
the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested what				208.56504706871465
he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes				30.82172489989405
so if i do not send you more it is because i fear you would not accept a larger sum				2016.368926601788
you know wine is a deceiver but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand				96.60472850634831
therefore athos had invented the phrase family affair				1292.41584453599
and how many men had he with him i do not know sire answered the minister of police				443.9446032263507
he would enter into the minister s schemes with the more ardor because his natural activity would be doubled by necessity				4943.914873082881
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo				1.0529525288092934
no this is his blood where were you then where you left me under the scaffold did you see it all no but i heard all				42.05881454344245

he looked around him and saw mme				32.2012223691519
i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman that he may be at ease is that all he will know what that means he will guess at least				249.98679114707014
she still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love				526.5706735174487
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word				32.65838467006167
when i entered the house the first thing i beheld in the middle of assunta s chamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the rest of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight months old				70.95902543573904
i once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss				7368.582695898284
we are not come here sir to exchange hypocritical expressions of politeness or false professions of friendship said albert but to demand an explanation the young man s trembling voice was scarcely audible				859.8785125629719
you are about to become captain at nineteen an elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone you are right you know men better than i do and what you say may possibly be the case i confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you				4.941495076668763

then he is not dead 30213m no you see plainly he is not dead				312.3802546054727
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends poor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind				31780.48388357767
at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debray s apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions				3993.7510889761747

they had now arrived within sight of the little inn and could see on the opposite side the procession bearing the wounded man and guided by monsieur d arminges				634.5978464546715
when the procession reached the palace loud cries of long live their majesties resounded				23999.556599900538
i have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so i swear				26080.256951013154
too big for a youth too small for a grown man an experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer s son upon a journey had it not been for the long sword which dangling from a leather baldric hit against the calves of its owner as he walked and against the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback				841.7826060907247
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him				13.9561468797945
that i think is as much as i shall want but your companions i don t think they can be in need of any				1142.2881175976643

what has happened to you today to raise all these melancholy ideas this wound my dear d artagnan has been a warning to me from heaven this wound				977.6790309946606
rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner				387.7051517024258
what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners you are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad and you are not so any longer no captivity has subdued me i have been here so long so long when were you arrested then asked the inspector				29.049773514779325
no listen to me i have the true idea let us see your idea aramis said athos who felt much deference for the young musketeer				145.59791115766822
if it were as you pretend it is said he i should be forced my dear aramis to reclaim it myself for as you very well know bois tracy is an intimate friend of mine and i can not allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy you make the demand badly replied aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form the fact is hazarded d artagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis				26.32917306720509
the same evening andrea was incarcerated in the conciergerie				39645.975164938005
it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight				2658.697198928622
d artagnan was acquainted with villars cotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time villars cotterets was a royal residence				7287.064351152288
30179m you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not yes really this is too absurd said villefort				1087.571552945243
let this house be the first repaid my son and respect this man father i will said maximilian				131.2354685222473
it was the will of god that this should happen blessed be his name				93.77491310970204
during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts				401.8285729759459
d artagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think				7942.280051981573
he remained there some time alone				911.4196101219321
i told her of the scaffold oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also				475.11304304469974
no be not anxious he is traveling on business and will return ere long				884.5887709276443
my name is edmond dantès replied the young man calmly i am mate of the pharaon belonging to messrs morrel son your age continued villefort				53.60840706510652
adieu paris adieu his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise				4408.684711825767
look at my hat and cloak and d artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver				299266.24202050193
all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrini s the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting				3091.8938474373876
there s only the price we are not agreed about how not agreed about said caderousse				22.319561801949824
it will then be said of me that i died for the king so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing				377.5695993972798
this is the point of departure it is a syllogism				41447.035199803366
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain				596.8204679425902
that would spoil my plans sir said the gardener glancing at the sun dial the ten minutes are almost up i must return to my post				1337.5770360492918
as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the puritan				1413.6834228288071
aha said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter we will attend upon him with a gendarme				8125.447793898066
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal but now listen to this				173.9031898209327
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wife s writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents it ran as follows you know that i was a good mother since it was for my son s sake i became criminal				27748.207255211135
what is there more astonishing in all that i have said to you than in what you have told me no what i think astonishing is that you should expect my coming and yet that is the most simple thing in the world my dear sister				1769.3572431937498
m d épinay became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their cloaks				1599.029949707461
where is the man who brought the letter in the street he awaits the answer yes i must learn where we are going				1096.2044515876325
i shall meet with a victim				3823.2990030335777
your power is great i know but you also know that with the help of god men have often conquered the most terrible demons				3371.8235833016647
i told you of it yesterday				2840.692692990123
i cried bonacieux i deceive your eminence your wife in going to rue de vaugirard and rue de la harpe did not go to find linen drapers then why did she go just god she went to meet the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham yes cried bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes that s it				499.86273675391317
but continued the porter he would not take them andrea turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible				21609.29510313198
the cardinal has said several things which have agitated me therefore i will not speak more fully now				825.8431916288777
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind				43.48932629054129
god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away 20295m and what did you do with the child asked monte cristo				420.53160700359837
a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl				84.82124446443291
i am replied the latter gravely				290.5921612378549
count count said he				6.775386825193328
think if i am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a thief true said d artagnan				1.0180273050348299
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with d artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter				17577.801877125406
he would have spoken but his voice failed him				5.91503850316911
in eight days the campaign would open and he would be compelled to leave paris d artagnan had no time for a prolonged love siege				2481.4276912385008
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them				9.173086209267513
the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques				519.6934688678631
i wish to be sure of my revenge				648.7145257597364
his house has been full ever since				2478.2042828118306
although i had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling hunger				1714.120282935869
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot afoot my lord i have served always in the infantry				38762.75379326451
they threw themselves upon me				15.988575369650809
as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted				573.5859130256879
i will have him come in if you really wish it athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back				114.60618901243396
is this not more than a poor sailor like me could have hoped for yes my dear boy replied the old man it is very fortunate well then with the first money i touch i mean you to have a small house with a garden in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle				7041.155631558659
persons whom i do not like yes indeed				77.35984340017302
what is it you want said the inspector				32.63567973758655
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy				26.883250358314722
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village armentières read porthos armentières				20263.07219309955
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled and affixed his seal				1057.438683848443
he was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others				355.4665691099633
lovely as the greek girls of cyprus or chios mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral lips				2137.156657317804
now let me tell you some news eugénie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival				11756.178470841132
by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells				14149.803506952689
how he stares at him the insolent dog				3620.185781609866
d artagnan remained standing and examined this man				217.09599358961816
i ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table				392.24050732036125
what is he looking at				28087.452681532464
there was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of caderousse it was plain that the small shagreen case which he turned over and over in his hand did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous sum which fascinated his gaze				3637.829370802487
d artagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense				63038.52170267544
and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this mazarin would have you hanged do you think so i am sure of it then i would kill him rather than let him go and you would act rightly				1137.143744330722
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul				1998.4015229560944
but if he annoys you this young fool to be sure he does				956.7814368182619
this concerns your head i warn you who are you then demanded d artagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering it				5.728603794399439
you speak of him very much at your ease aramis he has probably been killed				445.61287785374316
what is it the child conceals it but where did he find it in his mother s laboratory does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory how can i tell				420.5975849354747
i pardon you for the death of poor felton i pardon you for the attempts upon my own person				692.4965321239077
you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination				42854.15396473305
speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracy a storm which menaces no less than your majesty s throne				1229.4001596806306
59 quick quick said caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti				1148.6886063093057
every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest thus multiplying his agony a thousand fold				19241.492520545806
the president looked at his auditors				6898.924886318768
porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet awhile				4097.390954740272
i am your landlord ah ah said d artagnan half rising and bowing you are my landlord yes monsieur yes				74.46487442005093
sir cried the latter am i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house				208.9758877903344
mademoiselle d armilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugénie one of the tableaux vivants of which the germans are so fond				5086.598933812261
you can sign it yes yes said caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge				3582.2601210056264
besides here is a piquant fricandeau and a fillet of beef i am recruiting myself said porthos i am recruiting myself				74.704473894803
you at least will be faithful to me arthur the horse as if it understood these words bent its red nostrils toward the king s face and parting his lips displayed all its teeth as if with pleasure				799.1113437337922
he is very young but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes				3106.162801062635
we must understand each other said the duke				14.248514974666895
that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans oh may god keep me from it and you too said d artagnan				1.0164173846879032
but how can i pay them oh nothing easier you have an account open with messrs thomson french via dei banchi rome give me a draft for 4 998 louis on these gentlemen and our banker shall take it danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed it				2505.5210193360003
you are insupportable cried the duke i shall beat you grimaud bowed				140.80161763257064
the worthy sergeant had recognized the minister s secretary and the millionnaire and by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to beauchamp				402.4126313269014
i confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might you are perfectly right my lord you think so				50.402299183402626

hallo continued caderousse half rising and with his fist on the table hallo edmond				743.8772323199742
he saw a corpse at his feet				159.12555828962277
the fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper				823.3024195466315
we have secured him yes said aramis through an infamous act of treason porthos pressed his friend s hand and said to him yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force look yonder at this instant the squadron that ought to have protected charles s retreat was advancing to meet the english regiments				19856.03206973356

this is the second or third time monsieur that you have repeated that name and yet i have told you that i do not know him you do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked				19479.336724915975
at the first word before i had even mentioned your father s name ah said he				7.8401613512949195
he let go the rope and fell upon his feet without receiving any injury				6651.026442530384
that will serve us for a relay said athos				6.183335985021787
he had passed and re passed his island of monte cristo twenty times but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there				723.5408383718647
the true difficulty of being admitted was not to be found at the first door and even the second was passed easily enough but at the third watched besides the guard and the doorkeepers the faithful bernouin a cerberus whom no speech could soften no wand even of gold could charm				31603.19216888081
the count of san felice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited				2952.050686613439
what might be the consequences				6994.414118897238
be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive me yes or no saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to puritans				9626.569578318853
these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king				61.819977338363884

he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor				1426.3481218823863
the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz				622.1491502214736
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others				463.2611259834354
you are the queen queen forsooth				19316.248942754995
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved				18939.929295727892
he was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector				26.000561985593603
that happened which m de tréville had foreseen				114.49481489406622
once for all tréville had placed his stable at d artagnan s service				454.00004869445524

if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain				429.95237636762596
monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds				5162.519584256914
they asked a thousand livres for him				12.278417146891243
toward paris who stopped him two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mention the viscount de bragelonne and it was this young man who brought the monk to you				135.35717463951946
he must now get his bearings				62472.65896467564
as for me replied athos to this recital i am quite at my ease it will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit handsome well bred noble lord as you are my dear athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations how young this d artagnan is said athos shrugging his shoulders and he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle				5733.608791972686
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman the most satisfactory part of the matter said d artagnan is that there remains no trace of it she had a son observed athos				30.885914413390505
when the operation was concluded and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a looking glass				170.46983968898172
you had only read a line or two said d artagnan read the letter again from the commencement willingly said aramis				4.214051211613967

athos s horse where is that in the stable how much is it worth fifty pistoles at most it s worth eighty				17304.540672161766
i would as willingly accuse myself				272.8978312885912
are you alone athos parbleu whom do you expect to find with me at this hour well well and d artagnan rushed into athos s chamber				159.48546982896823
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon				24225.92462211089
order of the king he said				28.066035827382898
yes replied m de boville i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers				493.5461090485409
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration				39543.79497053047
her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age				707.1683854254934

he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed				453.84204280835223
yes but it was fated that i should not keep it so then we are all right as regards the executioner said athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call him and this one had his said d artagnan but as good luck would have it just as i thought i should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken leg				3330.1547062283544
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried d artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other why does she love what we hate most in the world the spaniards and the english spain is her country replied d artagnan and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself				641.3512447088863
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter				95.36499679849537
do you wish for a name				154.98462230026703
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and that s a comfort can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition i don t know him but as you spoke to him you must have seen him oh it s a description you want exactly so a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman that s the man cried d artagnan again he forever he				575.2210765942935
still then i am a prisoner said milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer but i feel assured it will not be for long added she				61.89265397040536
during this time in the kiosk at my father s feet were seated twenty palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats				5849.739294953132
do you see that street				3759.2673742213533
we engaged our word our word included everything				151.3989554600469
dantès drew a plan of the island for faria and faria gave dantès advice as to the means he should employ to recover the treasure				1145.9881536815346
should he find him at all				22.33138908134377
porthos told him of it in his calm manner				202.76351089590082
your eminence he said might have dispensed with your attendants the honor bestowed on me is too great for me to be unmindful of it and so my dear count said d artagnan his eminence didn t actually insist on our attending him it is du vallon and i who have insisted and even in a manner somewhat impolite perhaps so great was our longing to see you at that voice that mocking tone and that familiar gesture accenting voice and tone athos made a bound of surprise				305.27364539666524
let me overtake him he				193.02786349988446
he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny				6885.745938592017
all the way along d artagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in m de tréville or whether he should only ask him to give him carte blanche for some secret affair				2087.033372388749
from the time d artagnan took quarters in that hotel the mistress of the house a pretty and fresh looking flemish woman twenty five or twenty six years old had been singularly interested in him and after certain love passages much obstructed by an inconvenient husband to whom a dozen times d artagnan had made a pretence of passing a sword through his body that husband had disappeared one fine morning after furtively selling certain choice lots of wine carrying away with him money and jewels				2718.795424129176
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him				3.145150131790482
the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream				532.2257073400547
but as this dream can not be realized since mademoiselle danglars must become my lawful wife live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole life it frightens me				5.1463441590917105
did you come here to fetch me				6.065854880842075
mazarin is almost king answered athos madame henrietta is almost no longer queen if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis i really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de voiture athos smiled				20.33575364159958
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be over here my lords				120162.0041211246
i know an inn little frequented but of which the host is entirely devoted to me				18.884907824276002
well the fact is morrel i was thinking that i too am weary of life and since an opportunity presents itself stay said the young man				1.2135503405287789
do you know monsieur d artagnan lieutenant in the king s musketeers said the voice you are monsieur d artagnan i am then you came here to defend him him				71.83272504152933
a carriage was in waiting				2935.6564638540326
let us go to rueil said athos				4.5350848822879595
alas said she i did all for the best				1669.605954551702
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey				11888.779942066887
balls parties and fêtes are over the italian opera is in london the french opera everywhere except in paris				149.71739519105117
for whom are you looking my fine fellow asked the fruiteress on the opposite side				399.3143513809146
no no dear d artagnan said the figure tis not the devil tis aramis gallop fast planchet and when you come to the end of the village turn swiftly to the left and planchet with aramis behind him set off at full gallop followed by d artagnan who began to think he was in the merry maze of some fantastic dream				1292.5686890040045
the time of the carnival was at hand				852.4467732850536
laugh at the chance which has brought your friend near to you and monsieur du vallon instead of being in the depths of despair about it but d artagnan was still in a desponding mood				545.1794660765918
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man				1.2380219744312928
this devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head i said at the time he would create a sensation here and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer				37173.438334641345
exactly my daughter that is precisely what i mean said danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ruined yes that is it ah said eugénie				140.89631607874207
he departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited you know not the subject of their conversation he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london was this woman english he called her milady it is he it must be he murmured tréville				161.71483448714926
i have but little influence now but all that i have shall most assuredly be his				1354.8755470458748
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest				3363.713906966922
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too				472.4316974613019
are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort				2.3300371319522717
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical				12028.714629586571
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting				5892.151306333507
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him				10.784397301014925
the young man knew quite well that after the succession of misfortunes which had befallen his father great changes had taken place in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that matters had reached such a point				699.1842931414011
be satisfied beautiful constance				469.38729785080574
i do not feel remorse because that woman i profoundly hold deserved her punishment				2439.42266566186
d artagnan ran out and returned directly after				2073.873048169829
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him				3.829676107673621
don t waste a charge				4618.6935588286715
d artagnan was pacing to and fro like a caged tiger with dilated eyes growling as he paced along by the bars of a window looking upon the yard of servant s offices				71084.40337974875
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door				17.5124229004493
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way perhaps replied d artagnan				1.0151512618978058
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women				628.8120456257022
they are not dead for the death of d artagnan would make a sensation				1576.2530832648822
he added that he did not know either m or mme				505.4673351654353
swords then cried aramis swords				1588.1939117979146
this voice was that of my father				111.87833597641902
what reason do you assign my reason replied the young girl				7.201451639788088
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword				145.43783230013955
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened athos you are becoming mad no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur d herblay and myself to madame henrietta				1208.8773467763008
should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart				503.68953070300233
d artagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung				4136.046152900887
morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you				111.07949166376045
it was indeed for him that they were there				1214.4678443827604
then internally if renée could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator well when we quitted naples captain leclere was attacked with a brain fever				1558.5616114876602
leave me then to act and have no fears for the result at least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should fail none whatever				5399.042891278797
yes said dantès do you know him no replied villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators 0103m it is a conspiracy then asked dantès who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm				3554.209879879558
the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty five or twenty six years of age				524.7081369281283
our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada				21882.604908575395
so at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting				6516.322040527792
this was the costume that best became the king				103.5603814824662
alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father s love				624.5716646250713
but i love her my lord and was jealous				45159.05319835645
who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m				1643.6262779312087
we will take possession of it and cut the cable				12913.606430970738
bravo cried one of the guests that is what i call talking to some purpose just the person we require at a time like the present said a second				451.0413020726165
he received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the parliament of bretagne				23427.381494717683
porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m de tréville and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies from the lawyer s dame to the baroness there was question of nothing less with porthos than a foreign princess who was enormously fond of him				118.71037088985939
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to d artagnan s chair				299.0871768191697
no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount it is tiresome to be always acting manfred				27300.665729648867
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the wax light always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment				9438.277391908377
but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others m de tréville was surprised to the greatest degree				22561.15517930756
monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel				2034.4396665372842
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there				282.89715662081187
the three friends burst into laughter				618.2684808538714
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride				1705.8848319777042
d artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris				86.14724861850496
d artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him				5.969978244567295
read this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe				4676.788679912704
fortunately as we have said edmond was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian women the wound soon closed				296.7000938826318
here said he are dogs who bark and bite at the same time they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your diamond friend caderousse caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look				129.88198918330042
besides remember that alexander was lame and hannibal had but one eye do you see any great advantage in adhering to this party asked d artagnan				1.0190579897357541
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage				3218.1898611942506
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me				56.70383226371385
you will have pity on me ah if you speak in that way said athos you will break my heart and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask				4024.2300613391744
i asked said athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure why how extraordinary said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment i understand english then				262.195113823315
a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely				23882.725225791666
tell your client that although i am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as i am sure to gain sure to gain repeated beauchamp looking with amazement at the count				33.95784089357042
we have our clothes some more splendid than others this is our credit but when a man dies he has only his skin in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most for third rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it				78.81223810533996
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brother in law monsieur de tréville is particularly attached to their majesties				6862.165773712957
at last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threatening still like a panther thirsting for blood she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate though they had never done her the least injury she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked and that executioner you saw that executioner who you say told you everything that executioner if he told you everything told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brother s shame and suicide				1753.8526473527438
god grant you as much				234.11209905963807
oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship				579.7154525080007
but do not despair you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my father s it was herrera				8118.631507359892
gloves of gray kid matching the hat well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old				103.24935137799228
all is well we may sleep tranquilly on this assurance the two friends fell asleep and d artagnan who was very weary bade good night to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him				6.532030248156523
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections				4717.467039421628
monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity				916.4744868270241
on the staircase he met athos and porthos who were coming to see him				2.461898765369901
just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road				4064.7759632048255
so no more delay no more hesitation or else whatever may be my repugnance to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you i swear by my faith as an honest man and at these words d artagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up				55.27095598931989
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge				33017.55580210523
he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there				1220.90245447526
athos and aramis were more and more astonished				575.5623905742007
it was a tolerably fine winter s day and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison				1035.8186794806088
twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one inch				34555.90047185206
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst d artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left				1027.0484935807067
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans				2507.8709510271447
i went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant				423.56662558777685
i had no such contempt for men before was i not a good ambassador in france yes for mazarin has granted what i desire have i not always fought for your glory and interests too ardently perhaps it is what i have just reproached you for				254.54808216271758
but be of good cheer with certain people everything comes round oh you render me the happiest of men				456.5334603476418
here i am in the heart of paris but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade sellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it				6.067596370634715
how replied d artagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed				551.6882024425192
the magistrates freely discussed their political views the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of josephine				7743.30688685789
well monsieur de busigny i will bet you said athos that my three companions messieurs porthos aramis and d artagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion st gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us porthos and aramis looked at each other they began to comprehend				4708.720246059617
you are much pleased with yourself said he to raoul when they were alone are you not well yes replied raoul				70.20834846303944
danglars asked for a knife and fork				3258.5976083466117
as to porthos his barony was perhaps dependent on that affair				1165.4094134134157
it was ten o clock when they arrived				447.80365148077556
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph				1009.7899671444573
the comte de toiras retired into the citadel st martin with his garrison and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of la prée				18774.283989717995
some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in hand				676.0753220254489
you came you say to see me yes well i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every day am i then to remain here eternally demanded milady with a certain terror				804.9634334585982
no it has been stolen from you stolen				25657.219198431292
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside				2124.9535500520115
all the preparations were made with a frightful calmness				1054.7324419025774
he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it				494.0907533640674
oh how charitable kind and good you are you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage you are wrong morrel i was really happy then you forget me so much the better how so yes for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena he who is about to die salutes you then you are not consoled asked the count surprised				106.92816860729803
march it seems that i am named la bruyere remarked d artagnan				1.0173591378108975
at length an honorable peer morcerf s acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived				482.94097795109155
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so				188.97889129847258
he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him				2.8528286050982326
when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are				79.49171402037678
ah here you are monsieur she said in her naturally calm voice but how pale you are				52.02409029941773
or richelieu for two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence				6229.503812874003
she was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the prince de marsillac the eldest son of the old duc de rochefoucauld whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the duc de condé her brother in law whom she now hated mortally				96862.39834901389
m danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation				3520.7272203104944
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature				22472.468890964603
well now that everything is decided cried porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner				1375.8488855967655
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message				9526.374156687149
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucien oh my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger s name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of a door keeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife				514.8406234442539
30207m good he said and m bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him				73.76576515902806
how can you find out you shall see gaetano consulted with his companions and after five minutes discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about they returned the way they had come and in a few minutes the fire disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land				2613.3175319183324

excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m debray lives some distance from here debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do				190.59153173670882

20121m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights				5761.695369059537
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eye glass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a half official air without smiling or speaking				1928.6281538727644
besides you owe me some thanks				938.4877024231823
i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit				4985.685051794299
what did your father tell you m morrel said he eagerly				12.526099008048824
the discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous				2291.6080341975226
you know one can not change his nature he said				12.359303079011331
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the 4 500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs élysées				1496.0136349527454
shall i leave you				4.790598720318343
keep the 50 000 francs you have left i give them to you				4.040017148543912
i tell you so by the faith of de tréville how so you will be assassinated and i shall die in the performance of my duty but your mission will not be accomplished that is true replied d artagnan				1.0164852136266966
can it be with me				16.55161608299252
m de monte cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject asked villefort after a moment s reflection what interest can this m de monte cristo or m zaccone son of a shipowner of malta discoverer of a mine in thessaly now visiting paris for the first time what interest i say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless fact like this				322.41431835494996
they were in earnest conversation				474.78941114903324
suddenly d artagnan touched something warm which moved				1748.2383571769421
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away that was true ah				168.1581040806309
at last one day emmanuel came to his wife who had just finished making up the accounts				1463.4546894707191
unfortunately edmond s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular				84605.90919406884
fire cried mordaunt fire upon them three or four shots were fired but with no other result than to show the four fugitives turning the corner of the street safe and sound				2920.0159803821266
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry boxes				11673.939135102622
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him				3.9056259132647178
franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it				13.310994974629647
from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a horse				585.537077168404
i will go and discuss the matter with the queen he stopped at the end of the corridor and said i can count upon you gentlemen can i not we do not give ourselves twice over said d artagnan we have given ourselves to you command we shall obey very well then said mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till i come back and turning off he entered the drawing room by another door				18.16887020871828
he received yesterday a message from the prince de condé he went to meet him at saint cloud and has not returned have you seen madame de chevreuse she was not at home				83.08610910832911
what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor				6998.804614972269
decidedly monsieur d artagnan you are the man i have been seeking				2211.7261416072943
from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a mark the trunk of some old and moss grown olive tree that grew on the sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand				201.14799060555274
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglars so be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned				1188.6506505486198
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea				380.96210537045835
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris				122.15150136365746
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought				947.2728296395168
permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours monte cristo shrugged his shoulders				38.59262328126205
poor kitty hoped to speak a few words to d artagnan when he passed through her chamber but milady herself reconducted him through the darkness and only quit him at the staircase				484.95855544759826
straw they all cried out straw				1630.1077653621007
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of sèvres				2156.387016419181
nonsense cried d artagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well i know an excellent method what i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted and then asked mazarin turning pale				29.287960384805118
he had my love				666.1277926906797
i mean as i love				649.4220424063575
ah yes it is indeed strange and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening				89.61382674996578
yes repeated the count				11.144104418730272
then she cried ahem under cover of the mea culpa striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward her				14.018615214535311
that one yes the third the one in the dark blue coat yes he is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the chamber of peers with a uniform				6227.092267146605
compression is needed to explode gunpowder				4137.34802327347
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds				2326.0878740811822
the count came towards him				1.730957360534962
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone				406.96650646833916
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon				2989.7097701938173
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and i know you well				61.9439092588847
she opened it quickly and read go this moment to the allées de meilhan enter the house no				88.61841799460132
what planchet is monsieur d artagnan here here i am my friend dear athos cried d artagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation				688.4114072193288
at this moment the coadjutor was announced a cry of surprise ran through the royal assemblage				180071.71341210147
since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he belonged				3637.6212184915253
the president rang the bell				151.98064332618037
what would you have my dear viscount said monte cristo wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other				948.6949281443965
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me				4.982203551765
it was from mme				187.34809000339038
d artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere				14702.40062864909
has the gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud d artagnan				1.064994814856283
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance				2625.8298437308804
besides d artagnan has not told us his idea yet and the musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast				2147.8161885407703
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear d artagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it i pray d artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure				474.2968000992985
i hastened to the innkeeper				3949.2105645098345
it was indeed planchet and grimaud				1348.458667180262
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green door				35.39484644409592
man s whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them				22.094359960127687
madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated i can sir said haydée drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother s faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs a greenish pallor spread over the count s cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence				504.26388306233724
gentlemen said he if monsieur d artagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours i shall be satisfied with your promise to convey monsieur d artagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the cardinal you have my word monsieur and here is my sword this suits me the better said rochefort as i wish to continue my journey if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady said athos coolly it is useless you will not find her what has become of her then asked rochefort eagerly				5.866729721926568
tomorrow then monsieur tomorrow till then god preserve your majesty however ill the king might sleep m de tréville slept still worse				6826.051685905408
besides you forget cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner				549.8225472865232
a few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered				41.316974577302545
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised d artagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter				1122.915321395828
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily				336.8964393049809
d arminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion				1549.7649820194806
dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier				17149.33800194509
bonacieux followed him with her eyes with that long fond look with which he had turned the angle of the street she fell on her knees and clasping her hands oh my god cried she protect the queen protect me chapter xix				6901.517628421789
do you not see your friends or are you too proud to speak to them no my dear fellow replied dantès i am not proud but i am happy and happiness blinds i think more than pride ah very well that s an explanation said caderousse				17.560282689784355
on the contrary that simplifies the matter greatly				2728.8170464066447
only one minute mr felton and you will have saved my honor to kill yourself cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself i have told sir murmured milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground i have told my secret				321.3492854980835
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances				3186.0460674622504
pray d artagnan said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that i shall have no head to converse with you				15.093121654690362
so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home stop a moment said monte cristo do not let me lose both my companions				500.4413160274769
as for you you have acted like a barmaid				48865.89291369873
as for me i will give my last sou for it				6.025800358472903
i regret not having heard them				25.377310462243006
bring the prisoner in again said the cardinal				17.116690415721116
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dantès if only to prevent your growing weary of me				34.43550827157836
dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession				5928.7329627892805
pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to d artagnan who pressed it respectfully				834.3540790125642
the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted				2283.352114793808
i do not hem said d artagnan there is some truth in what you say ah				76.92332913628
did not the messenger say your father s safety depended upon it but what danger threatens him then emmanuel she asked				15.753276390859865
he sees no one but the king				63.401165858765395
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor				286.58448262863584
do as i do				166.36241707475955
it seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought				2028.3739831315293
three months passed away				58.461027092248976
she must have a long arm hush said porthos placing a finger on his lips				50.814906901738524
this was all that m de tréville wanted				140.41408593774923
i shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me				99.16896602279492
i do not remember if it is exactly 48 000 francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference				909.4018320593769
he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert				249.64181753028026
troops five or six thousand men courage plenty then the thing is easy				574.9696105957993
the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of opulence				17669.687246679398
a burst of laughter was the answer but finished with a groan				178.1852354858682
0243m i awoke as the clock was striking six				704.2391069134768
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos everything degenerates i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis				3.9210546632674146
very well my lord it shall be so d artagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarin s flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness				2159.721106541606
his noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them				7.88670847614782
caderousse who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his arm tried to draw back then clasping his hands and raising them with a desperate effort oh my god my god said he pardon me for having denied thee thou dost exist thou art indeed man s father in heaven and his judge on earth				940.5619431852691
ah cried porthos would i were but a baron well my friend i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much porthos gave a start that shook the room two or three bottles fell and were broken				2514.92078707743
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor				1401.0189367853943
although athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress				949.0505599574905
an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms				16156.500924447677
aramis cried athos don t fire ah				190.46833676474552
d artagnan retired to bed not to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening				743.0317338768085
sir he said you have made a mistake you have given me gold i know it the concierge looked upon the count with surprise				46.10009804675521
nothing is concealed from the cardinal the cardinal knows everything in that case monseigneur do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife perhaps he may but you must in the first place reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wife s relations with madame de chevreuse but monseigneur i know nothing about them i have never seen her when you went to fetch your wife from the louvre did you always return directly home scarcely ever she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses i conducted her and how many were there of these linen drapers two monseigneur and where did they live one in rue de vaugirard the other rue de la harpe did you go into these houses with her never monseigneur i waited at the door and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone she gave me none she told me to wait and i waited you are a very complacent husband my dear monsieur bonacieux said the cardinal				21.25483413522649
it is in london they must be found what are your eminence s orders not a word of what has passed				3086.1610767884754
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a volcano an extinct volcano before the days when remus and romulus had deserted alba to come and found the city of rome				386.0606980814024
why about ten or eleven o clock shall we watch by the corpse of what use would it be				232.75046348578778
why has he not painted a spot upon his heart it would have been more simple meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men				226.69163550959354
my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod				11279.442656568208
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand				16.560078925999786
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him				2.5661418747850586
poor madame du vallon				53.21735400624896
she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately i think proper to give the signal				605.7191417436792
i may be mistaken but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display the remembrance of milady recurred to d artagnan				1.1180591603209356
your eminence may be certain of that the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately				191.01350483122474
the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles				527.8558034176892
the palais de justice communicated with the prison a sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clock tower of the accoules				8486.80992019071
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house				133.12934604137217
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert yes you are right watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger				963.5428044261225
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two soldiers				801.8507956333295
one only needs to be sharp that s all				167.22048984317266
ah said he you have remarked i must have been blind not to have seen yes said porthos that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom i have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church buried in this vile quarter solely for the sake of seeing me monsieur porthos said the procurator s wife will you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes				689.3318068640783
the young officer preserved silence				491.32175016400737

we separated at midnight				639.7031606030602
mousqueton s horse which had traveled for five or six hours without a rider the day before might have been able to pursue the journey but by an inconceivable error the veterinary surgeon who had been sent for as it appeared to bleed one of the host s horses had bled mousqueton s				45.37003027034714
this evening you said well this evening will come thank god				188.58110491819295
this immediately recalled to d artagnan s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme				25.721551881212985
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god				154.55142160916864
in which the plot thickens his visit to m de tréville being paid the pensive d artagnan took the longest way homeward				24592.88189160729
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought raoul handed the letter to the prince				189.368486747018
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son				2067.657257969136
perform your duty in camp i will do mine elsewhere				1023.9560751332739
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage				536.3012850586372
andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be thirty				2030.7091897869523

at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her lips				69.98734084655814
are you making a sketch after poussin oh no was the tranquil response i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort				24070.108626327095
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence				918.7861162746688
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains				17562.838445809153
she thanked them both with a smile				65.64621328078336

it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form				1185.4633213174277
happily d artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties				12688.847013881723
how grateful will m de villefort be for all your goodness how thankfully will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child				1330.9513842455926
d artagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in flanders spain yonder woman here				397.83705008134467
but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance				2385.8047665991394
she will however be in the salon in ten minutes it is a great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshal s staff to offer you oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur				350.38836992691904
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him				9.31078158117857
but what is the meaning of all these questions to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services oh said oliver with a slight curl of his lip i forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid sir i can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes how is that i have the payment under my hand i almost possess it what is it				121.24553532305758
at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a child s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother s voice when she enjoined me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given				491.57858866375284
i ve remarked that your puritans revel in that color but can you find your man said aramis to athos				11.06800964392202
ah traitor muttered d artagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse chapter xxix				1270.3939507551884
the total amount was found to be as m noirtier had stated				14775.238847757466
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death				230.62137621635515
you have guessed it answered aramis and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything he thought they were fighting				964.330168961406
the wise man my child has said it is good to think of death well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die i shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room				34.73837163425188
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth my father and mercédès come said the abbé closing his hiding place and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story dantès obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtier his arrival at marseilles and interview with his father his affection for mercédès and their nuptual feast his arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the château d if				47.42845723248067
perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master				590.0839170440241
m de villefort who examined him attentively and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze				2422.035650971799
the day on which d artagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province				3511.0604764793175
you are the notary empowered to sell the country house that i wish to purchase monsieur asked monte cristo				1.009003758784719
begone then to your beautiful duchess i will detain you no longer and she is not to be despised in my opinion now monsieur porthos once more and this is the last				1013.7450736746057
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob				2748.1783211373427
he was hungry he supped he went to bed				1355.9083363802001
there were nobles who made war against each other there was the king who made war against the cardinal there was spain which made war against the king				97.32601759007105
the halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for us thirty forty fifty sixty five men said porthos counting the reinforcements				22727.828265553857
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit				2070.850209053765
i sometimes wonder replied athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together				454.1555108844654
for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns without reckoning the value of that diamond he cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to d artagnan which is worth at least ten thousand francs he returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gun fire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through paris				197.21878154651068
do you remember how he cried on d artagnan on i am taken				676.7958978395475
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered				7705.76629752933
i was told there were such at the last exhibition he has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always kept and he is not robbed no his servants are all devoted to him there ought to be some money in that secretaire there may be				586.018346499724
athos examined it and became very pale				162.01623597471192
monsieur porthos was six feet high this man is scarcely five nevertheless said d artagnan the people are bowing very low to this person as he spoke he rode toward the tall horse to the man of importance and his valets				2978.6760418649665
the parisian army had organized with the promptness characteristic of the bourgeois whenever they are moved by any sentiment whatever to disguise themselves as soldiers				2873.6023209591945
we are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass what is to be done said porthos				10.81367409156034
an approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him				3.3800939157538417
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded				4477.334201280621
meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following day the day appointed by the judges				1886.01794252969
the sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his breast				150.40847780174886
i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses				875.2139947947222
england needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch				13743.316534881707
luigi vampa what think you of that inquired franz				54.23105462284188
i therefore may hesitate between you				7.152288530740979
was it the englishman who carried off 3 000 crowns from here the other day 50237m no he really had 3 000 crowns and we found them				242.85974428961774
to night we stop at derby and if there is a bottle of wine in the town let mousqueton buy it				12.868192241117784
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other				127.08368059359609
and will it be the first time you have ever been there dantès yes have you business there not of my own the last commission of poor captain leclere you know to what i allude danglars it is sacred				18474.739067888895
the insult at the banker s door beauchamp stopped morcerf				97.01673224499798
what is that asked d artagnan				1.0200510029430325
i am nearly thirty seven mind aramis d artagnan smiled as he spoke since we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future how formerly i was your junior by two or three years and if i am not mistaken i am turned forty years old indeed				684.5579543259008
in the name of heaven run call				2009.0174267615614
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each corner the signal agreed upon waved it in the air and the man came up to him				3.5942325524712966
excellent there is port wine in the cellar of monsieur le baron de bracieux suppose we ask these englishmen to sell us a bottle said the honest blaisois				619.4589026080752
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told raoul bowed				94.0745813983015
0127m meanwhile what of mercédès				243.3874591145064
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed				1538.4174845642258
the rigors which had attacked barrois gradually increased the features of the face became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder				5116.119886528671
de chevreuse and consequently the queen				78.5880510431919
what were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that monsieur de beaufort had escaped were you not oh no my lord said the incredulous soldier				185.76307025715198
much monsieur mordaunt would care				1101.9189356636248
the deed if you please mr notary and he signed it rapidly after having first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors				14757.889218549824
i did not even draw my sword but i took him who offended me round the body and threw him out of the window				61.226211238960154
the young girl had freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with their coronets				10592.549853338607
i see you require proofs				12421.878878367877
a deputation was therefore sent to the queen to entreat her to return to paris but she not only declined to receive the deputies but sent an intimation by chancellor seguier implying that if the parliament did not humble itself before her majesty by negativing all the questions that had been the cause of the quarrel paris would be besieged the very next day				86.47996572072441
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and nothing forces me to quit it do you mean to tell me that i may rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me you may shall i receive it from my father asked andrea with some uneasiness				910.6446156573518
here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm				102.41948295116549
at this time athos came up to d artagnan				1.0442457188601644
but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world				30.84291047349027
it was as a prey to this hallucination that d artagnan traveled at whatever pace his horse pleased the six or eight leagues that separated chantilly from crèvecœur without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road				272.15555247347606
the country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald				7565.022697329441
athos took his son s horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee				15383.962602381831
the first named malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato				3966.546940743739
oh my father must your past career always interfere with my successes suddenly a light passed over his face a smile played round his set mouth and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought				644.389093907622
perhaps when all is considered you are right				408.5260161152008
listen to me said the countess and do not be so very headstrong				9341.930306932503
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as d artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but d artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line				3386.7157607708637
they then determined to depart				1043.9546531165502
but continued morcerf à propos of danglars we have strangely wandered from the subject				107.33418475352074
then i will add two words about the young greek girl monte cristo motioned him to be silent				305.16245336711813
the king danced facing the queen and every time he passed by her he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the number				15785.893827948297
alas said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim				4183.324170012246
they were surrounded by a crowd of people who opened a way for us to pass when suddenly my mother having looked closely at an object which was attracting their attention uttered a piercing cry and fell to the ground pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the gates and beneath which were inscribed these words this is the head of ali tepelini pasha of yanina i cried bitterly and tried to raise my mother from the earth but she was dead				154.4420219937432
the hostess replied only by gasps				713.9808165205396
he turned to brush away a tear and then summoning up all his firmness drew his daughter toward him recommending her to be pious and resigned				1691.7017878832653
alas faltered out the abbé all is over with me				79.46692827494235
her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess				544.7829086238169
what a beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian				147.55214415414122
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit				475.9234286359989
i gave one to the sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father the pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the emperor napoleon to his predecessor pius vii				11900.37305140502
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to find their masters				1603.1969687541584
attend to monsieur le cardinal gentlemen said d artagnan for myself i will reconnoitre the gascon then drew his sword and marched as avant guard				322.161823889232
one of the officers went to the place i directed				13805.872330505355
come down athos came down his friends who anxiously awaited him saw him returned with joy				25.189579978959358
it was mordaunt with the order in his hand				26.65188293256785
no monsieur returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea				22296.73618140171
coquenard s chamber they were heartrending				13011.15363605857
this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable odor				3889.941978210077
tis not civil war that disunites us				1548.699731160132
he is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse the executioner muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection				2516.111882273993
and indeed i am not sorry to quit paris i had need of distraction well you will have distractions enough gentlemen be assured said d artagnan				1.0155102014161057
madame de villefort is ill 50087m but mademoiselle de villefort stammered the nurse				2938.6606354828855
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek				4212.645761285094
when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard				284.40470869775226
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large				7858.183568007326
go upstairs she said to the doctor				161.94424997466626
as he gained the top of the rue guénegaud he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him				2676.881814703054
the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water				1067.9196972402215
see here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of arstein eskeles of vienna to baron rothschild the other drawn by baring of london upon m lafitte				57033.60807794444
the mandaïa 6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer				16677.425117726034
upon the landing leading to the chamber and crouching against the door he found the poor girl all in a tremble				1710.7079521990897
if on the contrary i die remember maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man				78.43728923598765
that will be for another time he owed me for the councillor the pettifogger but said porthos if he was not crushed completely ah				776.6099434017119
alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words				559.9435844955385
i shall die of it oh yes i shall certainly die of it and then falling upon the chair nearest the door she burst into a paroxysm of sobs				1789.5831372913883
another might threaten to seek m franz to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be folly				2070.5401703496786
oh misery oh vanity you take it however yes but i make hereby a vow in your presence to employ all that remains to me in pious works his face was pale and drawn like that of a man who had just undergone some inward struggle				2576.7748124833925
i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba i do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand then did you see him edmond who the marshal yes morrel looked around him and then drawing dantès on one side he said suddenly and how is the emperor very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him you saw the emperor then he entered the marshal s apartment while i was there and you spoke to him why it was he who spoke to me sir said dantès with a smile				7.614109740390577
at first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves				1354.274203324444
30 yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a garden you must know it possibly but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior				7633.166357892314
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur				636.7469099793274
my sister how did your husband die horror cried porthos and aramis				6.903829210704309
are you not married asked the countess				74.72303519408767
i imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers and i wept				1753.5967575755594
how happy i am at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started up				54.10612982951082
barrois therefore as we have seen watched for valentine and informed her of her grandfather s wish				1998.9628670098905
there fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material love that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption				2750.274503397974
it was evident that the execution was in the eyes of the people only the commencement of the carnival				6220.343718005472
what our enemies say of us is then true				712.0805602878916
in order to see the queen said aramis we must first see the cardinal and when we have seen the cardinal remember what i tell you athos we shall be reunited to our friends but not in the way you wish				538.0325415551875
the first will be mazzolato the second decapitato yes continued the count it was at first arranged in this way but i think since yesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony really said franz				915.5672682719767
treat him kindly therefore in the future captain said the young king to d artagnan on descending from the carriage the queen has charged me to invite you to dinner to day you and your friend the baron du vallon that was a great honor for d artagnan and for porthos				91.29323694246504
the man is tired said the captain conduct him to his bed oh murmured danglars that bed is probably one of the coffins hollowed in the wall and the sleep i shall enjoy will be death from one of the poniards i see glistening in the darkness from their beds of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by albert de morcerf reading cæsar s commentaries and by danglars studying the life of alexander				5417.80722560056
at the same time four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the almo surrounded the carriage				567.2793049444067
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself				579.44737753654
i desire to know what is the meaning of this be kind enough madame to listen to me said danglars				68.93639980779653
have you seen him yes sir said mordaunt				183.91825035624126
the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn but of what sort eh				2320.950357225098
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood				946.9964327020688
we must go and look for them all right said athos				6.417674834133212
fortune is precarious and if i were a woman and fate had made me a banker s wife whatever might be my confidence in my husband s good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk				8543.166160736217
oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings morrel again changed color				1251.5132377895643
ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore you d artagnan felt himself bewildered				787.9694680332605
but go on signing said monte cristo i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and i beg to apologize to you baroness and to mademoiselle danglars the baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary				97.9707645415267
hurry hurry said andrea we must overtake him soon and the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at louvres				1227.7586577813165
that s the thing replied the gascon				34.70695462261356
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy but at any rate you know where he is monsieur d artagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted				2156.5803352300177
oh said athos oh no it is impossible				179.7708196620031
you will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like kings the queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the princess henrietta				941.8706639165096
the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly 30293m then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbé busoni				3602.8407861701053
will it be the same this evening				107.3272755506754

he reflected but he remembered that he himself would have charge of the food and the wine and therefore that no powder could be mixed with the food no drug with the wine				485.41224144509715
he has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith in his queen				757.4519174986883
no replied the young man				1.5408874753665787
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative				266.6134066691077
come grimaud order dinner for yourself and when you have rested a little we can talk no sir no said grimaud				69.85757527464722
thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse				141.00916418800782
the evening was employed in discussing the war the grooms polished their arms the young men loaded the pistols in case of a skirmish and they awoke in despair having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to participate in the battle				790.0432330730089
in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar				31700.994045018484
there only remained in the closet of the wounded duke laporte and patrick				3165.783541930685
call for help useless said athos useless				695.5265268359792
a year after madame well i wanted to see the good curé again				196.93620216433962
and i also said franz				60.6345917390142
and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you i hope that i remain your friend as well as that of what the devil are their names d artagnan and porthos d artagnan and porthos ah yes				62.15323754814046
it was winter s				558.0327157812549
hush cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord				18.610547056058056
you are free he said through me your liberty was my ransom agreed but the ransom of that immense treasure buried under the gallery to which one descends on pushing a spring hidden in the wall which causes a tub to turn revealing a staircase must not one speak of that a little my lord diavolo cried mazarin almost choked and clasping his hands i am a lost and ruined man but without listening to his protestations of alarm d artagnan slipped him gently down into the arms of athos who stood immovable at the bottom of the wall				161.3435831692558
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count that eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship				186.75655921165344
happy on the contrary for what am i in want of				351.93776003742033
i have a hundred pounds weight less upon my chest				6745.927440562361
what object think you have this expedition to ré and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting				6895.372964152597
we will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the baroness who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser lucien debray				123.35546567415074
i have the note said he to athos and to his friends				48.867309612193786
oh what a dreadful event cried maximilian				154.4826786637839
here s a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond you are right d artagnan i held a similar project but as i had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me				9.098665341938466
the little company started off at a trot on the road to cambrin where they expected to find the prince				416.22189885087244
at that time i was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me				12.39327194067977
you have purchased it dearly enough d artagnan left athos s chamber and went to that of porthos				56.45987649191938
aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript ps				21607.62590099518
has not m danglars informed you of the ceremony oh yes said the count i received a letter from him yesterday but i do not think the hour was mentioned possibly my father in law trusted to its general notoriety well said monte cristo you are fortunate m cavalcanti it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and mademoiselle danglars is a handsome girl yes indeed she is replied cavalcanti in a very modest tone				16.397883650593055
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt				5856.7280565607125
the young officer stood upright before her awaiting her words as if to devour them				15.529280084750537
then i shall recognize you as my nephew for you would be a worthy son of such a mother no replied mordaunt forcing his features and the muscles of his body to resume their usual places and be calm no i shall not kill you at least not at this moment for without you i could not discover the others				198.99195346108988
ratonneau and pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the château d if but ratonneau and pomègue are inhabited as is also the islet of daume				9107.50168585796
does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him there will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs				5794.940929925389
intact my dear friend besides the harness of your bucephalus and mine but what is the use of harnesses without horses i have an idea about them athos you make me shudder listen to me				4.863307696755066
ah then madame i was able for one instant to be alone with you				8.073149295977208
as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure				3515.9995007850703
albert ran to fetch a carriage				100.81546237166131
i have therefore as you see great need of hearing from you				13.654761612607377
eat heartily grimaud smiled and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it				9.47974962998099
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomas du louvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious				9046.076809932456
yes sir come nearer said the magistrate with a patronizing wave of the hand and tell me to what circumstance i owe the honor of this visit do you not guess monsieur asked morrel				23.007579995449085
we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again why said dantès if in two or three days you hail any fishing boat desire them to come here to me				7.677293956225452
at length a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the lips and the sufferer made a feeble effort to move				1076.4109754082856
useless to look everything will come to us when wanted				9161.983679903125
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots				30413.194898459304
as to that said aramis we are witnesses				1658.9828955004543
as to d artagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate				943.5788629983997
was this love a simple political affair or was it naturally one of those profound passions which anne of austria inspired in those who approached her				16.192246992903307
he could no longer cherish any doubt that the cardinal had been carried off by the three prisoners since the prisoners had disappeared at the same time and he had hastened to saint germain to warn the queen of that disappearance				1087.8282875348289
and what do you know about the state you talk of said mme				38.92160785182211
he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running				9433.777943375868
where is he ill very ill say you				12.04090809524376
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries				11210.423185331083
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe				1611.628163866069
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions				4724.454544200773
and what may be that description dark complexion hair eyebrows and whiskers black blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his button hole a hat with wide brim and a cane ah ha that s it is it said noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the rue coq héron didn t i say that your police were good for nothing yes but they may catch him yet true said noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance at these words he rose and put off his frock coat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his son s toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers				13940.863840671958
d artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive				7211.549117710458
that s love or i don t know what love is come said danglars you appear to me a good sort of fellow and hang me i should like to help you but yes said caderousse but how my dear fellow replied danglars you are three parts drunk finish the bottle and you will be completely so				314.8289322056191
you are too charming said d artagnan sorrowfully and you abuse my love no i use your generosity that s all				77.18508108814137
quite certain said milady with a last doubt				1326.9958068438427
yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition and villefort s father extended his hand to the bell rope to summon the servant whom his son had not called				966.5375689901173
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man				832.6855709326506
are you displeased with me cried valentine in astonishment				33.451537247013
in reality when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of other men or rather other men are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his strength and resources doubled philosophy m bertuccio interrupted the count you have done a little of everything in your life oh excellency no no but philosophy at half past ten at night is somewhat late yet i have no other observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive				13560.409284514906
the center of the most animated group was a musketeer of great height and haughty countenance dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract general attention				1238.49725639297
gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it				17.12126575749912
i enclose a draft for 5 000 livres payable on m ferrea banker at nice and also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo whom i have directed to supply all your wants				5301.497617190451
my letter of recommendation cried d artagnan my letter of recommendation				2303.9693649869837
one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude				3745.5006990378433
let us try and overtake this gentleman said raoul to olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company it was about four o clock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them				49.09137873472769
but said d artagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ah yes said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment				4867.56366085038
but as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may stop at châtellerault let us give him only half the sum promised him with the letter with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply				921.4299719699005
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive				3574.6805277105345
at length they arrived at the famous room				7.349090568349123
with whom with a child seven years old dear friend at raoul s age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real				2712.3456053391337
it is needless to say that this caution concerned blaisois alone long enough since it had been a useless one to grimaud				706.4983411840539
at the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat				1173.4140022662466
madame danglars turned very pale then exclaimed i can not believe it the thing is impossible i assure you madame replied the woman it is as i have said turning impatiently towards her husband madame danglars demanded is this true is what true madame inquired danglars visibly agitated				320.33160587575657
however it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies apprised in time of the visit paid him monte cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants				1054.5232414341824
he resides in a quiet quarter continued aramis his tastes and his profession require it				55.80760724118389
the inn was full of disreputable looking people who seemed as if they were on the point of commencing some nightly expedition				2678.0321312731235
rise and answer peppino glanced anxiously at franz				67.80223594091066
at eleven o clock came in his turn duhallier captain of the guards bringing with him fifty archers who were distributed immediately through the hôtel de ville at the doors assigned them				97.47138515460844
the breakfast consisted of a piece of bread the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table				136.951807926651
this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men				361.6005403999669
young man said he to d artagnan a suggestion what you may get into trouble by what has taken place you believe so yes				233.2916951977448
our duty is fulfilled not yet said aramis we have still a word to say to these gentlemen and turning to chatillon sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something i can not say before the queen chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor				145.1143273694161
and as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the rhône from which it had its source and the post road it had depleted not a hundred steps from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description				15414.42097006564
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview				1451.3433100421303
it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever				2055.802955972072
ali mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared				205.24784998268086
who is there answered the voice of her he sought				1562.8586460330127
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m de morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society of which he is the brightest ornament said beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne				2587.5545838588046
yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cæsar spada but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune				823.8345389402439
men were giants in those times said athos now we are pigmies in comparison				6799.38107259786
have you been working all night				1211.008583881817
was he the man that stabbed you yes said the executioner				208.7364725251945
never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends during this conversation dantès after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up that s all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that 0075m oh to be sure responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers				738.3576230608433
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief				1387.08287784764
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d artagnan they attracted his admiration				1182.4982220956988
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another				435.34485903631906
are there any others yes the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons let us visit them said the inspector with an air of fatigue				1033.510711608563
you should have allowed me to sleep				1267.053283142621
he must be made to speak in order that he might be spoken to for milady very well knew that her greatest seduction was in her voice which so skillfully ran over the whole gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial				6196.411993248003
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be patient				1354.6972475973269
but you my friend are you not going to change your dress no i shall go as i am				206.36434044344065
he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow				1296.07550856998
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul				1663.8606375376794
finally he promised that he would leave her mistress s presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid				3513.807245067435
everything was in readiness				17019.629785311874
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian				19376.174446813042
your arrival here without waiting my visit at your house today looks well sir said albert				56.828047768736916
morrel looked around uneasily				53.23589441180447
when they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say have you found anything however as porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to act				897.2927816756927
d artagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head				12.590286522925757
a terrible battle between the two men seemed imminent but by degrees carlini s features relaxed his hand which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt fell to his side				86.01364275947877
parry knew this room as he had often been to see me when the king was at newcastle				4298.810500227673
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate				2053.393852150917
at the same time he was a man of elegant manners and strong mind so that in addition to the revolution he had made in war by his new contributions to its methods he had also made a revolution at paris among the young noblemen of the court whose natural chief he was and who in distinction from the social leaders of the ancient court modeled after bassompierre bellegarde and the duke d angouleme were called the petits maitres				2251.4341258683107
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat				1899.8532714987389
think for a moment				51.15130415058447
then with his knife he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced				714.231433596769
my english horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth				500.3499294598947
but tell me what didn t he speak of me in any way ah				50.73171929074385
i dislike these quarrels among men of the church gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet				1628.9352476584575
whence have you these ideas of death you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your son challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live				362.3482556512571
come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife s room nothing is changed here he then closed the door of the landing				6776.128974322036
tis done they both exclaimed at once				55.79922536132881
but what are you looking for i am looking for the person who let down the ladder				397.25489701537634
try therefore either to carry me to some place where i may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here				155.75920133588193
for that night madame that night you loved me i will swear it my lord yes it is possible that the influence of the place the charm of the beautiful evening the fascination of your look the thousand circumstances in short which sometimes unite to destroy a woman were grouped around me on that fatal evening but my lord you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered				1844.2814246014989
indeed the carriage crossed the fatal spot without stopping				7772.545863090012
that will do me great honor said the leader of the posse and i accept thankfully then to yours monsieur what is your name boisrenard monsieur boisrenard to yours my gentlemen				791.2594733658068
moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the wolf				1695.0939893790278
it was forty eight hours since i had taken any nourishment				13638.719242141826
we can find out his well that s all very sensible athos said d artagnan				1.0113236908633898
my young man said d artagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed				1237.797638679856
you see monsieur what the new world has to do with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe				432.3740693353447
to prison with him				5.3462234233794765
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles				31921.121258748815
a small vessel with an english crew whose captain is on my side awaits you at the mouth of charente at fort la pointe				2184.42183123858
this adjoins the lower part of the governor s apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lock up cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured				13173.492084401607
listen then ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them listen continued the abbé				22.824430125396113
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of d artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost				128.70659574047687
i hope i shall gain renée s favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me				26.81678956650682
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father				140.95464438069308
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales				1514.380215628153
on my honor they are not poisoned				1332.3864597539296
the pont du gard inn chapter 27				1724.232902955753
have you not hit upon any asked danglars				63.18850840574722
three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps the second to go to the charge no faster than a walk the third to let the enemy fire first				885.1149179200825
the cemetery of père lachaise m de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth				340.1647650451408
no fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts				2840.5680773230692
his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said julie				208.47476459441745
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look				671.0783260204854
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse d artagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st germain				475.7580196029912
a kind of steward appeared just as d artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount				2568.022920294658
have you anything nothing the devil said aramis				4.218265556247277

still though not actually received at the hôtel danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess				28460.957888606074
d artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it				8.007216891504797
i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something				1415.151018690358
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people				1529.291847406578
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door				28.330090898579154
yes my lord it is i i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly and d artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking				1865.8592959924035
my letter is private and confidential and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels				5614.191266657273
at ten o clock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented				10017.506972822737
the several members of that group were much excited				1332.1196472956003
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret				2286.054994154745
la ramee continued my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to morrow en tete a tete grimaud made a sign which meant that he didn t see what that had to do with him				17.29375773063944
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion				1741.3503806163726
i was saying it was very interesting what was all you were showing me				5.156022496253728
the sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty room				3.8633943731060088
i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops that s well said monte cristo i remain here a day or two arrange accordingly as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter				10055.63068113978
the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton				15992.07667829338
we are four of us said d artagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time				139.5138329565598
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy				851.3808412311987
are the half of the sum mother the other will be paid in a year mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her cheeks				137.7179966382982
winter s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp				255.08075982023314
a wax light placed on the mantle piece threw some of its pale rays without and a shadow was seen for one moment on the balcony				1247.5117544673494
oh very shortly madame said he but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day				158.25837964027372
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar				5189.065443710435
little flirtations perhaps and that s all				258.3249509533635

hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family				431.6975302592035
it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him				4.645118060713631
by demanding my head of the cardinal cried d artagnan pale with terror				82.19173554270424
it was only poisoned to the abbé adelmonte				10855.478426510213
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastile where he remained for twelve long years when his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court				89.53433925572158
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn				25729.748668818353
that s it said the tutor				5490.695876029548
oh then you were glad to hear that m morrel i didn t dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old man s being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor				226.89288957839628
ten minutes afterward she was at home				63.692058656422425
can all this force be summoned on my account thought he				13.429452682414828
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips				118.72639133177461
one day the young shepherd told the count s steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his flock				3074.9385356993444
the blows which he received increased greatly his esteem and friendship for monsieur de tréville				7.588208979630256

the apparition chapter 101				2163.5358920218705
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest				116.23713835180287
he started and the prisoner saw that start for though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her				11.4134776010164
his name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the palais royal				2.7629060301362416
the swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only				2101.554497276928
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs				136.17221923373071
during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also refreshed				4225.803465929432
it was said athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man				205.80352259553737
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense				10877.064306611626
ay and observe it just occurs to me that the puritans are furious against buckingham and their preachers designate him as the antichrist well said milady				37.86311477174475
to have to make a false excuse to porthos				228.70492865040805

i gave her good advice by which she did not profit				13582.308254217925
felton mounted the ladder first and gave his hand to milady while the sailors supported her for the sea was still much agitated				469.2100648456586
at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance				9706.115935409138
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you and has he found consolation he has at least found peace and does he ever expect to be happy he hopes so maximilian the young man s head fell on his breast				234.77535747489964
he can not pardon her the history of the saraband				19568.52383525889
an instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared				94.55123754899839
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour				977.926144875222
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind				61.062122434509845
it was only to fight as an amateur				4903.981643180261
well said renée i can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician for instance				6113.076381042637
to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me				21.21836391628479
planchet art thou there cried mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears				338.829378894817

the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself				26.3074560715948
yes my son and a sacred command say it my father the house of thomson french is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishness it is not for me to read men s hearts has had any pity for me				5.483615156735426
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the world				55.418240506860634
but amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme				472.4127749092722
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars				881.2749679288972
the will chapter 60				1963.3790176711943
they fetch a doctor who opens the dead body and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon				14820.143764141001
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it				19.380201332579865
my faith said d artagnan to athos you had a triumphant idea				230.40802544236746

the artist who could have depicted the expression of these two countenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture				5504.867949662242
it is you who sent by him to constantinople to treat with the emperor for the life or death of your benefactor brought back a false mandate granting full pardon				1359.375670468477
monte cristo drew him in gently				11232.275667446967
come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed				926.8417303711404
it was a name that too often resounded in her majesty s ears and too often vibrated in her heart for anne of austria not to recognize it yet she remained impassive looking at him with that fixed stare which is tolerated only in women who are queens either by the power of beauty or by the right of birth				4033.0090072554303
d artagnan picked it up and offered it to lord de winter				2.194755094497766
have you any money d artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket				98.92592312746059

oh nothing but a scratch said d artagnan				1.017592311381963
i slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for to night and even for all day to morrow if you want it				25.97321391715819
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead				262.2408767370327
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection				3656.556141831834
he knows how as you must have observed to obey an order for you did not i am sure come from portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak				517.095263408252
well i take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait together but i shall not be allowed to go i am almost a prisoner as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me well well				79.13447228905821
he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces				537.091555981832
the masks could not appear the carriages could not move about but the masks were visible behind the windows the carriages and the doors				1862.7923163072642
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual				4285.355999943221
in that case commanded comminges silence that old woman ah				104.2318650721455

ah i would give much to have five hundred louis only so would i said porthos unwilling to be behind d artagnan in generosity i would give as much as a hundred pistoles the two prisoners were at this point of their conversation when comminges entered preceded by a sergeant and two men who brought supper in a basket with two handles filled with basins and plates				1663.351358743169

go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have arms				1188.129315534818
we have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room				189.30528874315797
he was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal s bodyguard but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings the house was now being searched				7632.787830433346
i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherd s life was vampa s reply				182.61912615772908
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian				5684.683323046978
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host				45.53733171892713
in a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the count				82.15654859466702
as they went from the hôtel des gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit paris by the barrière de la villette and the other by the barrière montmartre to meet again beyond st denis a strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate results				1236.754555484131
is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward athos was seized with a kind of vertigo				525.1539329968343

monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt				4717.705488586914
he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie				4000.532584663686
are you a man				114.75985419382776
d artagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends				68.01125163700266
he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains his opinion of me is altered for the better then no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine				4071.184942924389
here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm eaten table which with the stool and the goat skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell				1093.4740789728883
why was not m de saint méran also grandfather to mademoiselle danglars albert albert said madame de morcerf in a tone of mild reproof what are you saying				779.7986011412148
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their masters				1938.1727430065184
during this time dantès at the opposite side of the table had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests				264.8858485737801
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetano s description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself				34.10029157727042
it is only the dead who do not return you think so porthos replied the musketeer with a sad smile which d artagnan alone understood				350.28579893144376
at length d artagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a woman s torn glove				124307.73201653083
the usurper converted decidedly my dear duke in what way converted to good principles				8580.120981981827

he was in fact in the unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice the finger of god once pointed at him everyone was prepared to raise the hue and cry				1465.8963362407842
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no no said morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first i do signified the old man				1.7632079647472791
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn				490.03349378836
i did not wish to contradict them besides i might be deceived monsieur you insult the majesty of justice not at all said athos calmly				114.67036430029093
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library				19232.943265755817
m de morcerf went out about half an hour ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation i am ready my son said mercédès				331.905279212804
his person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical				5412.694484179716
it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister				726.9492713820766
general quesnel it appears had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared				25.50152004504889

tell haydée said he that i will take coffee with her and give her to understand that i desire permission to present one of my friends to her ali bowed and left the room				10.612528896477578
the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs élysées and made monte cristo raise his head				27.915601449002843
mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed				1196.629412811248
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient				1247.9377469146384

as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already two thirds gone				997.4261092379794
porthos completely used up by three nights without sleep and a journey of seventy leagues on horseback retired to his cabin and went to sleep				326.6070613380175
a fanatic has just assassinated him ah said rochefort with a smile this is a fortunate chance one that will delight his eminence				234.54943997038546
but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty				335.4092695164931
in five minutes he had arrived at the place where the guards joined him coming up one by one				460.65501472628307
oh yes said the count you are looking for the sailors yes i paid them nothing and yet they are gone never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling				2.227719778244441
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine				10668.707366553941
the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet				1295.9605625124445
let us go and have a game at tennis la ramee my lord i beg your highness s pardon but i must beg for half an hour s leave of absence why because monseigneur mazarin is a prouder man than his highness though not of such high birth he forgot to ask me to breakfast well shall i send for some breakfast here no my lord i must tell you that the confectioner who lived opposite the castle daddy marteau as they called him well well he sold his business a week ago to a confectioner from paris an invalid ordered country air for his health well what have i to do with that why good lord				54.996438511666945

how can it be effected someone must be sent to the duke but who who				18505.809639545172
but in his present condition he will promise anything and take his chance of keeping it afterwards i will do more than i promise said dantès				58.83643999072301
we could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us aha				17721.259405690824
the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters				1368.3490328393386
morrel had to pay within half an hour 287 500 francs				122.97231720435141
but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody s professions of friendship				231.88672733224584
prepare yourself maximilian he said with a smile we leave paris tomorrow have you nothing more to do there asked morrel				14.2276821510825
it was at this moment d artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor s carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them				7.366625166104818
he felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress				476.81090173096953
well but he is a charming young man according to my ideas he is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of m noirtier to prevent his granddaughter marrying old men are always so selfish in their affection said madame de villefort				2.4738631843590237

teresa had a great desire to see this ball				2360.178113020734
monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together				335.9445207999348
the favorite the confidant the first man in short at the court he had been obliged to yield his place to mazarin and so became the second in influence and favor and eventually as he was stupid enough to be vexed at this change of position the queen had had him arrested and sent to vincennes in charge of guitant who made his appearance in these pages in the beginning of this history and whom we shall see again				639.6275165849888
he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio				176.03736234238215
what do you say to it why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence and shall we go and find him inquired franz				42.94049053277917
my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us				103.3984876590453
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard				5754.4358459302575
oh if you know him tell me by a man of from forty to forty five years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left temple that is he that is he but his name ah his name				54.50020535701842

i did go to monsieur d artagnan s what was the aim of that visit to beg him to assist me in finding my wife				177.96115296941025
monsieur de beaufort escaped my lord i saw him run off from the top of the terrace and you did not fire on him he was out of range monsieur de chavigny where was he absent and la ramee was found locked up in the prisoner s room a gag in his mouth and a poniard near him but the man who was under him was an accomplice of the duke s and escaped along with him mazarin groaned				746.7569935641582
yes madame replied the officer				57.67824939445376
she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world				81.24164910943924
about fifty paces off another man also appareled as a cavalier was talking to a scotch sentinel and though a foreigner he seemed to understand without much difficulty the answers given in the broad perthshire dialect				1925.115566763188
my dear monsieur de rochefort how much you must have learned during your intimacy with the late cardinal				282.4617783080253

god s death don t fire screamed d artagnan throwing open the window				40.322280510104164
do you refuse said mercédès in a tremulous voice				3.0012659715683028
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen				71.12586306941581
at one end was the receipted bill for the 287 000 francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel nut with these words on a small slip of parchment julie s dowry				7421.461686192942
he shall not come in before i am gone said he and when i am gone you can open to him but i ought to be gone too				428.6735391331501
i have made up the loss of blood by nutrition				8123.448789869049
in strafford s company said mordaunt tauntingly				4209.296505017633
m de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france				172.33755290725148
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father s honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms				56.18832161065293
here it is the hostler enchanted with the good day s work he had done returned to the yard				887.7088671915482
as he gazed at him mazarin shook his head slightly as much as to say this is a man who does not appear to me fit for much after a pause which appeared an age to rochefort mazarin took from a bundle of papers a letter and showing it to the count he said i find here a letter in which you sue for liberty monsieur de rochefort				11.078525052565181
she passed her finger slowly down the columns and when she came to the word will m noirtier s eye bade her stop				1903.160945994236
cocles remained in m morrel s service and a most singular change had taken place in his position he had at the same time risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a servant				286.0383870703741
insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of anything wrong i sought not to shake it off				323.86749712545344
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never				1347.5992565791287
we will go on gentlemen said the queen				8.075053136534754
what has happened then sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen				32.59944840686107
you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw				1102.815693998448
on the landing d artagnan blushed in the antechamber he trembled				2917.6304295518435
the horse neighed with pleasure at seeing him				5.437194294337855
what does this mean monsieur cardinal asked the king in a severe tone				15.47064030208509
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard				1908.3816688193174
d artagnan cried she is it you				348.2114485417159
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me and you you would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis				4.752581410824091
0319m you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse				645.9217261351076
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock				1203.2270928193266
thanks to what aramis had told him d artagnan who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate de bracieux and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon				1252.5365162738026
for a moment d artagnan thought that parry s brother had disappeared but he was mistaken				268.240929333428
you who love and are beloved you who have faith and hope oh do not follow my example				216.71082928491387
why the devil do you rouse me at this hour to tell you that you are free your excellency my dear fellow replied albert with perfect ease of mind remember for the future napoleon s maxim never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my life				85.16930621892968
a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot				483.54147160616486
this is quite another man and does not resemble him at all				29.937110754176356
porthos murmured d artagnan look well at that priest yes said porthos i see him				12.79121676549321
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him				9.940357287124737
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly				1412.7144039127704
let him have it let him have it she said				6.059653078664199
but as we have said d artagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty				1789.9842519139538
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his hand				27.09079757986062
d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week				950.0847302451172
on their side the three musketeers were much attached to their young comrade				348.15383737341216
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes				21.13648794565078
i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her				25.857302092533036
but what the devil are you about aramis continued athos				4.614806477474258
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down				121.74799768822626
he s a fine looking fellow said another if he had only a comb and hair grease he d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids his coat looks nearly new and his boots are brilliant				1169.0081826534529
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped				152.5780978998873
at the hotel de ville				29.121504533220943
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg™ s goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come				341.2425248335315

in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the one with green the other with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbage leaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate				3399.1086051745747
they had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries				11943.486672896177
the abbess introduced them to each other				256.22373442406456
there is nothing compromising in the name of a town				1641.082653892991
none for a moment dantès was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal spada				2613.3549159928857
now m danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught sterlets said château renaud are only found in the volga and said cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size exactly one comes from the volga and the other from lake fusaro impossible cried all the guests simultaneously				2126.2722061464274
he delayed presenting himself at morrel s but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him				2.5529122321039828
at present i confess that is the thing i stand most in need of buckingham gave d artagnan a chamber adjoining his own				485.80959380112427
the door closed but this time a fresh inmate was left with dantès hope				931.7706284204019
you are not joking are you no on the honor of an officer there is the half pistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him				224.87302887765424

at length one by one all the noises in the neighborhood ceased				2133.723095176691
the one was a little billet genteelly folded with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch				8934.771387287428
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child				339.46735836397534
the king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow				3067.850092952675
he was a foreigner an italian from the neighborhood of mantua i believe let me see this diamond again replied the jeweller the first time you are often mistaken as to the value of a stone caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller				481.59569256794254
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant i shall borrow from the queen but her majesty has no property interposed aramis				26.207504702871397
i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this much desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti				306.2646613631879
danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor				587.7508866410514
what said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated no returned the count				34.219598266649115
god save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were renewed				10085.297239096431
ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor				1724.6012781873233
so he cherishes no resentment you are mistaken porthos said d artagnan				1.0108972791428517

edmond if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead				292.4543209951306
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection				5634.638278127291
but dress yourself see m de morcerf sets you the example albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots				872.3956912885228
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès inquired the abbé of caderousse				158.43921790657203
this order i believe i have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier but also with the courtesy of a gentleman				247.47383403438332
to my misfortune to my eternal misfortune and milady twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief				543.113056195131
villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lying no doubt asleep on the sofa				6306.590948352666
this mystery required an explanation at least so d artagnan declared to himself				39.98674755421827
on the twenty eighth of october 1628 the capitulation was signed				1613.2520200225918
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger				630.2096559645681
my faith said d artagnan it appears that i was more drunk than you since i remember nothing of the kind athos did not trust this reply and he resumed you can not have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or gay				4178.870239027931

he is to bring us five fresh horses one for his eminence four for us				175.46380547634053

and since when have you become afraid of a quarrel i am always afraid of a quarrel when i am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it				6.637626438750523
at the end of a passage paved with bricks was a little garden bathed in sunshine and rich in warmth and light				1644.381194871104
i have two horses i do not count my servant s bobtailed nag				13669.762959299454
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair				376.5117333838954
at whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that i shall be ready to give you absolution thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice				4.485711172831397
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenant s sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal				4909.531467565215

her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband				241.98514567716273
do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat aramis rushed after the fugitive hat				425.7681701631616
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness thanks my captain replied d artagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general				1018.0690199648913
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saint méran s				13.46329056769998
around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies				1155.5238111028184
in my opinion a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle danglars broken contract and m danglars disappearance				1496.0657107660902
you are mad dear friend judge not rashly say the gospel and the cardinal replied athos				4.76419175287817
the scotch my brothers				1685.9326901093607
he still doubts thought milady i have not been earnest enough someone was heard in the corridor milady recognized the step of lord de winter				3.3316179962722217
consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz d épinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my daughter s hand on whomever i please what said the count the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech				3659.291100466575
to attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirty six degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit				7034.678667018442
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do				478.9451285540278
they breakfasted in haste and at six o clock had already gone ten miles				14817.26079213401
now i have these proofs albert and i am in your confidence no human power can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal but i come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me				15.025016197486854
dantès was beside himself with joy				27.22617844198032
there let us dine then said porthos it is getting cold the friends at ease with regard to the future did honor to the repast the remains of which were abandoned to mousqueton bazin planchet and grimaud				545.1451521952984
he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder				323.7044579251274
d artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army				899.7898326132696
do you not recognize me unhappy child silence be silent said andrea who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the walls for heaven s sake do not speak so loud you wish to speak with me alone do you not said bertuccio				211.76937675993503
valentine instantly ran down				71.18978849530663
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends				2796.217132174604
come to our house tomorrow				169.4891068090579
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends				82.91208886346837
grimaud said athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their hands oh the great man cried d artagnan				1.0145012143355867
they descended into the plain by the ladder				415.1412453480811
this was a great matter in the way of honor but very little in the way of wealth so that when the illustrious companion of the great henry died the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto				7348.273936181268
madame morrel looked again through the keyhole morrel was writing but madame morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper				1068.264497399488
34 oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge				29406.66620559079
well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly				908.2949983317687
for you know athos				121.80199985259038
have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you				16.011559013242692
monsieur du vallon i commend his eminence to your care be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which d artagnan took and shook in his				443.1909946717511
my friends said athos this is what i expected from such hearts as yours				676.0131059661413
i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity				16241.715610984904
but we must say farewell edmond and let us part before i leave you mercédès have you no request to make said the count				7.555407461141391
it was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it				17.521289278442868
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard				346.4958448285267
d artagnan had not been deceived these two men had only followed for the purpose of assassinating him hoping that the young man s death would be placed to the account of the enemy				519.6855390353445
who art thou cried he clasping his hands				9.703442565852638
the principal charge against you is this letter and you see villefort approached the fire cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed				1751.8850966499565
i returned to the seminary				2804.058814403343
hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second and if you move i will blow your brains out and he levelled his carbine at dantès who felt the muzzle against his temple				16840.574492610885
pardon me madame for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger and i in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me				4.2024933555076105
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminence s commands and d artagnan unsealed the letter and read m				84.16585578086239
let me go on captain				305.41953719595233
come caderousse no nonsense said he				6.8064723700523
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband				281.16770368344754
what was it then				93.89478211422198
they turned round and saw diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his arms				78.75772750930638
it was the first time franz had ever seen a guillotine we say guillotine because the roman mandaïa is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument 7 the knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex side falls from a less height and that is all the difference				464.7947175391606
stop cried the soldiers and ran for their arms				219.29253365458717
he is a worthy honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody				905.7194937803425
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination				554.7011332538494
i will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will say m de la trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it				19.239357592101506
accept that which the bearer brings you make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black eyes				175.03194333349444
i will try and gain a little sleep for you are saved go said valentine whatever happens i promise you not to fear monte cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl who gradually fell asleep yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count had given her				17.202248171642132
well then the frenchman took off his mask teresa with the chief s consent did the same				120.79386558431764
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscount s age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert				304.0508733730156
these undertakings do not suit me as you know aramis why because it is taking people unawares really athos you would make a singular general				993.7488308263618
bring me a carafe of water said the abbé				16.476120155735142
my dear m de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you on the contrary what can you mean asked the procureur alarmed				106.88437946463553
i did hope man is a poor wretched creature i did hope				294.866432855057
we listen monsieur athos yes the wager said the light horseman				147.00520954133958
la mazzolata chapter 36				2036.486628997256
the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes				26.284246682032844
he drew back terrified				13012.543451422946
not here he said doubtless she is in her bedroom he rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shuddering				484.36623330682045
you see it makes a very respectable appearance pardieu cried d artagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinal s money you are an amiable and charming young man said mme				32.75450838358641
gentlemen i have not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the red dovecot				4651.381662568356
get your clothes together				324.597546889173
mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business				1077.9904468024383
on quitting the study they left the kitchen on the right and entered the reception room				4.070312520333388
however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him				550.6248657624461
he knew what were the rights of the great land owners				2997.2064293406584
since god himself dictated those words to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god edmond continued mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since i first knew you i have adored your name have respected your memory				1787.7792335273803
without doubt aramis is one of my best friends aramis				152.72134675905363
and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity curiosity that is a terrible word why so				30.566895699623107
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it				11.402932440790337
now sir said madame de villefort i must bid you farewell				881.1871453530011
it matters little now to me				17.028837781659554
the procureur then told his wife to come up				91.31387344615094
ten minutes later the curate of st sulpice was announced				232.62253402416243
you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo smiling				2.5862942728903073
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten				308.56827463894354
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word				39.96989573050279
yes the marechal de grammont is right this will change the aspect of french affairs but i much fear it will do nothing for english even if it does not harm them				28.43434761444584
how sire cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more i shall have fourteen in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majesty s shoulder				287.5415628955374
albert rejoined his mother she was very pale				402.8086854618846
40162m rise said he				79.50331367514394
as a reply he wrote the following letter do not depend upon me madame for the next meeting				3613.5079503954926
exactly opposite the other				87.68251072521845
to the boats my lads as quick as you can now continued penelon you see m morrel a sailor is attached to his ship but still more to his life so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get along save yourselves we soon launched the boat and all eight of us got into it				14.104466602759425
let him follow me i will take him to his cell go said the gendarmes thrusting dantès forward				69.25737829798905
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy you alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone yes that s true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more i don t doubt				2036.0982370396212
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you				7.011446991267868
you are poor are you not then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me you are not then a man of the people said mazarin astonished				30.72697267728473
well then said the gascon take care of yourself for i am not a bad hand at the rapier nor i either so much the better that sets my mind at rest				99.19124091204318
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthy that of being the husband of mercédès nay nay cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet				1378.9463264940885
tell me your wishes and i will comply with them the queen spoke with some impatience				418.49361163743623
monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever i am king sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our side				272.45289697337665
all has gone according to my wishes				1311.6008794866493
a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back				272.72858748841287
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him				6.762892103100745
i have warned you				3.700852625479404
some wine said athos on perceiving the host				51.23427584510723
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove everyone listened eagerly monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak				121.33697431497939
the papers had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galley slave and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains				4430.323284709271
did you not say she was dead three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her but she murdered the woman i loved				524.845765159854
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face				50.05443983752617
she would not be weary thank god				193.61839150731518
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition				3313.4155519096103
can you sir produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted alas no monsieur replied the count all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his court are either dead or gone away i know not where				1333.887957859137
but d artagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to kitty s door				10.197079488136648
the count again refused				996.9991030378427
mademoiselle valentine passed through the room to go to madame de villefort s said he and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the glass as for the decanter master edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke				3522.517290483483
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced felton was hers				887.1397212093842
our game is beaten up				39.68652370488288
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count				7.763531217333182
yes my lord answered the man				226.5926421148127
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given d artagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared				41.26627442789237
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt my faith yes said d artagnan				1.0191767217267587
nonsense said d artagnan you would do as much mr				1271.5381614522935
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach then the coachman s voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows				118.64370831653295
indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it				43.4352355338679
at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats				12255.225949871923
who has displeased you				6.446867879599211
here is my pass countersigned said the latter				88.42804570790864
athos played and that as a rule unfortunately				3784.1945137927523
the oubliettes of cardinal mazarin				142.29080237936128
morbleu cried the latter i should say that i do pledge myself to it				16.91279442633018
well i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother				143.17108008087223
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered				705.4796633056058
but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything was explained to him by this letter dated from villeroy m d artagnan mm				390.7534138534882
ten minutes afterwards general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves				362.7337624595454
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign				836.2946624819189
the baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young officer				58.88668059632947
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it				7.909738567727667
what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures				1039.277413838946
as he passed by m noirtier s room he perceived two figures through the half open door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further				1347.804256912711
good morning benedetto said bertuccio with his deep hollow voice				20.226874254370607
but that s quite enough gentlemen please to understand that s enough				357.29030197415557
the coast owing to the gascon s stratagem was clear				500.148842353838
i could recite you the whole of thucydides xenophon plutarch titus livius tacitus strada jornandes dante montaigne shakespeare spinoza machiavelli and bossuet				3690.2182996467427
m de villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of père lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates				10977.889223121096
but what if i am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my death				595.8050754516262
i was then obliged to come back again				47.99463433859864
they brought him into this room and placed sentinels at the doors and windows				341.0886291548378
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke				3035.537091909158
valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door bell				327.6724884924302
as to my father you will not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary				4279.540298241971
villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word				48.657091957726664
thus then you will take this bag and you will go away without being too malcontent i go away enchanted farewell then or rather au revoir for i hope we shall meet again whenever monseigneur wishes i am always at at his eminence s orders that will be frequently i assure you for i have found something extremely agreeable in your conversation oh				174.88102615568465
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm				3900.1199517392624
bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each				1342.1476947649114
how so returned the count with surprise				37.72660732554946
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them				9.248439917761388
i will even venture to say that i am certain m de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event				665.8842115873804
he jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servant s arms and joined them				39.95597545950814
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief				605.7483142149707
with me you will be as safe as in a temple i give you my word of a gentleman let us go said she i place full confidence in you my friend d artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution and both light as shadows glided through the interior door into the passage ascended the stairs as quietly as possible and entered d artagnan s chambers				22411.04482444695
the latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current				10540.843907837032
you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely i was far from france at that period				3200.313055605142
the host stood at the door				12.136101280590301
in fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that i think monsieur de comminges must be mistaken what				298.15577961689434
ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the door was kept by the three french attendants commanded by myrtho				4453.881398975476
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect				1273.148344473212
it is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind				904.4062337918997
adieu my noble and generous friend adieu i will go and tell valentine what you have done for me and slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the count s hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by monte cristo				1.012142538951325
when he saw luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him				2.200808508415783
i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair it was i said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were sinking yes returned dantès holding out his hand i thank you again i almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot long dantès recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the château d if				1.4958165738912532

totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass				115.56312235010348
the other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay				1923.2346546200436

in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in 1628 the massacre of st bartholomew in 1572 and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generals la rochelle is impregnable except to famine				2497.4469596472186

finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist				686.1923420535568

athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the bill				4967.062398111514

but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter				2267.4612918450143

his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head				16.35891652341955
i heard the name of rochefort				226.91485340642447
she was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with that of the lover of her heart and yet milady at the same time detested and despised this weak fanatic				617.4485593559966

dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea				159.5680799944129
he could not understand how albert s fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation				13113.17636737134
dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous				1918.0583548220459
her lips were cold it appeared to d artagnan that he had embraced a statue				1456.749301590273
he had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the second				257.7933656559389
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head				103.16411480403234

noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary				125.50049752421945
if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost haste				1116.2740683227807

no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed				74.19370058624499
he had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection the conversation he had heard between the doctor and villefort the night of madame de saint méran s death recurred to him these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the death of barrois				1776.1366340631812
and i know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you yes sir he had very good ones but you see that in spite of them he has not killed me and did not even fight yet he considered you the cause of his father s dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my house it is true sir said monte cristo with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal doubtless you made then some apology or explanation i explained nothing and it is he who apologized to me but to what do you attribute this conduct to the conviction probably that there was one more guilty than i and who was that his father that may be said the count turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted i know it and i expected this result you expected my son would be a coward cried the count				8.780070154597645
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hated he was only not precisely loved				1135.5268734555302
for his father s death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercédès				226.35722031153526
he found kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her chamber				192.800835340066
i forgot to ask you where are you taking me to the cardinal what does he want with me i do not know				45.266521108311736

what refreshment can i offer				11979.328342234889
besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second				304.2645079879378
madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself				106.35690843494747
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my father s brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse				1720.0711339557142
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you				6.152306540811

olivain managed in his turn to land after crossing himself repeatedly and the people in the ferryboat guided themselves as well as they were able toward the bank with the aid of a pole which chanced to be in the boat				694.2226963104333
monsieur le prince is led by the coadjutor who is led by madame de guemenee therefore madame i ask you to look not among your friends of to day but among those of other times among my friends of other times said the queen				1493.725517352026
it is not he				125.04716744739511
madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their example				425.41850677160454
wait wait you are going to know me				7.5701749267800755

pray reflect a little				234.83346651478007
to this question de guiche could not respond				3638.9640102641592
madame danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the bank notes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocket book and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of consolation				1303.7473210475866
the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him much more so would be that of the king				42.05040222609083

my first business will be to dispose of this diamond so saying the abbé again drew the small box from his pocket opened it and contrived to hold it in such a light that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of caderousse				107.27012535575733
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champs élysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up				139.71115359005617
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner				436.1537520299152

what a dreadful death what a blow				386.1372863211814
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo				1.0107197765194027
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open				1219.9457393146292
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then at d artagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look				145.58812235106066
yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall				136.8698110224876

tedesco answered the cavalier va bene and advancing toward the door opposite to that by which he came in he opened it and disappeared behind it shutting it as he went				449.4853561521745
you need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain				4283.607191943033
he was a strong minded upright young man				6.3439789453895274
that s wise not for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the master for the masters we may say				630.8990962342064
ah what else is there said danglars for at present i can not say that i have seen anything extraordinary				1565.705775640427
next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault				1240.081564281292
a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and danglars sighed as m cavalcanti had done half an hour before				39.278935811021036
my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me				9.046679853053524

fernand s fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune				359.60285030315583
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends aramis shook his head				4.088140551541021
each person s attention was occupied				1071.3604519977716

just so why he is a second ariosto no his name is the count of monte cristo there is no count of monte cristo said debray				27.921452332736415
the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom				370.45076031815944
it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which villefort left the palais				28118.407882866566
milady smiled and d artagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile				98.19895773956584
are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred				2638.263677217021
you must accomplish loyally the commission with which i deign to charge you and on that condition i pardon everything i forget everything and what is more and she held out her hand to him i restore my love bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious but he loved his wife				185.751732525137
ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan				146.115849316537
i have seen milady where demanded d artagnan				1.046138761580921
therefore tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 5 050 000 francs he stretched himself on his bed and after turning over two or three times fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying				9564.206583565478
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand				14.783503975424686
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo				1.022750615419494
i was sure of it the cursed letter don t be afraid you idiot there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed d artagnan i will go without you				29.682234624702357
four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit				685.8989046132815
i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before in short if i go will you go too i will try you torment me giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then of many things what are they mazarin s face smiling as it was became clouded				982.2584205841987
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag				1630.8471414452915
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franz s curiosity				428.78393338034795
what mean you by that they have eyes cried milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not yes yes said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt				915.9161593492491
the second contained the duke and duchess of orleans the tall young mademoiselle and the abbé de la riviere and the third the duke de longueville and the prince de conti brother and brother in law of condé				16516.895895619175
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself				16.662145977694983
d artagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times				362.2991891377174
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhône				3970.607956092719
let me propose it then said d artagnan				1.0222792617347976
m d avrigny opened the door and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the door				13.99707729484721
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours i have sometimes thought as you do athos she had a son that unhappy woman yes have you ever heard of him never he must be about twenty three years of age said athos in a low tone				12.38750258636295
and how does france appear in your eyes accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes i think it is a fine country said haydée but i see france as it really is because i look on it with the eyes of a woman whereas my own country which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish mind always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous so young said albert forgetting at the moment the count s command that he should ask no questions of the slave herself is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by name haydée turned her eyes towards monte cristo who making at the same time some imperceptible sign murmured εἰπέ speak nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two scenes i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness 40068m speak speak signora said albert i am listening with the most intense delight and interest to all you say haydée answered his remark with a melancholy smile				165.17241381229337
can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished				1403.2118811231844
the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum				611.3711675932565
i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty oh a letter				88.15090359594382
then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock				365.18740207352016
had you been in the army you would have been able to pick up a needle on the floor of a closed oven				14757.93144126996

where were we i recollect you were saying said d artagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france				126.18228233283905
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to milady to be silent his face was much agitated				208.08008922188526
we are mistaken said d artagnan				1.0160832399903428
it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis				4.623614717211504
the mendicant had kept his word and made friquet his heir				899.2125122585519
i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you				5.422096866782603
but make haste i can not stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it				11.353806156775295
the bandage fell from his eyes and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before				383.93501579384355
d artagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others				1242.554549131981

because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands and that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what i see it has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the future then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister we have not thought about it yet madame answered d artagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly i ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants alas madame exclaimed d artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us perhaps said anne but that idea if at last i have it your majesty will do us justice				394.7227999786884

at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes and porthos started				144.92367960757775
the moaning of waves the noise of thunder the roaring of a volcano can not be compared with the tempest of cries heard at that moment				162.974941919706

he was a great man will your eminence be angry if i read you a lesson i				115.01623800988875
then he went out				8.202643043496527
he must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell				1151.8226455112292
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore				494.75889746711414
but replied the owner glancing after dantès who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate				1848.5515566607241
yes madame another service said athos shocked that the queen did not seem to recognize him				4.640838506162277
but what makes you doubt it i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber and that i had found my way into the apartment of some churchman				3645.504619024443
to doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony				6865.549996177164
this was the room appropriated to the sailors				1365.3020878165792
what do you mean by that nothing my lord monsieur d artagnan belongs to the service monsieur d artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he robs you are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you you may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city tis that exactly				8337.317010763698
i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do nothing else besides the same thing had occurred often before				242.34553819648985
the three carbineers looked about carefully on every side saw the young peasants and galloping up began to question them				48.069322415536924
that of the home department or of the observatory oh no i should find there people who would force me to understand things of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in spite of myself a mystery which even they do not understand				215.85669006676983
he was well known at the hôtel of the musketeers where everyone considered him a good comrade				979.0599386228461
the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs élysées				3.4022906293608437
well has anybody come out no but somebody has gone in a man or a woman a man ah				53.64450065143859
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock				578.5296770256715
alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips				118.87628428094297
to saint peter s first and then to the colosseum returned albert				61.169307579973854
get me out of this in heaven s name he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard				205.00224597594138
did none of you charge your purveyor godeau to send me some wine no				251.7777641562011
it is he who has raised all this revolt the more reason said mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal the queen sprang to the window				62.61619343857468
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur				806.8141141097295
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached				650.2667477837459
come in come in monsieur porthos the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity				2581.428417879699
the count of monte cristo cried morrel throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage i should think we would see him				14.536052277311557
curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito and he was recognized				1494.5868925893856
yes replied caderousse little albert but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education herself				129.91141048044832
the baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out				30.407021946401823
take care that the french do not take their revenge on you for the sicilian vespers i will do my best the streets are full of armed men continued d artagnan				1.1263142830623412
he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of				333.4843913482871
they re after me was andrea s first thought				1580.1701036463835
how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry				285.7888954120342
you understand me perfectly on the contrary said danglars but if you will persist i will tell you that i have just lost 700 000 francs upon the spanish loan and pray asked the baroness am i responsible for this loss why not is it my fault you have lost 700 000 francs certainly it is not mine once for all sir replied the baroness sharply i tell you i will not hear cash named it is a style of language i never heard in the house of my parents or in that of my first husband oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny the better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night that noise of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and re counted is odious to me				243.16322586687272
almost immediately bazin came downstairs				219.986698963127
you smile yes why do you do so i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own				73.06172182170964
it is a prisoner said edmond joyfully				66.64105260665649
i have placed reliance upon you my friend				36.15009673582031
but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy				777.3327670237912
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo he bowed to the banker and went out with beauchamp without appearing to notice cavalcanti				898.170328721216
danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment				101.07220777018341
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step				383.8971212463243
adieu thus tis quite decided said d artagnan that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you on the contrary it would tempt me were i any other man rejoined aramis but i repeat i am made up of contradictions				524.1050006249618
after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet				116.04513451597768
bravo said athos that does honor to your imagination all very well said porthos but i should like to understand let us decamp first and you will understand afterward a moment gentlemen a moment give grimaud time to clear away the breakfast ah ah said aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarging				3063.277662326992
left alone the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter which he secured with his special seal				1157.593001119682
ah i m ready to do what you will cried porthos even to swear by mahomet				5617.174298155467
but in a word what are you going to do asked she				42.67395053958009
my dear aramis you have the pen of a secretary of state				2197.650637027893
if that does not suit you you can point out what other hours you prefer and in this respect your wishes will be complied with but am i to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber asked milady				30.723551681233207
but we know very well what had become of edmond				612.2545413312918
ah come in come in monsieur d artagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too				231.67110126928677
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire				1275.9330463657118
everything is best in its time monseigneur				592.0678358005642
in our position one must provide for everything i shall try to gain the coast of france				89.96675319848542
the result was that even if the king s troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other buckingham who only continued in the isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the siege				2685.2773125531753
let us leave them she said				3.5005092861784295
lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near				889.4867808696102
the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals				9932.216003735732
my own service said d artagnan				1.014456033672314
pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my life by such a name				136.37411239585802
i would lay a wager he has stolen it do you think so answered d artagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity				10951.997740342484
although m de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air				296.9436768160664
to whom is it addressed to monsieur noirtier rue coq héron paris had a thunderbolt fallen into the room villefort could not have been more stupefied				656.1285533575896
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerf s defence				43727.641184668995
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning				915.0422173574926
come come said maximilian i will serve as your guide such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant				418.81761200749736
he continued so i was going away but he called me back				505.94985756941924
but this is all i have left in the world he said out of an immense fortune				562.2032297627559
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted				27825.426963602527
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward				1731.797869119874
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand				15.204225046510397
just as my mother was on the point of pushing open a small door we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening tone				361.25723372076925
the enemy cried the king				19.820367518965817
as she went downstairs she gave the keys of valentine s room to m de villefort so that no one could reach the sick room excepting through that of madame de villefort and little edward				680.981576112879
we were able to prove the contrary and that proof we are ready to give to your majesty calling in support of it the august widow weeping in the louvre where your royal munificence has provided for her a home				1753.1720295312546
you see me devoted to you body and soul my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours that were i to lose you i would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another				688.1278488743823
i am giving them the slip said eugénie this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty we will soon alter our direction and the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step				1185.1575480870572
the hour of dinner soon arrived				534.8851441947909
he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish				409.1683878905742
will our help come from you yes you are sure of it yes there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power				740.5423138566603
nevertheless had caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of bellegarde as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist				1242.7696438604041
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of laporte				2249.4585554532478
yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence who are they replied the duke				15.203057851060542
we have arranged the ransom of each of them 2 000 on arriving in france				140.3251313919307
have you lost your heart indeed i fear it replied andrea in the tone in which he had heard dorante or valère reply to alceste21 at the théâtre français				15948.000462277463
scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale when they perceived three cavaliers d artagnan porthos and planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and planchet his musket by his side				86.03997809991407
but mazarin is a low born rogue who can at the most take us by the collar like an archer				6806.835726117222
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know tis true replied d artagnan				1.0182497506763377
and what was this man s name danglars what rank did he hold on board he was supercargo and had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment not if the choice had remained with me for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts good again				267.1120995750754
but what are you doing				362.2401108162521
my friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty paces and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running noose				83614.31946614003
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless				3131.080090297446
aramis related what had been agreed upon				621.8833962025375
valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep				1187.532894232421
m de la trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to life				616.0278416735749
the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother				313.4037556398349
while exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls they excited them secretly to quarrel deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants				2316.2582065302267
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still yes we				5473.610169721983
danglars stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another half hour which appeared to him like a century				546.7086223891804
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty bottle and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass				92.66119138919895
athos killed his adversary first				513.6866185915001
the count advanced accompanied by maximilian and emmanuel				201.43142662322091
d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise which was not quite free from joy				236.60047680202243
monsieur and dear friend ah yes				77.82773896040462
peste returned albert i compliment you on it i have its fellow he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and it cost me 3 000 francs let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself				160.67916282935266
ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag				7373.004148347599
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that				67.27257380640583
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere have i not obeyed				927.2156976760513
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer				5247.164103822439
and what brought you here i came to thank god for my happy deliverance said rochefort				507.4580189461912
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of it				6.223619289460497
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio				1692.678942841757
you have hastened to me can i have the happiness of being useful to you 40286m yes i need your help that is i thought like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me tell me what it is replied monte cristo				183.45621915751133
then he kissed and rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful mistress				359.26795005694515
nevertheless at eight o clock in the morning the regiment of the queen s guards commanded by guitant under whom was his nephew comminges marched publicly preceded by drums and trumpets filing off from the palais royal as far as notre dame a manoeuvre which the parisians witnessed tranquilly delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms				2981.117191624861
his reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of him				7.692640784997107
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations				2913.1554806306917
this malady admits but of one remedy i will tell you what that is				256.80289608318657
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him no sire where did he lodge rue de la harpe				75.85488718285674
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				2305.8003901125126
my drunkenness is always sad and when i am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain				430.90121663978175
morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother in law he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to them				25.013082184280126
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door				8.340582758634657
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor				714.882222594096
my leave is at an end do you return to paris asked athos quickly				48.3043104349791
thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known mousqueton well so far so well answered planchet alighting and extending his arms to mousqueton the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that planchet was a great lord in disguise so highly did they estimate the position of mousqueton				234.48044367538108
when the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ship s bulwarks				12261.7142261056
well then to my health				1708.3407142161682
good morning my dear host cried d artagnan				1.0248887535449536
i confess i am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in italy justice is only paid when silent in france she is paid only when she speaks				6335.635165583779
he and she the queen and the duke cried richelieu				682.319425043118
gentlemen resumed aramis any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have had you arrested for we have friends in paris but we are contented with another course				1513.2570249080345
greece only had risen against turkey and had begun her war of independence all eyes were turned towards athens it was the fashion to pity and support the greeks				7435.155415939632
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot				295.1833822477495
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund				239.96362435064282
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned yes do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him no do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine yes then will she die too asked d avrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier				101.01419766279534
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo				1.0546747443880968
