a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living				351.8209787841483
his majesty i can assure you will be tried on his arrival in london i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis				16.379144116210043
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan				9127.396013681138
at last d artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and d artagnan s blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass				618.4725253791486
on their side the three musketeers were much attached to their young comrade				468.6910590019592

as to dant√®s he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it				6.403279822387423
but doctor you see me already so grieved how can i introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow				2075.505374783421
dear me said the young woman endeavoring to read her husband s inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort what is the matter madame where do you keep the poison you generally use said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door				72.10737160875956
i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours				740.2397534761909
apropos said d artagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain yes in some respects tolerably well olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent				4662.680300918058
come reflect and decide your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied d artagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely d artagnan paused				721.9810016722207
no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released merc√©d√®s and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door				2.9897757747496256
i am going to fight because i am going to fight answered porthos reddening				5804.149838994689
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses danglars took advantage of caderousse s temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint victor staggering as he went				1235.155651004407
take it then but in exchange caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand				21.87114358062986
during the three weeks that he has been with me i have only had to reproach him with one thing being too severe with the prisoners and who is this cerberus a certain monsieur grimaud my lord and what was he before he went to vincennes he was in the country as i was told by the person who recommended him to me and who recommended this man to you the steward of the duc de grammont he is not a gossip i hope lord a mercy my lord				12.582334376018526
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said d artagnan				1.0093785529074986
it was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of arras				433.8116172642906
come said d artagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match				1996.8403101705662
and so my friends we return to paris				163.67874517343776
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion				4824.422252428568
oh take it take it said the count hayd√©e is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know ali left the room				14.331666546666263
i will however inform monsieur d artagnan of your arrival here comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery				1425.2943009018122
is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir				285.84995302806
in the name of heaven explain yourself oh				136.24145431295915
give me anything you like it is of little consequence go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints				2161.9838092755876
yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion and what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment				4.75496209123122
i hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our music paper				1395.6367382754988
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm				3585.4318594984757
i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please and i cried d artagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever well that is perfectly right and turning on his heel was about to re enter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which d artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse				125.08658719628568
on the contrary observed d artagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible how so it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends said porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army				312.0871008110671
you should not speak so to an old friend like me caderousse as you said just now you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are no but i was brought up in corsica you are old and obstinate i am young and wilful				5405.214832723868
to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service a great service what was that why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor what				63.441296460143136
i will not sleep where i must scorn				4123.002774401996
tell me quickly my time is not my own monsieur said d artagnan on quitting tarbes and coming hither it was my intention to request of you in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten the uniform of a musketeer but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble lest i should not merit it it is indeed a favor young man replied m de tr√©ville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to believe				869.2220611109782
well for my part i shall go to bed said d artagnan come porthos porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend				115.23010889515332
then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber				1392.7694230939842
no she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty				141.56335352441292
you will assist me in the work will you not most undoubtedly				11123.533045982034
her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels				1022.5215955708767
i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me it appears to me that this is quite enough				532.9029824810319
d artagnan hits on a plan				291.16055634656914
have you not mentioned that name to me as for de winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright				5099.888487345874
let us not talk about money if you please it is humiliating then you no longer love me said the procurator s wife slowly and sadly				1913.561964823533
i have known persons he continued for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of d artagnan who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward				3228.025998365641
albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departed not however without walking several times to the door of the press room as if he had half a mind to enter				177.0141997205427
porthos was the first who came to himself				63.38695839594193
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order				539.7969273802087
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents				759.9235313583796
i think only that i have known you not a whole year				244.545195096918
in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house				118.57205105039867
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead				4972.143015670737
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls				2392.988382309582
at the lesser gate of the castle he s posted there are you a large party sixty let him know this moment sir and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return				3494.13835150545
the night lamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimney piece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned				747.5864115295273
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter				141.16295499587096
you who have chateau meadows mountains woods you who have forty thousand francs a year you are not happy my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine				259.7032920438142
listen milady said the cardinal the affair is important				2012.8126687833792
my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes and will you go asked kitty				259.66738203461057
make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you				12.088700640189927
as for denying that i am your nephew you will think twice about it now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year ago and how does it concern me what you have learned said de winter				4.642252780207768
when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many well known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant				794.0079754621731
positively these four men must be on my side the same evening the cardinal spoke to m de tr√©ville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp				243.25484303861114
what does this mean monsieur cardinal asked the king in a severe tone				9.89552414299694
no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death				1402.2286435222918
you render me still more unhappy hate you blame you you edmond				264.5788469841743
he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken				4521.7165001054345
both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse				9947.620098050334
he resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was finished				1805.9391506000509
this must be then an affair of importance and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty five				1062.4585345363137
yes sir who is it a woman accompanied by a servant everyone looked at his neighbor				1349.7581432162397
d artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st leu and followed him instinctively				1832.0454651020607
the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report				2104.398373286663
d artagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross but nothing absolutely nothing				183.29559106944032
after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to cardinal de retz more ruinous than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president mol√© whilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes				1124.873552956775
d artagnan hearing the musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of it				175.61355078623347
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his weapon				8745.161004690166
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags				3708.9812978064115
ah sir cried olivain what are you doing				294.3351504815695
this was the gist of his strange story the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struck it was empty				298.4031188333556
everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands				3549.731706845999
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours				5509.116718065393
lean a little to the left				683.4503199998213
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required				675.334903498915
i will be a sailor instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise i will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons				10316.254725391034

approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking something but why mother just to please me albert said merc√©d√®s				899.926281884308
what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family no sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker				489.81973587026084
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths				2502.540758314997
really madame he said did i alarm you much oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our minds villefort forced a laugh				496.77041387980813
richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself she will arrive she says four or five days after having received the money				297.31289956166705
he passes for a very charitable man				319.7896637358213
ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise d armilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine				309.5899146217478
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope				810.1395341329768
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram				7048.169550566457
what is it you edmond back again said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth				1222.4444357813072
whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel				2077.530253568315
what she cried wringing her beautiful hands what				75.93504700746085
she would have taken d artagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache				1505.5586838180961
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become				7235.205061348071
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him				26.20646749629506
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak				157.7401920630283
i come in the name of our master ali tepelini if you come from ali himself said selim you know what you were charged to remit to me yes said the messenger and i bring you his ring at these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view				2032.7940787856112
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved				1042.8595780573241
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought				957.1738741676722
do you know what consoled him				18.060686411541635
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son but villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard				248.16619038581533
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience				1272.506211126964
the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit				290.0951379188741
why it is after one o clock your home is a paradise porthos one takes no note of time				3770.721310501665
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed				4185.271513180355
i would rather do so was edmond s reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed				1455.741044722409
how do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions asked the beadle				37562.62575550893
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife				243.33036616918312
very well come this way d artagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through				1189.1257178232336
what is this rent said he showing d artagnan a place where it had been pierced through				3891.7935778886945
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down				103.48579300339688
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth				352.31437493900336
mind your own business wife replied caderousse sharply				377.6517062054649

when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet				314.89409195357956
five minutes after m de tr√©ville was asking d artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour				78.36524904290586
indeed said d artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy				8626.74094574185
if it is a snare replied d artagnan i shall scent it out be assured				1609.6075497067657
d artagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him				1.51611508172104
this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms				3140.0540037621968
a great age you mean monsieur porthos				64.71144553363435
he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chauss√©e d antin				71.0718562649477
how sir she cried as d artagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me				4.415851862350392
feverish and excited i rang at the door				7.2792878547816615
how will this end he said				12.959654233409646
i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour				280.80996133503436
that of rouen but you will leave the city on your right				1154.0040605063914
as he found himself in the quarter in which aramis lived he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap				1461.2693249012477

bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinalist				5657.68432994469
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rh√¥ne				2039.200641349129
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels				5451.797434708412

this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tr√©ville s house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances				2184.017722585023

the general remark is oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as m villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters				2472.5857700539127
soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god				2200.0653258164543
his presence produced a good effect				766.1707878979407

then disguised in the clothes of the marquis d o he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door				65.63716746603656
mother nanette began by picking up the louis then she picked up friquet				3143.7994718609957
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women				374.1054309753076
lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly				982.29495469409
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified				5004.821392558442
indeed my dear friend said beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair albert remained silent and wrapped in thought				2208.5265917047154
i indeed invited them here today on your account				222.63035823494835

you can come he said and led them back to noirtier				255.42642865914155
i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall see at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port				432.378605143631
we have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame				1031.7085769331713
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal that the baron de chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward mme				282.1416711200674
and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the father in law i must address myself to the banker and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his turn				26.741336105046308
should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it				5.84414314056408
i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus				16513.241896320855
in the meantime follow me the cardinal alighted the three musketeers did likewise				21611.438465314324
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence				863.5140513284229
one would think one was in the cave of ali baba				2065.6991312975674

i have not tried to discover her other name kitty cried milady				41.16328430658335
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen private interests are as nothing before the interests of all				1471.8547537167665
the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation				1387.2039216451296
hold your tongue said he and let me answer				74.01458447277237
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience i reside in my father s house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no				248.44976427128816
his two companions were already on horseback				170.56106737982248
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination				446.1054771546969
but i am really glad to have seen such a sight and i understand what the count said that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion 20175m without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed				9518.518821693744
good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is three quarters empty then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentine s sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest				1763.3023018733145
has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice				312.2417576195963
bonacieux eagerly and looking at d artagnan with disquiet				5279.036457037104
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abb√© seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart				1971.9292820545054
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m de tr√©ville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her				26.284948556511466
i wager that i uttered a thousand extravagances while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed him				2.249480194518104
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy which is the young man asked de winter turning around				274.37499188193186
when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have i ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you				27.31165248918819
my god can you not remember her name yes it was pronounced in my hearing once				1715.6976884840592
another motive had influenced albert s selection of his seat who knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival				699.9802312028702
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons				771.9373314901776
among worldly people manner is contagious				6593.98327725189
franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to m at that letter the old man signified yes m repeated franz				54.33342497786683
in spite of his usual command over himself dant√®s could not restrain his impetuosity				4479.533749478327
let us see what this letter contains we here present the letter verbatim to his eminence monseigneur le cardinal mazarini i have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england				121.08682319973938
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father				145.14228520726436
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions				6131.643551921713
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought				1400.1253604155077
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room				20.569029965018746
the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes				1095.7341126046938
there is an abundance of italian masks at the palais royal from harlequin even to pantaloon chevalier				1766.2467449203202
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs √©lys√©es and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence				3400.9276532216236
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it				5.664721309131025
it had been d artagnan s practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles				994.7330437099378
but why has he waited till now				319.7513916399723
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o clock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since and don t you know where he is not at all is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell				823.8247181257713
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d artagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood				2717.9515839416663
we don t want either rope ladders or gag pears now my lord said athos do not let us disturb you				3.221926821289299
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform no one could have said what caused the count s voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased				664.2864741101515
i shall hear this morning that m danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wife s this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france				89.53562006387938
your advice then is to sell the diamond replied aramis				13.060799821847457
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of act√¶on and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf s remark				6968.992867136576
the next day merc√©d√®s came to implore the protection of m de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent				2684.2403564198576
it was now cromwell s turn to look fixedly at mordaunt and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable				9796.189514916376
charles was impatiently awaiting his return				1257.4100254298614
he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du mus√©e but strange to say he was not there when i returned monsieur morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs monsieur morrel it is his voice said julie				560.6815296034151
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose				1249.9900199849587
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris				73.82058701412252
and to complete the whole hayd√©e was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers				4994.046097405969
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required i know it said athos coolly since here it is and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels				1086.290860510409
do you still wish to do so i have no wishes count only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else so much the better for i must leave you but i carry your word with me do i not ah count i shall forget it no you will not forget it because you are a man of honor morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so again oh count have pity upon me				3.9015950810787237
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying you promise sir that s agreed that i shall find you to morrow at charenton oh don t be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre				1078.989661940753
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved				26514.31522994239
he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary				1170.474575973288
on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out who s there and d artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal louis and rocroy after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost				22580.5063523418
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that i will answer for him no he will not desert said the king he can always be found as tr√©ville says				452.32992263314435
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1 f 3 this work is provided to you as is with no other warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose				1242.8022372187902
tr√©ville understood admirably the war method of that period in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy must live at the expense of his compatriots				6070.11026562902
some of your people have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested edmond dant√®s mate of my vessel i know it monsieur replied villefort and i am now going to examine him oh said morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do				130.18581352543976
dant√®s made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist				6188.716880616183
i asked the price they told me it was 4 500 francs				1002.6285330334069
then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied juxon				17802.61778306255
milady was wrong in fearing that mme				274.52352660981074
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction				675.00104635564
did you see poor barrois die noirtier raised his eyes to heaven				77.06787354386182
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation they are hot royalists said groslow				148.60896418774186
then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an altar				5744.314172798195
will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn				92.4115335573923

i hope that my frankness at least will make you my friend for you are the only young man to whom i have hitherto spoken as i have done to you tr√©ville said to himself if the cardinal has set this young fox upon me he will certainly not have failed he who knows how bitterly i execrate him to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to me is to rail at him				9.27309817037728
it is my father who has just left his study to accompany the doctor to the door added morrel				43.56086663369611

on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied d artagnan without his sword and the three musketeers armed				6234.276196973386

yes the marechal de grammont is right this will change the aspect of french affairs but i much fear it will do nothing for english even if it does not harm them				49.39604674863483
for what reason is all this fume and fury asked athos				6.721983996026364
has such and such a perfume done anything for me				3.6726573721786964
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident as to the rest m de tr√©ville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously				6711.852343506529
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand				29.680897140354332
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly				1944.385862302076
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu				224.10295354448374

he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence				13954.631004339875
you know something about him do you not madame				172.60014375729165

d artagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends				66.37678083530025
we let them tell their story out replied mousqueton				48.89567607066631

albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the caf√© de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros				32755.175321480026
they found him up less pale than when d artagnan left him after his first visit and seated at a table on which though he was alone was spread enough for four persons				3183.7984074377064
come fanny we will put her to bed m d avrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered				28189.90912244805
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort if i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i can not break				5954.793185962477
grimaud s agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news				16528.840030684896

our gascon knew by the first glance of his eye that his billet had been delivered and that this billet had had its effect				2387.0781258573006

their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly				5730.640439085841

yes my pocket has a hole in it oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling				6830.3364984180025
is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the duc de beaufort has arrived in paris nothing more certain and the best proof of it is said d artagnan that he has dispatched us to meet the duc de vendome his father who is coming in his turn long live de beaufort cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass				1620.038807685268

the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation				3556.420559361547
then they allow the lackey to remain with him yes stuart begged this favor and harrison consented				21208.720912452933

but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed				29505.548308724905
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there				284.89497119075
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for d artagnan and an ace for himself				30.572536912170797
there remained in the banker s house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and eug√©nie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise d armilly				104.48605041140956

since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all				234.9377405460832
ren√©e was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation				4274.621094720858

a single portrait signed by l√©opold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame				8260.113846522318

bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him				8.17131074314592
at first athos supported the association for a time with his own means				1914.2610348921744
then d artagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting				15915.0154507778
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow				2424.516526610863
by the way what said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated				136.5164033465954
they were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with eyes of fascination smiles of love and bright and flowing hair				10352.503702841253
monte cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said come gentlemen some coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn				14703.662599974463
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken				428.0452426385995

d artagnan took out the parcel which he had desired bernouin to place under the seat				14749.742494646245
the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber				198.771937903359
before questioning me he said reply to my question				251.54748016237244
but with the rapidity of thought d artagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed				4183.012998338076
take care that the french do not take their revenge on you for the sicilian vespers i will do my best the streets are full of armed men continued d artagnan				1.0144026282261212
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head				380.51131823391887
every evening he shuts himself in there				656.7032277245679
danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage				224.02025868919148
the old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so and then when d artagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good				696.8470941108736
the moment is at hand he said				18.391798137840404

but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him				48.88171221511721
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give				2620.7600104378353

this fawn colored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of la lionne mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queen like grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on raoul				172.75395268709374
the queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke thus				6486.659833219611
she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care and what is her name hayd√©e replied monte cristo				1.0047665832127421

yes replied the brigadier and as his head is valued at a thousand roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch him the two young persons exchanged looks				1723.8350145660052
aramis he continued was intimate with a young needlewoman from tours a cousin of his named marie michon ah i knew her cried the duchess				2726.3393832987704
the m√™l√©e became general but strength was on the side of the musketeers				124.70852729027644
they will return said d artagnan				1.006905913334725
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action				2214.9641241935137
whom does your highness wish me to send to you any one except grimaud the officer of the guard then with his chessboard yes five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess				18088.53929773573
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly				36382.02456480806
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it				8.149450148430898
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues				5002.783749442167
and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not yes and it was they who told you something which made you angry				4043.0484660011434
i don t think so answered the other he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme				28135.843558614477
edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows				4773.730575202395
only a few days replied monte cristo				1.0072065590720212
sit down dear count and go on with your story at this point i have to accuse myself of a fault madame				614.2192702806403
you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow creature or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked				16206.963858977688
god pardon me cried buckingham i really think he threatens me no my lord i still plead				5092.651677731914
his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht				3380.5975478147925
40302m it is just as i tell you i assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this disclosure				59689.478772868424
your holiness said gondy my friend you take me for some one else no your holiness i take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor i recognized you at the first glance gondy smiled				442.17608420015443
at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes				18318.909052410447
enter gentlemen said laporte since the queen desires you so to do then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe				92369.91013465667
but said d artagnan in the ear of athos you are going to get us all killed without mercy we are much more likely to be killed said athos if we do not go my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that s a fair bet i hope i take it said m de busigny so let us fix the stake you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for eight				768.8603717832266
as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure i saw she would ere long become a mother				444.6772286150399
meanwhile grimaud still mute as ever drew from the pie the other poniard the rope ladder and the gag				4481.396735869071
madame he replied monsieur d artagnan s prediction has been accomplished they are calm as if by enchantment				1068.6267338160283
dant√®s was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones				2602.3175092289653
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door				15.32754369042866
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat				571.2064275966535
my dear count said albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory believe me as long as i live i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions				31166.715078223107
the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted				1381.82932996254
the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice				1376.1356118858107
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m de rothschild and you have seen her her 20183m the beautiful greek of yesterday no we heard i think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains where was this window with white hangings asked the countess				8459.327999690815
a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat				2731.5314003432454
we say aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior				45191.66671039581
go on baptistin then to admit no one except major bartolomeo cavalcanti and his son you hear major bartolomeo cavalcanti a man who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of italy whose name dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of the inferno you remember it do you not				32.33968884619271
he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage				503.43260591576586
if he were minister and i were his d artagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a mazarin mordieu				5657.446929043219
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted				937.5721049555684
he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eug√©nie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck				3737.226412243928
an englishman you say yes replied maximilian an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french at rome				23.967732818672193
tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you 30157m i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i can not say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service				441.67982059192457
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls				19155.622650391062
then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel				457.300380047073
parry said the king rising too my horse i desire to go to thirsk egad said d artagnan to athos your king has thoroughly taken me and i am quite at his service if what you say is sincere replied athos he will never reach london how so because before then we shall have carried him off well this time athos said d artagnan upon my word you are mad have you some plan in your head then asked aramis				14.64750340779291
50249m danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him				8.470051578574425
no madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a christian what you are ignorant of lord de winter s designs upon me i am impossible you are his confidant i never lie madame oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine them i seek to divine nothing madame i wait till i am confided in and apart from that which lord de winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to me why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world can not equal in horror you are deceived madame said felton blushing lord de winter is not capable of such a crime good said milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime then aloud the friend of that wretch is capable of everything whom do you call that wretch asked felton				53.79574875686264
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation				3970.8124413667324
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds				1794.88595141013
now said he i may require to go in one night from paris to tr√©port let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours your highness had already expressed that wish said bertuccio and the horses are ready				559.8111672090813
and what will that signify to me				4.081708772419974
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears				7027.242549285804
but my wife wants a gold chain and i want a pair of silver buckles the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box which contained several samples of the articles demanded				4647.945107698284
i should like however to know what this letter addressed to tr√©ville contains and the stranger muttering to himself directed his steps toward the kitchen				1515.0721576817484
who are these gentleman three of the king s musketeers				333.6103571901915
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle				5591.0770993498845
have you never seen anyone enter your room at night oh yes i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium then you do not know who it is that attempts your life 50073m no said valentine who could desire my death you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening				20170442.562650453
what you tell me is horrible sir				97.4371369028656
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed				146.95600929889196
at this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure it was arthur				40138.06801846137
again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him				4.1309118042578366
tomorrow is the twenty third and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet he sets sail tomorrow				1571.1511205939044
he has been sent by cromwell to mazarin and the queen guessed rightly we have been forestalled				1606.7924458495527
monte cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed a grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean an atom in the infinite precisely cried albert				157.40238143514662
i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away i suppose to the spaniards there s no use in thinking any more about athos				258.25290132567227
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous				3339.390253381428
it appears according to your account that if by mischance a musketeer is arrested france is in danger				2291.242000939441
never had he been so well received				247.1864235576754
what attempt to murder me in my father s house in my room on my bed of sickness				45017.069540889155
such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of cardinal mazarin once that of cardinal richelieu				394.2762220772442
yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads				4427.151381485296
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart				99.87877256193886
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came				1284.544238211536
dead no dying saddled yes saddled and bridled then we are upon the fugitives courage we have them but if they are numerous observed mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have us nonsense cried d artagnan they ll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as we re in pursuit they ll be afraid and will disperse certainly remarked porthos				10.132129347164303
you must hope for us both maximilian that will make me at least partly happy but why must you leave me so soon i do not know particulars				50936.49996652329
this itinerary possessed another great advantage that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrini s story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up				371.3929426876554
adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme				80.78442533009402
i confess it but pardon to every sin				73736.26693238817
the bird on the branch the dog in his kennel the sheep in the field the boats moored in the loire even became alive and vocal				42167.31656871264
she had allowed herself to be exceeded in generosity				4936.744024140457
repudiated by her husband said athos				7.879923376942327
planchet said d artagnan cocking his pistols i will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one below				2201.3434677346013
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere have i not obeyed				12479.407621370798
the petition finished villefort read it aloud				789.4019359769756
i think i learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between us what i have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest hush said milady let us not even here speak thus of him				26.87462460073088
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution				23871.271473331642
you are not willing that i should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul but i repeat it again to you replied felton in great emotion no danger threatens you i will answer for lord de winter as for myself dunce cried milady dunce				3263.1005807001034
oh tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto d artagnan s				39.24231768303118
the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for				455.90019820127196
he returned to merc√©d√®s with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter				282.9659618836195
on the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike				1352.4163120581095
0081m you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken				1112.2222651362965
the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished				10313.40199921191
ah it is m de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely				8493.708514527421
what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation				7562.534080843184
on the contrary we shall meet again said merc√©d√®s pointing to heaven with solemnity				3967.1825010385423
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors				8181.627868365938
the queen has not only one son but two then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal no my lord but he will be answered the guard				6357.321156036313
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand				12.624423687148225
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it				12.311570751710514
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary				107.69787703518585
the devil take the madman murmured m de tr√©ville unless added he this is a cunning mode of escaping seeing that he had failed in his purpose chapter iv				9691.483235410575
presently the door opened and she perceived felton				441.83780585307187
madame bonacieux presented her cheek to him				10.864107109127762
and very princely added ch√¢teau renaud				1.5824498003628629
ah wretch cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my secret				119.72423530496413
you understand my dear girl continued d artagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in oh my god				139.1684622278867
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers				4135.363820899095
if i were not in such haste and if i were not running after someone said d artagnan				1.0047372578016138
on arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital				3672.551774801264
bernouin shut the door and went away				470.90142380279354
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart alas my dear aramis said d artagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are relating how yes a woman whom i love whom i adore has just been torn from me by force				921.1189490627147
villefort placed the arm of madame de saint m√©ran within his own and conducted her to his apartment				177.88971646217655
still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure				660.0038538257189
however he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night				98.61968863925414
has he not seen monsieur d artagnan at my house oh yes yes you are right				66.81914563142492
how can it be effected someone must be sent to the duke but who who				136936.2143648488
my dear aramis said d artagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them you are mistaken friend d artagnan said aramis always on his guard this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in one syllable verse which i began yonder ah indeed said d artagnan				1.0042560102165101
i did not seek one i did not ask for one				453.24428302706787
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan				64539.714945727705
you have never seen our africans count said albert				109.57487072940447
i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall think for how do i know to the contrary that this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it i will come count i will be sure to come said villefort eagerly				33.66388528921925
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court and what are they oh he doesn t stand well with his eminence mouston said porthos saddle vulcan and bayard and for myself monsieur shall i saddle rustaud no take a more stylish horse phoebus or superbe we are going with some ceremony ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit oh				735.6617788338232
to the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it please god to france where at least i understand the architecture of the houses so suiting the action to the word d artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others				1726.0475825901542
wait for me here all of you cried m morrel i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on that s right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind				6356.866461254585
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abb√© like all other abb√©s and what was the end of the affair we met in the place royale egad				3295.7231690258086
of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death it is i who no longer understand you madame said felton				85.16272734686319
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise				32944.33306278925
d artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal this was his second interview with richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last				2983.662776182912
oh grace grace pardon cried the wretch falling on her knees				141.30950136205928
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				1825.0909656163483
i have my sword and no one waiting for you outside no then you had better come with me thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it				5.419294955315648
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses				218.57252085651209
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort				66.84703056834844
finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself				31.65295788131632
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts				40402.406557583025
they were influenced by hatred by avarice and by self love but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment				10616.548671411518
pardieu beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed				847.5094087119265
you know it is you alone whom i love how can i know that by the scorn i will throw upon her d artagnan took a pen and wrote madame until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor besides i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them				182.38372772622037
and on what floor does he live asked comminges				593.5023445364482
ah may you be a true prophet said d artagnan laughing				28.771306150685724
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment				282.95058043158167
noirtier looked the permission which she solicited				48276.28017383219
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m de morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him but i have since learned that you had that right				123.86324627574503
you may see matters differently d artagnan and think otherwise				1218.312794445267
the four friends saw all this not a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them				18.35362300436884
the next day just as debray was signing the deed that is about five o clock in the afternoon madame de morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the coup√© of the diligence which closed upon her				6.2857382691344155
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman				414.83334196324984
i might as well say count benedetto				5322.379061777061
come in come in monsieur porthos the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity				12943.629214489758
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot				2698.549755157648
come finish your cup of coffee said monte cristo the history is ended chapter 78				5765.883913822621
it is in london they must be found what are your eminence s orders not a word of what has passed				1424.59852629962
after the king and the cardinal m de tr√©ville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens				61817.53663753578
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman				57437452.023771755
monsieur your friend pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears but we do not know that name monsieur your friend having disabled two men with his pistols retreated fighting with his sword with which he disabled one of my men and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it you villain will you finish cried d artagnan athos what has become of athos while fighting and retreating as i have told monseigneur he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him and as the door was open he took out the key and barricaded himself inside				2498.849013529357
the guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron				2854.595820482246
then i should like to have three sons i should make the first a nobleman like athos the second a good soldier like porthos the third an excellent abb√© like aramis				40.01362221966246
but after all asked porthos who is milady a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine				86.54543338717882
read me her letter oh my lord said laporte				155274.30946627603
but now we are alone although it is immaterial to me where are we going into normandy if you like delightful shall we be quite retired				1213.8819331261727
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen				40.800349327033025
20245m why should he doubt it said beauchamp to ch√¢teau renaud				1805.8805941047137
we shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting to morrow oh as to that sir replied chatillon for it was he who with flamarens was leaving the duc de beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it i hope that is true said aramis				24.900813998068777
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from you your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well well i must tell you				4.870994892783241
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure				6879.044540710985
can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter which i have just received said the astonished athos				88.20863466106876
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse				94.25575870158589
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone				2187.5499509646406
come cheer up is there anything that i can do for you i wish to see the governor i have already told you it was impossible why so because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it what is allowed then better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but i wish to see the governor if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hunger that is all the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone				20.10847382864126
athos never received any letters athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know				166.34575907454473
oh said the count i only know two things which destroy the appetite grief and as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not that and love				861.5932921357444
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment				10284.133441519969
well then said d artagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it the fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellais only fired to appease their consciences				390009.4165130986
bring hither that horse friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road				809.0998834180417
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks				266.8432317094268
it was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brother in law she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving england she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be murdered buckingham cried the monk				142.93022403748904
speak madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart				1655.3629832496188
impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing up				842.4672598171112
the porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the count s approach				22225.446469654606
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me but i can not leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped				152.2030714780325
really porthos you are a gifted individual i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera				10921.968867707967
see what good fortune i brought you said morrel when he was alone with the count				86.00429196156861
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls				110.06517527929034
you are young replied athos and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances epilogue la rochelle deprived of the assistance of the english fleet and of the diversion promised by buckingham surrendered after a siege of a year				257.2036302695096
but felton that s another thing				271.1570914308954
his first cry was for his father but that father was dead my father too is dead said morrel				23.61611057358588
my dear athos he said i am going away				814.9159227739422
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her				7.979906608689042
are all these crimes committed on his account ah then you at length understand heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him valentine you are an angel but why is my grandfather allowed to live it was considered that you dead the fortune would naturally revert to your brother unless he were disinherited and besides the crime appearing useless it would be folly to commit it and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman do you recollect in the arbor of the h√¥tel des postes at perugia seeing a man in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana				28244.644232507355
d artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not so				253.59245095435006
for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy				60679.02392853629
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point				545.1378737708621
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings				96518.81921955648
i will expose all to whom to m danglars by heaven cried caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir to caderousse s great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the count s breast flew back blunted				20488.12769629036
you here at this hour said she				63.898335958229644
no the sacrifice returned ch√¢teau renaud ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us the history to which m morrel alludes continued ch√¢teau renaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories				2985.4730265863996
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited d artagnan to drink				4117.933610795303
hang it cried d artagnan another twenty pistoles lost				1499.932223019857
you are there sir he said respectfully				5276.4594317248375
as to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail				5422.738618280581
porthos opened his mouth to reply d artagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed				1795.5279674419767
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast				2656.281935387236
in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves				315737.4588447401
the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney				58735.72887222152
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars				717.3900515048373
you must love somebody no i am alone in the world then you will love me				5.418076033238876
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m morrel left on old dant√®s chimney piece and which you tell me is still in your hands caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abb√© a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt				2762.6546724604327
at what time you please sir replied franz				49.69817386355473
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends aramis shook his head				6.69799283228285
dant√®s ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothing the cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage				1456.1937018115107
i did not lose sight of him for an instant				318.5734539662132
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dant√®s listening ears mingled with brutal laughter				1446.9947392999104
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d artagnan				1.0118876694316354
30193m excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap i am not up there i know but i have only just come down do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i had twenty one five more than last year				994.9061876493406
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal				140355.86093374126
god preserved me but a man named brisemont died in my place we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as before				416.2615947571767
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully				37350.69094001303
i was mistaken said the host he s not quite dumb				37548.1204398089
thank you parry when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall				15954.587405117223
i am not precisely rich though i am pretty well off hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of you				5.078729614170716
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at porthos				149.12410250603173
the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed				476.69768931810887
all the rest of the square was paved with heads				8276.799378381365
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain				4296.466131239979
i say there for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there				260.601415389293
i confess i am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in italy justice is only paid when silent in france she is paid only when she speaks				61974.7892251947
all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious				1684.583456408674
she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed				640.3376412246497
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries				71373.9181743745
bravo bravo morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained				60580.034698259304
andrea read in a low voice you are poor a miserable old age awaits you				21.020223953213414
carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him				11.953820903741544
on entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him				4.469927859274288
good it is by my side				613.0357020833483
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastile where he remained for twelve long years when his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court				840.7288062463999
i confess i began to be very uneasy on your account but your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear porthos said d artagnan directing the sick man s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles				336.25767955153293
i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero				1855.772424415728
then at least turn the gem inside you silly fellow for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony does not find such stones in his mother s jewel case you think then i have something to dread asked d artagnan				1.0073521135685854
i have chosen the drawing room sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker s study				355.6530676523924
ah cried the cardinal i thought you were a gascon my friend i am a gascon said i only when i succeed the answer pleased him and he laughed				2194.570859952701
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eug√©nie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone hayd√©e may hear you perhaps and you think she would be angry no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression				878.1665979968401
go and promote digestion by working said the procurator gravely				80.2956529700811
i am going to beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and i shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses beauchamp will never retract then we must fight no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name we will fight nevertheless				59722.33314572192
maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room				25.22371525780224
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance asked richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance				785.709299391041
on entering the banker s mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of m andrea cavalcanti				205.5076628694595
did she stay long there an hour and a half did she return home directly well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening				54.440972566125815
bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead				629.7527499474107
baron have you any report more recent than this dated the 20th february and this is the 3rd of march no sire but i am hourly expecting one it may have arrived since i left my office go thither and if there be none well well continued louis xviii make one that is the usual way is it not and the king laughed facetiously				14347.651002563203
debray stretched himself upon a large couch and madame danglars passed into her dressing room with mademoiselle corn√©lie				15870.727825583652
well said danglars did you see him i have just left him answered caderousse				34.5511272396559
he must be mad said the inspector				35.01284814816405
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moment s silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation why in truth sir was monte cristo s reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had nothing else to do				120.11690776214984
that is i murmured milady in extreme terror what do you want we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos you shall be free to defend yourself				420.03680186744526
you have an order signed by the cardinal said the governor				97.25044723435487

however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him				71.4289991558263
mazarin especially yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreigner well he would be more justly estimated				9225.3216584525
king of france who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy				1406.827683688099
i saw her and you know who she is i believe i can guess at least listen said aramis				28.156757801045334

i increased in wickedness till i committed crime				23906.652362343815
the perspiration poured forth upon the young man s brow and he felt as if he should faint				4506.794934029686
unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn you love valentine that daughter of an accursed race never had morrel witnessed such an expression never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face never had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous nights of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire				2738.1273744720147
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit				8820.224723785288
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner				883.758205644899
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish				6666.654684168641

and where am i inquired monte cristo laughingly				598.5815190094323
d artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy				7139.975217224075
d artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge				2787.3166149462645
these men are going to behead your father				114.83550459359884
his looking glass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper				71019.3534467803
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped				80.9584192593083
i am cold i am hungry				3502.993397657779

but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait athos stopped				81.66130455660627

i am a priest and confessions die in my breast				541.3293130143841
at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio				1880.1562869324434
d artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m de tr√©ville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as specimens				80084.3981335444
porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall aramis seized his knife d artagnan arose				368.4797218271719

my young vicomte replied scarron i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive raoul blushed again				73.97753619886112

the audience m de tr√©ville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving d artagnan s response the b√©arnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent				1175.3694995533501

no by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation				77333.3328580909
milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips she had to deal with a gascon who played close				40325.68772963029
desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with mme				189.08687650352925
their connection could not last long without ruining both				756.1462904010946

everything goes as if in flowery paths everything goes too well porthos				1866.8097493821203
supposing also i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per cent i never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half but to my son in law i would give five and we would share the profits very good father in law said cavalcanti yielding to his low born nature which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it				7.263770668150342
if her majesty will have faith in my counsels she ought to profit by this event to address at this moment in favor of her august husband the court of france				36.50434092107119
what have i done wrong father she said that you should take this key from me nothing my dear replied the unhappy man the tears starting to his eyes at this simple question nothing only i want it julie made a pretence to feel for the key				728.2145542835428
d artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon d artagnan s sword				1126.6589732822015
it is i shouted a voice				228.32496980890198
true i forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants the street of saint honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day				359.13537879596345
call charles he added addressing the boy who waited				48157.50559636343
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark				1780.5172570963969
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach				2719.07416929442
i see you are covered with blood i believe said raoul that i have got something like a scratch on the arm				944.7827524340612
these words of felton s passed like ice through her veins				894.6814928865041

was there not some snare laid for her				9.77380183999013

port he said extending his hand in the direction of the first compartment examined by d artagnan and himself				7.2864000064924515
charles having proceeded with aramis as with athos embraced them both				474.766771965442
at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat				403.63044746605783
there are ten men to accompany you				17.28712897111994
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation				1062.4504286519023
soldiers are big children but as i maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed d artagnan could not restrain a smile				298.6451093834896
you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name				131.92173421936744
then you must know what her name was as a young girl oh mon dieu cried the executioner i think i am dying				1821.6548924642418

there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and i will say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land				506.1762060248064
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving d artagnan s composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge you accept however i always accept do you think the thing possible everything is possible shall you be attacked on the road probably and what will you do in that case i shall pass through those who attack me and suppose you can not pass through them so much the worse for them i shall pass over them and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain yes on your life on my life you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration				478.8944311362792
he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh air books and writing materials				9755.97860877995
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place				1434.526306142779

very well cried i then the place of my punishment will be that of my tomb				1035.9283348219349
at that time i was not concerned in the adventure in the course of which you have so successfully estopped me				8.850399496076781
he had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals				11923.911594020441
the state which is now threatened would be safe and you and i well you the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility did he tell you so yes i know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise be satisfied replied bonacieux my wife adores me and there is yet time the ninny murmured mme				24.286564262776245

but i hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the pleasure of your company sir said monte cristo				1.004801869538335
after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage				593.4454634641116
come speak avow freely that you accuse him no sire but i say that he deceives himself				162.96833649037586
the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered hand				502.5471011647301
well then we will put simply my lord do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared my dear d artagnan you will never make anything but a very bad secretary				30632.266367400738
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonder for whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that richelieu was great i will not contradict you there said d artagnan				1.0072696208646061
at last his patience was exhausted				1504.3057410218148
what a beautiful creature cried valentine why did you not bring him close to the gate so that i could talk to him and pat him he is as you see a very valuable animal said maximilian				82.41181882298336

but know you who he was he used to be the headsman of bethune you knew him				42.63287647250294
planchet was equally seized with admiration and said no more about going away				191.80189660314446
our gascon promised this without risk for he knew all that was meant				1138.6011136231864
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe				8797.416710931271

the popular banker found that it answered better than count				643.8006360011797
and now you are assembled gentlemen said d artagnan permit me to offer you my apologies at this word apologies a cloud passed over the brow of athos a haughty smile curled the lip of porthos and a negative sign was the reply of aramis				87.72893241934098
but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed when a company of the guards of his eminence commanded by m de jussac turned the corner of the convent				963.4077347083391
but said the count so great was ali pasha s confidence that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care albert started on hearing these words the history of hayd√©e recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave				2373.415153230238
their toilet finished they descended the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets				4188.833344217087

i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another				1269.5534187336282
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent				204.04047213883666

morrel held out his hand to her				9.713740703549119

the cardinal however did not unseal the letter at once but continued to turn it again and again in his hand then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger you are very young monsieur mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest diplomatists often fail my lord i am twenty three years of age but your eminence is mistaken in saying that i am young				1778.7445440818274

i am hardly nineteen i know nothing i have no part to play				25175.74914419035
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the f√™te given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his grace s lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written				1611.3953299758846
he hastened to open the secr√©taire and found the pocket book in the drawer and in it the letter of credit				3551.417980648709
one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not blaspheme unhappy child the crime is that of your father not yours of your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive after that i ceased to blaspheme but i cursed my father				61.11403042479748

she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance				4732.449714439163
but the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his eminence				189.03008193593823

come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me				3.701006599110608
and you did not tell him that you came from me no sir at ten o clock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter				3.136881042548954

am i mistaken then said monte cristo				1.004092097369099
his hat was a little napless his feather was a little faded his gold lace was a little tarnished his laces were a trifle frayed but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos				1406.4929804799394

why your prot√©g√© m andrea cavalcanti ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize m andrea at least not as concerns m danglars and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it what do you think he is paying his addresses i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions				1730.8979967194
but pray sit down thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow				3679.286087136653
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly				1672.998522752259

my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said morcerf				160.87741865781896

the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner				599.9702975103198

you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20 000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself				58.186644547290776

as villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brother in law is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of 1814 and we can not molest napoleon without breaking those compacts oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m de salvieux				699.5151012500563

but to her great surprise d artagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better when will you do that immediately i hope ah				73.13540763597179

the crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee				426.47201979991377
then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons				971.6113133145066
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence				11551.718147896285
still silent valentine had promised not to wake				56444.29612331349

ah my dear father said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you how do you do my dear son said the major gravely				50.78518485273432
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave d artagnan uneasiness				366.4987230253881
you will give me a copy this evening which i shall know by heart tomorrow d artagnan looked at his friends as if to say well what did i tell you now continued he addressing planchet you have eight days to get an interview with lord de winter you have eight days to return in all sixteen days				911.4787174666704
in that case i will forgive him and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him				4.416706309349701

there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so d artagnan declares just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door				2.5685057959389983
by the lord my good host				1099.7982180070135
m andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari				217.22532787594454
i have promised you the truth i will tell it were it to destroy me the idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man did it not cried felton				51.061308032218484

render to him then the last service he can by any possibility ask of you and your work will be all the more meritorious the monk made no reply but silently wended his way to the room where the two valets had deposited the dying man on a bed				147.8898983982017
his devotion to the queen was boundless men of loyalty are scarce i think so forsooth said rochefort and when you find any of them you march them off to the bastile				396.1311102995827
an idiot who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income that s true said kitty your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune d artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses				3711.2528499752875
how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardian s hand and i can set out immediately when you like raoul sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room i have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince and you ought to thank her raoul				3253.2692577795624
well everything was finished as you know				80.9204032649371

the chocolate was inoffensive for m de villefort felt no effects				13764.290052494991
now madame danglars feared eug√©nie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eug√©nie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers				6053.622731491345
blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstasies				5694.352358340521

they had arrested him for the purpose of robbery and as he had only a few louis about him he doubted not he would be ransomed				39672.90456261454
villefort while turning restlessly on the cushions felt something press against him				3.6091737068879803

have you wanted money father i want nothing now that i have you said the old man				1.1279785608470687
d artagnan knew his part well he was aware that opportunity has a forelock only for him who will take it and he was not a man to let it go by him without seizing it				6.347155281171616
their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future				177.77846161884077
a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlord s hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m franz d √©pinay				4.349277780181331
at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos				380.4978917675649
pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance				1000.0673322323298
he was intently watching for a shadow to appear among the trees and awaiting with anxiety the sound of a light step on the gravel walk				2547.099385918894
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me this threat brought no reply				180.54982435723167
there he stopped breathless and panting				5295.858231961683
until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods				1993.1844805073604
he was alone alone with these countless these unheard of treasures				5411.409311797107
as he had seen milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving england he suspected that it was almost without a doubt on account of the diamond studs				282.0144291123898
she had profited by my absence and furnished with the half of the linen and having written down the day and hour at which i had deposited the child at the asylum had set off for paris and had reclaimed it				21.122417778189714
you need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain				31986.21240020739
at last after renewed hesitation dant√®s entered the second grotto				1191.2209969926307
she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son				367.248511202708
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and i can not fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you and as a proof of what i say here is mine in my pocket so saying he pulled out his own handkerchief likewise a very elegant handkerchief and of fine cambric though cambric was dear at the period but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms only ornamented with a single cipher that of its proprietor				9073.621572518525
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him but men are changed by events there is nothing truer than that said porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine				1275.4640467088905
dant√®s approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea				96.67020866115043
of aramis yes since he has become an abb√©				1219.3624182116853
the sentinel opened the door it was a new face				481.80838868265994
the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened				291.42835556738345
do you talk of a sacrifice i do do you then suspect anyone i suspect no one death raps at your door it enters it goes not blindfolded but circumspectly from room to room				2721.1987569733774
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted there was a moment s silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dant√®s was listening in horror				5610.2734257848915
and you shall be alone replied the young man				1.148998505939626
that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation				961.9002831172
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services the two young men bowed				175.67351819416263
now said d artagnan i ve one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges at your service sir you will see the count again to morrow morning will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained you want the cardinal to come here no i know my place and am not so presumptuous				32706.293485019316
all s well he cried as he entered i have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow				20019.20927912485
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers				191.7296581758172
i place no confidence in their hypocritical faces				52585.283283654084
ah yes that is the name certainly				1898.9421338929426
oh if she betrayed your majesty on the side of your honor it would be quite another thing and i should be the first to say no grace sire no grace for the guilty happily there is nothing of the kind and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are but the queen not the less deserves all my anger it is you sire who have now incurred hers				31789.880824245727
monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl s arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child				1005.320922753262
a great pity said monte cristo				1.007561445211635
thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark				3416.792222381344
m danglars is my banker m de villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him				6.3352327687953665
there do you hear observed gaetano he is bidding you adieu the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore				240.50224758430693

as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in				354.11619422548756
notwithstanding all the pains he took d artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new made friends				142.60753679065462
that is my name said athos quietly				914.63783241579
a presentiment instantly told d artagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently				1271.8498464015704
it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette				235.96896555541133
tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced				4163.936241836579
is that all then in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of memory				2469.084202046658
that is impossible replied the governor				34.82091128531303
have you really no desire to meet him none whatever replied eug√©nie				234.3065334144918
you have forgotten it porthos said he				4.397528782169729
whilst they pursue him the king might escape it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him what do you think of this counsel winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him				2.8798310476538336
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand				7.160655910828991
madame say that you would love me then				88.3305279080903
it was planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of piedmont				15900.769930912309
d artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him				3.5599836761802615
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all d artagnan blushed				16.53492019063962
the soubrette said for your master i have no other master but you so a pretty little lass my faith is that soubrette d artagnan opened the letter and read these words a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest				562.870070291342
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties how is it all the better yes for his eminence will give you all that you want land money and titles ah				103.70536801893265
i think this is about your position is it not confound it yes replied danglars				60.17687436278294
now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of your eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that i may not commit an error there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors				173211.92402732043
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth and yet said d artagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make sorties and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans				28067.95903582242
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other				119.37359555560263
it is not mercy then that you are about to accord sire it is justice and he is in the fort l ev√™que said the king				13.4013795946081
they reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have been				2073.2906680150345
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error well then if it be so are you ready albert perfectly let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy yes let us do so the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said i signori francesi the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter				275.9909302723708
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambition fernand and danglars how was this jealousy manifested				42707.35963419435
athos wounded anew by cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way a foot				2336.994272961343
you say you desire my mother s good opinion i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent 30111m do you think so said monte cristo with interest				2289.003369151898
what have we all done then dear grandpapa said valentine you no longer seem to love any of us the old man s eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness				27713.509835410532
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus				15202.617103465702
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression				953.4226577029402
i see how it will be said athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just now				469.81319907844977
in that case i should beat a retreat				383.3110563061711
i do not feel remorse because that woman i profoundly hold deserved her punishment				4748.5621821426275
friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that shall i take out any more of them asked porthos				8.515245122929704
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point				3864.3624857839654
did you ever hear of such an idea monte cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his face				43.56010848273908
milady de boulogne evening of the twenty fifth				2747.491739741021
it is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good say not so quickly returned monte cristo say not so my friends angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to be				553.1704593222925
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven				193.581649865316
are the carbines loaded yes brigadier well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd				881.116557474317
but you sent for me my dear child				159.7511004015203
why should an exception be made in her favor i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception it is true but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come carlini s teeth clenched convulsively				1715.3254895352288
one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue f√©rou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abb√© busoni were within				1009.8516017138002
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed				1229.5244453823418
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant i shall borrow from the queen but her majesty has no property interposed aramis				444.05744795356435
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress				848.522748727527
i content myself with saying command monseigneur i am ready your pardon said richelieu surprised				352.9688247417149
it was warm work we were in a place where it was not very cold replied porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him				3.7115015824074664
who goes there was asked a second time				136.0456607325613
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over				370.90501544732365
i am well i want nothing do not call him she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room				18.542606256282447
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you				2.7851142412793637
mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle				5092.899377042069
mistrust porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as god on earth will assist him in contriving mazarin s escape if mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and resolute				6289.521070516753
but could i do with a million retorted the count				12.29567166150146
but to resume my story i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading				3654.7049266865233
yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung next if one of them comes to my side asked porthos must i kill him yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extremity i can do it said porthos				10.025230554988335
the devil take this gout cried monsieur de bouillon evidently ill at ease				3771.3830399313483
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key				521.4029359203256
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length				23.233740733848112
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen				127120.23876893171
d artagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money				144.68125495553664
now since the affair of nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one				571.7585208176955
at this moment a patrol passed by				22781.92819221932
i do not madame rejoined mazarin				51.697986488197216
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her				8.62000886395463
bonacieux the one he had just picked up				360.33646894058097
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the english				548.1160767667914
he sent us home in his own carriage				360.1621119923551
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night				212.48845817617237
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber				75.07854641691297
two hours after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded				16875.622635647327
besides whether at home or not whether in paris or cairo the abb√© always left something to give away which the valet distributed through this wicket in his master s name				232.9216638537168
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands				45.04743885218187
it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand tr√©ville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel				214.86468730572264
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom				1074.5432582970993
eight days after i was back again madame				379.8967269425304
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated				4507.108700015661
when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are				89.7350944174781
you are too charming said d artagnan sorrowfully and you abuse my love no i use your generosity that s all				199.90342928511882
you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairs on the expulsion of don carlos				60926.507989624646
let him pass d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard				922.4749514310208
well is all said all then let s count our money and divide it				8.812950825834056
are they both dead asked lord de winter sternly				1160.8088990622764
the two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another				139.96039923073226
it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices				9255.662793620706
it was a mistake yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the minister s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700 000 francs but sir said hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by m debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it				6.280802948767338
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy				11870.607653995854
the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands				921.1576015629702
mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him				11.027751327287366
de salvieux my brother s chamberlain yes sire he is at marseilles and writes me thence does he speak to you of this conspiracy no but strongly recommends m de villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty m				680.1465907770303
anne de bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven				115.59993821351036
they separated and d artagnan rushed between them like a dart				11832.066790661363
you are the directors of all consciences				7903.179363982266
but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting master				1579.1050366223665
each person s attention was occupied				5924.205773788999
as to porthos that is certainly droll but i am not the less a giddy fool				19089.259798508905
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us				97.23588731954281
i do not remember if it is exactly 48 000 francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference				890.756714483055
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project				14982.045717137751
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty				645.4014166884698
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any ill feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties your father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them				14.166170077885411
i shall meet with a victim				6047.661968473661
you think then as i do that she deceives me said the king				30.27273056383134
two royal pages were playing with him				21.5087585384104
i like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly				8510.281535775885
i have not yet had time to see him again				90.41979329417768
la ramee i recommend monsieur le duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an instant la ramee became therefore the duke s dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper the shadow of his person but la ramee gay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the duke s eyes his incorruptibility				28051.18070999186
it happened that on this particular night the minister s box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by merc√©d√®s sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question				1401.968568736954
go from hence to blangy and from blangy to neufch√¢tel				3675.372304068085

the procurator s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse				139.19719937499045
but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips				34.56376607617855

the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman				11354.678920029492
paris is not paved with cambric monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said d artagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions				7500.605494987263
beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage				270.3265932571333

as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her albert shook his head and looked thoughtful				4814.558758495171
the procureur went out after having double locked the door				12.785350558052404
they obtained information at ablain and a statement of their route was left for grimaud				551.8676422445565
this man except a sword had all the appearance of a soldier and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day				129.91909208443045
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile you are sagacious i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me you				61.01197498262789

gentlemen said d artagnan you shall have your turn				575.1102754065944
d artagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal				48.87097977548461

ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all				1841.3271767777646
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head				37.77081529158041
monsieur d artagnan monsieur du vallon you are free the order was obeyed d artagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle				6088.512097214665
no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain to every argument they replied we must go for death is in this house they all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially mademoiselle valentine so good so kind and so gentle				3567.7463729134975
on whom does my bleeding heart repose				4376.545892834498
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself				63.858129399834
you had your secret and we had ours we didn t exchange them				70.5708765602694
a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror				195.59911967029788

as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the caf√© de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted				13035.596303463728
yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture give me another cutlet no try this hare which i had killed yesterday in one of my warrens zounds				7579.415004254651
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all i tell you madame i do not ask you to tell me said mazarin astounded by this returning courage				6265.185772264475

they entered behind a glass window by the light of the cardinal s lantern which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the castle of rueil in long lines forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys				4718.38940964844
but you say you do not wish to kill me no and yet you will let me perish with hunger ah that is a different thing well then wretches cried danglars i will defy your infamous calculations i would rather die at once				60.780429661979085

but i do not see the count of monte cristo here he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of 100 000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality by the way m de ch√¢teau renaud asked beauchamp how is morrel ma foi i have called three times without once seeing him				191.42043814920993
now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea saying which monte cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count				40.67140069553125
but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid all were it my life oh but i said anne i also duke have had presentiments i also have had dreams				4413.33728609082

they heard the horsemen pass under the windows				314.0648385493666
excuse me said d artagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him				2.341625477960781
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raoul s departure				698.3279875155321
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s mousetrap which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned d artagnan				1.0093827248892313
pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer				324.4366154175949

my mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it you have despoiled me of my fortune				361.87031301594783
then he added in a low tone yes that is the haven and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears				1108.1185896021452
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe i ought rather to say what i know what you know and even what i am sure of and of what are you so sure i would say that i know this great lady you yes i and how do you know her oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion speak				2266.785636406309

in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money				972.0812134895492
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory				693.0171356466002

villefort being called on to prove the crime was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases				29484.70490976488
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time				76.83736283886512
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent				328.960452425653
and not without a deal of trouble too has the executioner left london asked athos				3.5814194638973866
a movement of fury called to his side some twenty of his musketeers and pointing to the bench where his enemies were fire on that bench he cried				169.46971142992263
i try to be beloved not feared well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says like master like servant pray what does that mean it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them he				4733.677468354606
as the doctors entered the street they saw a man in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door				40.81584827527541
these notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army				685.9914694286274
the count s well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice				10158.456811698597
to this preoccupation of his vanity d artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish				18332.995505666713
as to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin				29735.715405785613
forward cried d artagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear				778.9553593563197
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out				24.159221666782354
he felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart				46.87323913605749
your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself				5184.035077574277
she has near her a certain laporte who i believe is the mainspring of all this i confess said the cardinal				12.014196487419364
as long as it was dark they remained silent in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity and apprehended ambushes on every side				233.67289942538616
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered edmond				232.47438799878898
what would be the use of carrying so much more weight was the reply i can do that when we get there yes you re right replied the companion				5957.650374662244
suddenly planchet entered bringing two letters for d artagnan				1.023539781499508
i shall get them all in time oh as for that said danglars angry at this prolongation of the jest as for that you won t get them at all				103.0044121668007

mine host s face does not please me at all it is too gracious nor me either said athos				10.035298354033936
at the same time the count appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black hair was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel				1684.6806551232598
god gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you in the name of that god i act remember that wretch and to spare thee at this moment is still serving him oh said caderousse groaning with pain				1172.723748555266
when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m d √©pinay into personal contact				27654.21234220739
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time				16.80386268680004
scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants his eye rested longer on the president and still more so on the king s attorney				1044.7738493909385
stay said monte cristo as though he had not observed her confusion i have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the neapolitan bonds i have none nor have i ever possessed any but really we have talked long enough of money count we are like two stockbrokers have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts what has happened said the count simulating total ignorance				3439.5960687372126
bonaparte m dandr√© looked at louis xviii who employed in writing a note did not even raise his head				133.9515414581953
come come fernand said caderousse hold up your head and answer us				215.3650467686064
i dressed myself as quickly as possible my slow and stiff motions all attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely dissipated				15496.046800050008
then wait said aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock				1559.4685549747808
have you kept him in the cellar all this time merciful heaven				260.59296554447957
reload the muskets grimaud said athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our conversation				1467.6490618164123
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count				51.442809501448025
during our expedition to b√©thune the husband of my duchess died so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me i shall marry the widow				10286.055933120811
gaspard gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abb√© said can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself				164.69927054652152
instead of going direct to his study m morrel had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this moment quitting				51599.57775071773
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him				4.310726876657929
what diabolical villainy you have performed here said porthos when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone				582.4635771390778
two men lay prone upon the ground one bathed in blood and motionless with his face toward the earth this one was dead				455.766088204797

i returned last night and here i am what circumlocution				4202.770306651139
my brother in law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in vain				710.724007748187
he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried				3182.632679102369
answer or we charge beware of what you are about gentlemen said a clear voice which seemed accustomed to command				3671.7077889828392

they breakfasted in haste and at six o clock had already gone ten miles				20280.37488881991
but what is the matter albert				1449.7434705828612

morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio				13071.074879679389
that s a daring rascal whispered the count				16.745363822766453
come i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold monte cristo perceived that the young man had turned around indeed morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a word				68.2236767997722
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me				7.195317838923443
ah what is that cried the brigadier				5833.483143241706
the man who had followed danglars sat down on a bench				4650.015605011337

as for myself that i may put you at your ease i tell you that i am generally called sinbad the sailor and i replied franz will tell you as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin that i see no reason why at this moment i should not be called aladdin				28026.60667658395
those casks which i took for casks of port wine are filled with powder				1087.7733049277617

a prisoner has escaped from the ch√¢teau d if and they are firing the alarm gun replied dant√®s				165.67148296588616
then he thought he was going to die				168.81432435366966
hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly d artagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos				3334.7724628941396
i can not calmly say with you providence has struck the blow but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me				3.1283905321257137
be it so then my father he said extending his hand to morrel die in peace my father i will live morrel was about to cast himself on his knees before his son but maximilian caught him in his arms and those two noble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment				735.1939726122739
they halted for the king to dine				4517.88023043724
madame danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the evening and had gone to bed and to sleep				695.9767254499727
dant√®s carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth				365.7066930063777
ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it				7.024784456458322
because he plainly perceives that his piquette stands in need of being enlivened by a mixture of good wine a watered liquor made from the second pressing of the grape				18045.791212631335
news from your father do you hear henrietta				4887.374444366827

my father said hayd√©e raising her head was that illustrious man known in europe under the name of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and before whom turkey trembled albert without knowing why started on hearing these words pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which gleamed from the brilliant eyes of hayd√©e at this moment she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man to the news of which all europe had listened with horror				15496.770947879719
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth				110491.49035594915

anne questioned d artagnan by a look				306.6203251132709
as for porthos he assaulted the foe with such violence that although his sword was thrust aside the enemy was thrown off his horse and fell about ten steps from it				9.109368405434482
posterity will find a difficulty in understanding this character which history explains only by facts and never by reason				1589.7395755845778
orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal				3.3905582783514854
i never caution my servants a second time remember that baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door				7.7684082037283675
i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty oh a letter				154.73584490368216
allow me then to avoid dishonor by death let me take refuge in martyrdom				8327.54290981539
rochefort said the cardinal you see monsieur d artagnan				1.1746977626114306
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound and grimaud threw the dagger on the table				41.40307091848661
no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity				28857.83560607265
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine				27084.02558714318
the bare idea would kill me would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my finger nails				1434.176122742555
the only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once				29.43454569708657
mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at boulogne sur mer and promise me to set out to morrow morning i promise my lord replied mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave mordaunt bowed				69.49261404872325
the lowest or the least known of them as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company was as sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother				415.7452484134847
these important advantages d artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe				11395.652539975847
there only they explained to them the matter in hand				637.4979124904537
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled				11342.319315469163
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the vari√©t√©s i purchased mine at constantinople it cost me more but i have nothing to fear but you forget replied debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free who will tell her the first person who sees her she only speaks romaic that is different but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes oh no replied monte cristo i do not carry brutalism so far				1385.8591431475204
our position is truly a strange one continued athos laughing				118.01773653518616
come come sleepy head quick the ladder but said bazin yawning portentously the ladder is still at the window the other one the gardener s				62.91518370878203
he converted his chamber into an observatory				115649.73550362328
a man the discussion is going to begin again said mme				36.477161893960364
then rising in despair he exclaimed the chief the chief here i am said vampa instantly appearing what do you want take my last gold muttered danglars holding out his pocket book and let me live here i ask no more for liberty i only ask to live then you suffer a great deal oh yes yes cruelly still there have been men who suffered more than you i do not think so yes those who have died of hunger danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed				227.34861420078553
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection				5986.394824154155
he had then in order not to disturb his habits accustomed grimaud to obey him upon a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips				149.19757507423603
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him				1.9440782322035055
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own				198.44360072065632
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host				348.0245375067845
d artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive				9312.549653379074
i will have my eye upon you for i shall be there replied the cardinal pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear and on our return well we will settle our account ah monseigneur cried d artagnan spare me the weight of your displeasure				8546.768069810072
juxon turned to those present and begged them to leave him and his assistant alone with the king				68.202144289775
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first				2680.427549257066
monsieur pailletin if you please my good woman replied andrea				902.6303485926899
grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence				1067.9858983852369
perhaps i shall stand in need of a back door for retreat you think of everything and you forget one thing what to ask me if i want money that s true				123.50737476580285
much money to be gained said bonacieux protruding his lip				32859.581802139124
for all this continued milady i should long ago have revenged myself on him if and i don t know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him oh yes but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of what the mercer s wife of the rue des fossoyeurs				8969.732539553079
well grandpapa said valentine kneeling before him and pointing to maximilian i love him and will be only his were i compelled to marry another i would destroy myself the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts				793.2011837665707
the only thing that astonished d artagnan was that his friends had never thought of this				785.4609421280836
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house so that since that time replied d artagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host				286.22012122875395
seven o clock had just struck and m bertuccio according to the command which had been given him had two hours before left for auteuil when a cab stopped at the door and after depositing its occupant at the gate immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment				4164.972812028837
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dant√®s				636.9880335443042
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance				3936.3509356306486
the life of the four young men had become fraternal				10237.046846820092
m de tr√©ville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king				28.09493775026825
you surprise me exclaimed the monarch				14068.84079330408
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel				14469.106103490927
mordaunt cried the three friends tis mordaunt but athos exclaimed d artagnan				1.0057064295604672
in fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement				77116.66206504265
mademoiselle de villefort my step daughter said madame de villefort to monte cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand				9.693820944858015
we must never look for discretion in first love				639.195784949376
the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne dust of the earth				311.1757533359621
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor				425.54246944879554
if she flies kill her but don t exceed your orders an expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning				1579.2285295080947
at length his eyes opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless then sight returned and with it feeling and grief				735.3808489988447
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse				1372.0195778565817
the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when danglars stopped her				9.80344561487176
well then a good journey to you said caderousse				35.130020282210964

i could never agree to it still you have thought of it incessantly alas cried the abb√©				30.645287982321648
oh cried edmond to think that in half an hour i could join her did i not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles				650.7481566276189
an instant after porthos and aramis re entered the surgeon and m de tr√©ville alone remaining with the wounded				8703.709498401266
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat				178.35924444956788
at the end of the second day m de villefort received the following note the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment he is also known to the abb√© busoni a sicilian priest of high repute in the east where he has done much good m de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abb√© who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small two storied house behind saint sulpice there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant				4366.244576929219
the hand of god caderousse continued to call piteously help reverend sir help what is the matter asked monte cristo				1.0053448678818429
scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye				297.8844972277477
for his father s death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of merc√©d√®s				984.0426832287382
i thought i recognized him and i was not mistaken whom do you mean asked aramis				32.66364088982516
what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it but when will that be when i am your wife the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day				264.4456544779229
go then and find them what shall i say to them by way of inducement to serve your eminence you know them better than i				1056.907363112848
we can not say how long the night seemed to milady but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness				1339.587635932191
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing				4557.1720700315545
well just as you like my prince there s liberty for all the world				378.84010849263643
my dear fellow i invited them to a dinner the next day replied aramis				9.18752980707286
by all means replied the governor and he signed to the turnkey to open the door				12.58663091221889
you offered me hospitality and i accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow				117.43106700590434
bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close				2659.021766736182
i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself				201.9194706001106
i will shape it out for you with my knife and he took the gibbet and shaped it out as neatly as possible				437.8898320859388
if i believed that i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles leaving the house to return to it no more fernand s eye darted lightning				24550.350427798217
as you see my health is but indifferent				9279.402206580695

and a comforting one too added d artagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man				1.071767210241702
d artagnan and athos took the nags of planchet and grimaud and the two lackeys started on foot carrying the saddles on their heads				1226.6936174645966

she thanked them both with a smile				202.40560856046187
sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet he also was dying of hunger				1273.0305755394081

madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated i can sir said hayd√©e drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother s faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs a greenish pallor spread over the count s cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence				545.876088538439

on entering the house he had taken off his mask and imitation beard then mounting a staircase had opened a door and in a room lighted by a single lamp found himself face to face with a man seated behind a desk				942.0067567837599
he replied he replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what to poison indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness				2090.028010217947

i wish you to do so said he				8.266799782054106
he must know where his master is without a doubt he must d artagnan thought for a moment then took his sword and put on his cloak to go out				30.795678230591292
and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted				2803.215244193773

meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good				922.2396508169379
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire				2849.983797779353
and you have a letter yes there it is give it to me then and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read				1900.430430593459

alas sir i never had any opinions				23979.08079373087
d artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding				4994.755789158686
nevertheless you come as one in authority because i happened to be in the ante chamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance				957.2971144397675
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity				1884.707184650912

lord de winter was not at home and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the evening				150.88178634528907
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them				9.634616527675584
d artagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward ah yes said a light horseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly				3868.5291683723217
d artagnan looked attentively at the building				3400.5222552163536
sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort				38.16268099868356
i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds well said aramis what do you say to that i say my dear d herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan the division being made by the light of bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis				33.52559955481761
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders				14.564602701128015
tr√©ville added the king in a low voice as the others were retiring as you have no room in the musketeers and as we have besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that corps place this young man in the company of the guards of monsieur dessessart your brother in law				9262.205829165314
m de tr√©ville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become darker				6012.358730750382
on perceiving the count he rose quickly				1096.0047941642408

his head supported by a long and flexible neck issued from his large black robe balancing itself with a motion very much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell				17262.328325370912
the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space				9689.690352650832
before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in				71.96554191120823
at that moment d artagnan passed in pursuit of milady he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look				241.90600279078893

the duchess was the first to speak				483.66276692162086

well i have not intercepted your confidence and yet i know all that as well as you and i have no conscientious scruples				21259.346770242195
milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward athos				210.30882013411497
monsieur d herblay she added turning toward aramis will you be my servant once more this evening how can you doubt it replied aramis this evening to morrow always command me i will then				152.42618857196175
bonacieux had made with him for that very evening but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero that the bad opinion entertained by m de tr√©ville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess				1595.1270265153976
this mysterious shade spread over his whole person rendered still more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth even in the most complete intoxication had never revealed anything however skillfully questions had been put to him				7.073496949790932
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob				15820.994962119441
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket				2935.0378041534354
his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert s grief stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men				3286.8434742120653
marie michon oh what do i not owe you aramis said d artagnan				1.005827665338939

the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals				12319.793537628273
what is his bearing mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth				287.90994036059135
the iron box was there no one had touched it under a beautiful fig tree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot				2113.891335490926
the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dant√®s question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port				782.2237666719104
m de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face				80.07102604198245
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea				846.4932424638097
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness				4151.846129824399
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england				84.27979130578066
but let us make haste sir with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with weakness				2961.6424613647446
all was dark one solitary feeble light was burning in the porter s lodge about forty paces distant from the house as baptistin had said				706.0830844817085
the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abb√© s ladder of cords				24337.192364648166
they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from acting				20594.931750313113

the queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious				5258.706193010665
i will ask the cardinal it was the cardinal then who informed you of this f√™te yes madame replied the astonished king but why do you ask that it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs that is to say madame it was he sire it was he well and what does it signify whether it was he or i				1277.280782460186
the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn but of what sort eh				2137.1444284443055
on guard but said he whom d artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st germain or in the pr√© aux clercs what you say is full of sense replied d artagnan but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely				6223.138403360001
m bonacieux was at his door				79.63136338712684

be silent i will write aramis accordingly took the quill reflected for a few moments wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand and then with a voice soft and slow as if each word had been scrupulously weighed he read the following my lord the person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the rue d enfer				316.6331459564921
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed ren√©e you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint m√©ran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past				229.66498634169005
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion baptistin entered and remained standing at the door				5.13861873682627
he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes				179.4301431155514

franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfred s shoulders or beneath lara s helmet				69990.48465187631
m de tr√©ville never jested in matters relating to discipline				10821.04866128128
jussac fell like a dead mass				7589.331475956136
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum				12861.78905151543
and why when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed might he not also be				791.4998511929724

from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize morrel				507.5061742239892
and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner the name of m noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange the father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics				1193.6181714816596

as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his maneuvers oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis				14.868955168645902

oh no dear count cried aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to what do you mean aramis that the place royale is the termination to the main road to vendomois and nothing else what				653.4321940491204
first m and madame de saint m√©ran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixir three drops were sufficient then followed barrois the old servant of m noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous he gave her the same dose as the others and all was over for her as well as the rest why what nonsense are you telling us said ch√¢teau renaud				1.3368569782988922
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg of you monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m villefort entered				64.65734529533819

they both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak				114.59711772220366
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir				92.33062113033367
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect				18479.725885019074
what a gourmand you are growing i haven t seen you with so cheerful a face these five years the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramee s ideas grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him				7.7796791920606685
the procureur exerted himself to reply				679.9442457215184
this noirtier was his father had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dant√®s or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words				2574.4351979978424

i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing danger my lord exclaimed d artagnan with a look of astonishment what danger i am told that there is a general insurrection the uniform of the king s musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns did you witness the injury sustained by comminges monsieur de comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers which means i suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards the cardinal smiled as he spoke				1045.031443816883
yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abb√© s gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays 0327m so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abb√© for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases you are wrong to speak thus said the abb√© and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error what mean you inquired caderousse with a look of surprise				1468.5836317745204
monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter				10295.143586050202
bonacieux was going that was to follow her				11.358213940313856
albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume				181.82469052832855
that s too many gentlemen too many				30794.829494028825
well he asked that will do will it not yes my lord on one condition what that grimaud shall wait on us at table nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud				6831.802286884885
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts				97050.47181924795
but his temper cooled down like his friend s he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it so much the better said athos				5.327025584598179

does your majesty remember when playing in the park of fontainebleau or in the palace courts at versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder yes certainly well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire				580.2602752045807
immediately m de tr√©ville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms				192.21967503314804
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eels all light wholesome food suitable for the sick but the wine said d artagnan who furnishes the wine				809.1782064132226
oh tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail				9731.233422095303
yes madame replied the coadjutor i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced				195331.82594696633
the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head				256.81955025338436
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions				5314.821466466758
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers				1663.5567966921499
the people were shouting and running about with torches				15709.990939909701
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke				436.6067471957865
when we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been				1931.3227450125614
i will take him dead that s all a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse				9803.161405923915
i know the world is a drawing room from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid that is to the purpose				220.71736924411582
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest				4994.889165308202
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door				60.73665307733572
because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates on your honor is that true cried albert				68.71287562097707

why did you not tell me so before				311.47280373292205
on entering the room noirtier s eyes met those of the abb√© and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room				32.22166601404739
the hangings were of damask the carpets from alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine lady s couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain heaven by fasting and mortification				19706.641219326462
let us not lose a moment the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game				11912.488683118085
merc√©d√®s read with terror the following lines the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dant√®s second in command on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo is the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris				22.67622793455058
you foolish fellow said athos laughing				37.32545883405296
i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your father s favor and that i might do him justice				1627.6789721128087
he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property				842.9575004266397
coquenard did not seem to observe it				6.6372624660333175
what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself chapter 90				1412.7346130989688
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon				272.1404991196971
these people who are looking at us are only merchants said athos and are looking more at the cargo than at us i shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and i shall make for the dunes as soon as possible sandy hills about dunkirk from which it derives its name				6960.94902589023
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously				16908.50216796261
suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man				1.357779958722014
adieu madame replied the king s attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door				39.91116056652235
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat				1893.4754484019752
this is the second or third time monsieur that you have repeated that name and yet i have told you that i do not know him you do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked				8592.649560868324
she calculated that to cross this corner of france and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days				925.7035180468896
on my right i saw the tree behind me the rock				5001.328798010197

the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs				4729.417805089959
do you not remember him yes said dant√®s and without relinquishing merc√©d√®s hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air				103.17129715660718

wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished then only she pretended to hear the sound of felton s steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees				136.5486948276285
danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee				16888.083872434498
to eat do you hear are you hungry come you understand me what would your excellency like to eat a piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place bread				3879.29478978843
where then could he be if he had entered his mother s room and not since returned				614.3332121680911

yes you have a recipe for it an infallible one that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink yes said monte cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed may we inquire what is this recipe asked debray				152.1078814400175
the queen saving us her friends nothing more moral				14599.620865362564
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures				3990.279030198521
de saint m√©ran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression she appeared to be stupefied				1343.4731195873271
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a music room for julie who never played				2938.792357118039
m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character				6625.677846253862
baron danglars one two three four five said monte cristo five millions why what a cr≈ìsus you are this is how i transact business said danglars				60.28118333900868

we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected				6286.234940499861
the host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two friends				58.51306758484722

you have purchased it dearly enough d artagnan left athos s chamber and went to that of porthos				279.80790053199286
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes				4017.462033463214

the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father s faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death				166.29278185985896
if at this moment the sweet voice of ren√©e had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair merc√©d√®s had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefort s valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness				81397.38194795605

in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion				3067.940791918423
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd				1077.748367788279

we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to speak				69.05605695221114

who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m de richelieu who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine my friends monsieur the queen shook her head				6.074286369302546

i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutter yes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to d artagnan i was not speaking to you sir but i am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn				1888.559342638645

shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dant√®s				2529.1487085469125
without me you would both have died				6041.280715084416
is it you baron said he				5.165578633847996

pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly				55.22993610113775
i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife do you think so i am sure of it and you have heard his fortune mentioned nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing and what is your opinion i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression well and it is that my opinion is that all these old podest√†s these ancient condottieri for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces my opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land very little at least i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca ah he has a palace said danglars laughing come that is something yes and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house				211.4869236499588
oh the train is well laid the plot is clever				5257.116648802393

it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first				345.6693997502507
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved him i love him				39.28956632914572
at ten o clock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented				12247.713194775344
in the country people alter one gets to like without knowing it all those beautiful objects that god causes to spring from the earth which are despised in cities				10286.889778442717

but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered				2477.1752359190036
when we arrive at the summit of our wishes success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes				1273.4488867380544
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated				5356.209851042695
as to getting him drunk the duke couldn t hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it				20.372800194996486
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god				1221.7748591603386
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her embarkation				4727.3615443537865
it was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached				8801.898042697077
a spent ball not even that what is it then we have said that athos loved d artagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man				1.0810251269174447
and besides he said going out of this chamber isn t all dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday				327.46271672802254
well what have you to say				130.5857707737441
and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver				360.3692884022979
you see he has a truly royal escort ay there s no fear in the daytime but at night we redouble our precautions and what method of surveillance do you employ eight men remain constantly in his room the deuce he is well guarded then				3821.469057710971
see i have thought about you look at the good breakfast we are going to have nothing but what you are fond of andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to proven√ßal kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves				2463.8622929393086
but de winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying my god i thank thee that he knows me only chapter xli				3641.9532401341794
my good nanette be quiet i beseech you said broussel				2686.3441309343884
then we are once more reunited said andrea				88.1860927629649
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man				353.6725505681908
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise				7845.027375622336
ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty really count replied franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly				77.64869832335573
concerning a court intrigue chapter ix				2177.932861708538
he sends me for that purpose and here i am the poor woman s head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees				141.74721508034156
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner				934.3284298500381
as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous				6742.570032260338
i like everyone and you include me in the expression everyone many thanks let us not mistake said monte cristo i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor as christians but i thoroughly hate but a few				40151.77411282353
give it to me the captain gave him a loaded carbine the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the air				241.44066855276364
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the world your valise is then empty asked porthos with simplicity				18895.34934622516
d avrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips				58.380909543044666
a friend maximilian and who is this friend				448.1781250436821
that time you had nothing to say to me i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second				300.1741689204101
happily for him he has ceased to bear that name and therefore said d artagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abb√© d herblay				3.359279199752024
she is to correspond with nobody she is to speak to no one but you if you will do her the honor to address a word to her that is sufficient my lord				9.296851270872008
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely				833.8461779013772
laugh then said monsieur de retz they are looking at us and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group				29256.508641977307
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria				32.618620569091306
there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse				2110.6229633927815
are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo				38092.48918890163
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie				1881.3651956772503
he is dead villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy dead and so soon too yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him but that ought not to astonish you monsieur and madame de saint m√©ran died as soon				5122.158909642918
his grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious				4447.853956866601
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship				433.63561724463597
without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it for all my tears my cares my exile and my chains i have my youth my prayers and god who counts my pains her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination				1389.3487420589652
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend s ear				590.7114329769222
we are all mortal my poor friends you are late my dear porthos yes there were some people on the way who delayed me				4.969519234842057
well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him				51.77256177249484
the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor andrea cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune				10375.364964584598
the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him				4.362134688474219
five minutes after andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus				17125.7704691072
his excellency the count of monte cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion they resolved to profit by the count s courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained				8191.472876047999
i have no business in london but others wish that you should go there but who are those others				2857.0183823798984
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me				1548.2855006454429
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken				1260.9026228388284
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier				927.0653853556163
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand				979.0197901603951
well if you will have the truth and me too said athos				8.281259540331234
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abb√© busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo				1.0043058397652462
de saint m√©ran whose sole heiress i am				103.08337235984558
the telegraph m and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawing room and was still awaiting them there				523.1013136975173
there were two means of gaining his object to search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the trench				132995.16412358746
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness				4730.175600275383
fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your embrace				6076.962408654164
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars				10.041580898923241
i own i was seeking them why when all was arranged listen count the affair is serious and unavoidable did you doubt it no the offence was public and everyone is already talking of it well well i hoped to get an exchange of arms to substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is blind have you succeeded asked monte cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hope				1609.0404518405808
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch				2602.8809304980023
if they recognize you you are lost care not for me sire think only of yourself				154.97154212270473
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity				2855.6945019877753
what is he waiting for asked another				2465.0726970820865
a burning fire a red hot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my shoulder felton uttered a groan				1090.7635098739688
20 the performance of the civil marriage				3959.445435612042
i possess nearly 50 000 livres in right of my mother my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de saint m√©ran will leave me as much and m noirtier evidently intends making me his heir				2039.6820196440303
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done				189.6411116595613
what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame de villefort the world however is mistaken my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile hate you sweet valentine exclaimed the young man how is it possible for anyone to do that alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my stepmother s aversion to me arises from a very natural source her overweening love for her own child my brother edward but why should it i do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation i will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of m and mme				52.66315491511084
he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to act				831.3735433946488
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity				8464.048771077016
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper				4948.943495763987
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn				4356.050592074761

mademoiselle eug√©nie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d armilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events				4975.358999124038
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him				8.507623132619145

at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry				2325.6531219828253
as to that we know d artagnan s courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle				23.953159936776796
then when the cardinal had ended alas sir				243.46731886817423
he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen				78.20409962704792
locusta and agrippina living at the same time were an exception and proved the determination of providence to effect the entire ruin of the roman empire sullied by so many crimes				1798.5665302291047

the manda√Øa 6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer				9281.393563922624

monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy can not survive without the countenance of monarchs				196316.569846805
if it is i whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner i reply that i hold monsieur le marechal s opinion in every respect the color mounted to the queen s face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger				504.3648829136341

then he had a moment s hesitation				1672.1762468471284
and why so asked porthos warmly				245.18025044943818
years of suffering in my opinion count double and i have suffered for twenty years ah yes i understand said mazarin want of fortune perhaps				1300.2557037888273
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house				17.119179968325966

they are men who do nothing for nothing you know the only reply that i desire said d artagnan the only one worthy of you and of me and he drew nearer to her				9.336445207056265
it is not at all amusing here there is not a single woman passing hush said athos we are overheard in truth the walker who during the observations of the two friends had passed and repassed behind them several times stopped at the name of de winter but as his face betrayed no emotion at mention of this name it might have been by chance he stood so still				971.1240435427978

they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m de tr√©ville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions				757.0850462549546
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment				2586.926634399928
unfortunately he was an honorable man he married her				85.18912712726103

so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hour s time he stopped before a little isolated house				254.31744716224824
oh no edmond it is myself that i blame myself that i hate				8419.689000750397

athos set the lackeys to work first because since these men had been in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them different and essential qualities				1408.7401706187652
sometimes he weeps bitterly sometimes laughs boisterously at other time he passes hours on the seashore flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes duck and drake five or six times he appears as delighted as if he had gained another marengo or austerlitz				2271.0093518351537
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if i had employed it for another purpose i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy				39275.3342852234
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a calotte was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio				5529.534350485039
by the way i have received news of franz have you				374.369001925744

he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts and then went back and listened				1576.7665206243157
the cardinal folded and sealed his letter				175.65400141331307
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty one years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master				611.2490310334076
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dant√®s knew that he had escaped the first peril				20219.812519928328
the name he pronounced in a voice of tenderness amounting almost to love was that of hayd√©e				2830.5692748366764
at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder				27456.38652588651

the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious				2840.7712578507353
then the iron hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept				368.1544601350454
everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order				2053.858993708001
patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent				3272.2843531317644

the heart of d artagnan swam in delirium he marched between athos and porthos pressing them tenderly				2542.9902322421426
danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dant√®s and when napoleon returned to france he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of providence				637.2833368293857
my poor friend i had forgotten you were in love well but said aramis have you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent				624.4361716891054
and why not demanded d artagnan				1.0092777011072054
how is that my friend why thus it is replied dant√®s				85.10500127340228
i am a frondist from my heart				784.3602009264265
because said debray albert sent this morning to request us to come beauchamp and ch√¢teau renaud exchanged looks of astonishment				231.34169501951982
as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party discontented sir				246.14560994774214

but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti				425.5899540819789
albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered				16570.254281130456
you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host good night and mounted the stairs				127.90305357515471
this is not his writing said athos				7.335691766926643
she did not therefore even attempt the least resistance and went out of the cottage				46057.246039079175

d artagnan made his way through the crowd advanced toward the host and pronounced the word forward the host instantly made him a sign to follow went out with him by a door which opened into a yard led him to the stable where a saddled horse awaited him and asked him if he stood in need of anything else				367.4481996920964

it is the longest road but certainly the most amusing d artagnan was on the point of telling athos all but one consideration restrained him				2.8100463538251685
athos always carried the key of this coffer about him but he one day opened it before porthos and porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and papers love letters and family papers no doubt				1346.7667231722444
they returned to the hotel at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight				359.8186267921866

valentine rose to fetch the dictionary				4131.591335387599
if i am caught i risk nothing but being taken back again to prison				2326.797848093338
this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle which was determined he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war				378.67196528482305
a loud cry could be heard by her				38.572827381133855
we lived together we loved we hated together we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably i may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship perhaps there may be the bond of crime for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life				257.1277246826937
he was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive oil				3017.6818749634417

m and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfather s presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid				957.058864228122
why what has happened to you are you going to make me ring a second time for the carriage asked monte cristo in the same tone that louis xiv				557.6706837794001
when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it you will further say to him watch over his grace lord buckingham for they wish to assassinate him				2.9569054961232246
taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in heart free in mind into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie				1352.8768364477041
uncertainty is worse than all go on with the lights said the inspector				43.19190672595514
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first which must much diminish the face value of your bill monsieur porthos and render yours almost null monsieur aramis				105.558422193703
ah said mordaunt with a sneer there s one who is afraid zounds exclaimed d artagnan bounding toward him who says that athos is afraid let him have his say d artagnan said athos with a smile of sadness and contempt				4766.838390244761
baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address				1186.9367723236721

yes said he i came quickly i wanted to speak to you are all your family well asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt				831.1987362341248
the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain				10033.531339705693
welcome among us your excellency he said to him you heard what the count just said and also my reply let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your friend s ransom that this had happened but said franz looking round him uneasily where is the viscount i do not see him nothing has happened to him i hope said the count frowningly				1929.0981479720213
you have once before thrown yourself in my path				9926.894110226403
d artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him				19.179164741765693
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful				804.0450532222557
faithful friend noble heart said the king i should not have been rescued				3839.1269363248134
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris				109.22124410363975
are you a doctor yes the best you could have at the present time believe me but you say you have watched said valentine uneasily where have you been i have not seen you the count extended his hand towards the library				10904.972775627077
ten kicks on his back said d artagnan be off you little villain and forget not that i have your address friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the quai a la rue dauphine and disappeared				157.35465349919255
at the door of the chapel d artagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for athos but athos had disappeared				29.25089126220636
what our enemies say of us is then true				69.07548749675138
milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition				2595.0598046989176
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that d artagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queen s letter and for which he had repaid m de wardes with such terrible coin				2570.9377271539693
a vision at four o clock the four friends were all assembled with athos				226.4226386962421
anticipating your wishes i have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages and ali he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the boy with a smiling air will have the honor of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash				7572.190156455182
we should command an annuity of 175 000 livres				1378.5308283450108
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly				31072.220916644575
the country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald				6695.779702697424
athos was then sent to the cardinal but unfortunately the cardinal was at the louvre with the king				59.71230406363583
the standard very well in half an hour we shall be on board and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england what do you say of that young man asked d artagnan as they hurried along				39333.28378126176
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution				4524.399512111531
now my wife came home four days ago monsieur				274.0562083327332
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i thought i had exhausted them all then count of monte cristo my pretended benefactor then count of monte cristo the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the death of your friend and morrel with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the pistols				1817.1964536600315
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed				569.9016218839254
bah said porthos why separate since we are all together because you can and ought to return to france your mission is accomplished but ours is not your mission is not accomplished exclaimed d artagnan looking in astonishment at athos				10.656684353093077
there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society				16549.770945996544
very good said groslow and opened the door of the room				67.20543586674775
if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through for i never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos				94.74205150884862
then he said to himself i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody				178098.43914636734
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de m√©dicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik that is just said richelieu				4353.355315693412
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape				1479.6622480599963
what is it then mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance				172.0936601108091
when the name of colonel fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial				2126.668672372691
i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet				273816.1496453038
it is he who has raised all this revolt the more reason said mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal the queen sprang to the window				73.74642185382366
when you please replied beauchamp allow me only to compliment m de morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity oh yes said ch√¢teau renaud				1.2936778063305012
who s up there said the man				270.20171629956377
i am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in france				59.79844014656873
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity				693.9245012807474
england needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch				20490.941505664126
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point				4039.718468825651
athos gave raoul some of the holy water				1919.8042085479092
d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise which was not quite free from joy				230.12781510948358
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table what are the two fish asked danglars				63.89864064996541
it was fourteen years day for day since dant√®s arrest				1827.7541961607858
now if you are mad and try to bite me i will kill you without pity				1116.185180942555
he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons				6681.249110898484
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly				273.9562562236975
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor				143.96403107767085
yes yes continued lord de winter i understand				154.3600047032341
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness you re a great moralist and that s the fact said porthos				9.309463075735508
is your name bonacieux said he				5.117269775648154
buckingham left alone walked toward a mirror				40660.34203186108
the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions claws				3239.02565456649
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him				3.6290419299194023
this is something new replied the king				24.189509474832715
and now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjuteur it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release broussel from prison and give him back to the people oh cried anne to humble myself thus				522.6762013153716
madame bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is found no athos no you are mistaken said d artagnan i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies but i am ignorant				969.878264148928
then it is for to day asked the king				20.32809942492457
but my lord tell me she continued hide nothing from me what is in truth the king s position				1231.8741646780534
however she offered the cardinal laporte s place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other				89.04564412714271
he is calling you said the count he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom death would have separated you calls you to him				132.20668749040948
as to the second reproach i have heard it said that she does not love the english but an englishman well and by my faith said athos it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being loved				2636.623726237672
breathing that sea breeze so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy all the power of that army which she was to combat alone she a woman with a few bags of gold milady compared herself mentally to judith the terrible jewess when she penetrated the camp of the assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots horses men and arms which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke				2511.082656626979
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets				804.5958020897605
the countess had this portrait painted during the count s absence				941.6730723158764
the next morning danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at all				306.43791185539595
i have nothing to give you my son but fifteen crowns my horse and the counsels you have just heard				620.0591120566564
the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves				3486.3628330770825
he recognized the influence of merc√©d√®s and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless				339.36652792630355
listen then to the supplication of a despairing woman				109.84884261833841
at least i am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and i repeat that i am really interested for the count you asked milady				44.21216751443759
afraid of making any inquiries at this house d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras				20715.603795524
but we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little better				707.0989247794201
as he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to turn				26343.554682857095
has this woman been relating her crimes to you				29.65995108538323
d artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said here my dear athos this naturally belongs to you athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles				571.9526703977745
the man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her journey				494.6711432236993
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition				5812.824545694583
yes if i die well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right				57.31842534881132
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence d artagnan went straight to the residence of athos				230.65150964744333
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude				28202.708807770727
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither				1909.1853567813262
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction an admirable subject cried the jesuit				275.4526742470735
m de tr√©ville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news				3233.251334424935
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost mad what will not reality do but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you which asked the young man				1.133693808261679
he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field				5443.298111484434
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort s for the purpose of returning the procureur s visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion				748.4360221094516
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am				125.4413862684303
it was very hard the horse said morcerf laughing				67.54121722711142
at length m de tr√©ville himself returned				857.1443316635067
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled				727.5422613950194
come your excellency the count added turning to franz here is luigi vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet him				1.6395007408380735
i wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody i agree monsieur but do not be too confident				12943.97485129329
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priest s wig the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abb√©				3358.293740727768
if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost for a man so well off will never change his happy condition and i shall fail with him as i have already done with aramis chapter xi				4963.979594323609
that is another thing said porthos				8.944255018722428
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft the duke had already begun to descend				3082.469579677287
ah exclaimed d avrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery				5345.330488867414
the past is another thing said athos sighing the past and the future are you afraid for your young raoul asked aramis				8.95185839515501
they are soldiers though resumed de bragelonne				160.20666740335895
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream				777.1059554976282
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her i cried buckingham				259.481719855704
d artagnan he said you are here to night still infuriated by yesterday s adventure				701.3085857206177
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar				751.1396360679043
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while mme				83.92223805383301
come he said if i pay you the 100 000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease certainly said peppino				2048.342845039303
an explanation at the opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good				1113.097685165123
but √† propos resumed m de tr√©ville what has become of your three companions i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them none monsieur well i left them on my road porthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands aramis at cr√®vec≈ìur with a ball in his shoulder and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining see there now said m de tr√©ville and how the devil did you escape by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry there again				450.3924630597667
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the left				974.5865413673329
ask my beloved sister hayd√©e who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day while talking to me of you you then love hayd√©e asked monte cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate				25369.81752976631
it wants ten minutes to nine said he				12.047320245223085
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk				1236.0677102136278
yes it is very annoying said vampa but we have not seen him then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared				77.68914100865415
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said				35.03869385613675
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted				2631.875638781891
this lasted several minutes until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the stairs				50.22464354929859
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts				8950.702543668627
ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him				3.406231136472671
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme				212.93312015590013
what my maid tells me but what does she tell you that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge				12340.018522385186
merc√©d√®s is not yet your wife				476.90140005797986
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back				303.46527275416037
in a few hours they were in the capital				3026.674249954082
meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of louis xi his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of robespierre he repeated this maxim of tristan s gossip divide in order to reign henry iv when besieging paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls				3428.0068164847007
have you a name then i bear that of your brother ay but you are mistaken				207.37998045701698
the insult at the banker s door beauchamp stopped morcerf				105.70630683514011
in the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman s happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings				38594.29243631654
who is this creature grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time				35.37233048091831
among these two hundred levees that of tr√©ville was one of the most sought				2194.769695016844
adieu gentlemen and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away				29.93943769027625
is she not free to love whomsoever she will oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing				104.42458712232072
concerning a court intrigue in the meantime the forty pistoles of king louis xiii like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed				3796.2022542908676
but your wife monsieur what has she to do with all this her devotion to the queen is known and they wish either to remove her from her mistress or to intimidate her in order to obtain her majesty s secrets or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy that is likely said d artagnan but the man who has abducted her do you know him i have told you that i believe i know him his name i do not know that what i do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil genius but you have seen him yes my wife pointed him out to me one day has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him oh certainly he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his temple a scar on his temple cried d artagnan and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriage why that s my man of meung he is your man do you say yes yes but that has nothing to do with it				8.383232481187774

in france people fight with the sword or pistol in the colonies with the carbine in arabia with the dagger				920.1193793458038
for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns without reckoning the value of that diamond he cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to d artagnan which is worth at least ten thousand francs he returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gun fire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through paris				90.30225063005358
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners				2337.4790723220735
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste				7311.414246045867

he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said my worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions				5792.371683501218

ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested				25284.94020466508
danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well				170.5693632267413
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future				179.86084967530587

morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit				537.1870917213819
but at the first word the young woman started and exclaimed in a sharp bantering tone which sounded strangely in the darkness are you afraid dear monsieur d artagnan you can not think so dear love replied d artagnan but now suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think him at all events said milady seriously he has deceived me and from the moment he deceived me he merited death he shall die then since you condemn him said d artagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of devotion				3342.171646051714
he resembles his mother so he opened the door and beckoned the young man in				1163.2957425649886
between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover				2954.698250370825

a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on hayd√©e seemed one of fire and blood				1984.4105219971098
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak				113.20829610448786

they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letters from the island of elba ought to have informed them franz interrupted himself by saying my father was a royalist they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known and hence said villefort arose my affection for your father my dear m franz				145.59603665439167
hayd√©e took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes				11551.839330877901

the point aimed at by every poniard				31077.525636858496

my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious				17317.88015096008

he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier				2106.597088311334
monsieur the cardinal cried the stupefied musketeer				465.3604432287001
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving d artagnan learned that he exercised from six o clock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine o clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern				7973.70744425643
these keys were given up to him instantly				2280.6198063762645

as i came into the public room i saw one of our englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from bleeding				35361.10234002217
the invalid s eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable				7907.438949902226
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd				564.9106277659017
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her				27.922910252262913
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind				37.38400727613807
you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart				170.01929685638905
as to athos he remained unmoved				4755.994867223864
but there is nothing which would do nothing 40114m oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help				713.5489128789978
bonacieux what is that noise that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness				539.0715606262141
never mind i ll fix that all right				144.45321792294027
the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse				255.67086995449026
is this that bonacieux asked he after a moment of silence				116.68128338256912
but if i am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint it is a bad year for kings said gondy shaking his head look at england madame yes but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france replied the queen				7504.22585465389
is it large middling how is it arranged faith i should require pen ink and paper to make a plan they are all here said caderousse briskly				135.69839278680115
the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive				5221.1525006780075
i have only two adversaries i will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even them they are time and distance				3292.8893600626184
madame i never eat muscatel grapes replied monte cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before				688.9792030276966
they passed into the eating room a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen				1721.8116450755706
a priest can understand a father s grief and m de villefort giving the key to d avrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work				361.16215823218863
by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things what have you done oh nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor well monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the post				2088.9499638799443
the four old friends prepare to meet again				441.78324188940246
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple a cabbage for instance				1834.2674705507245
they descended into the plain by the ladder				1704.4318529978054
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let				12025.411298104817
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm then had gone toward aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair				1321.2665380479834
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty				2136.7847270520533
he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and bone				2856.8440091380235
have you really met with some great misfortune oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which i have sustained nothing worth mentioning i assure you true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all 900 000 francs are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood 30183m what do you say said the count 900 000 francs				2010.5891188465528
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house				119.85966978431014
why just remember what they said				52.08074314548743
pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion indiscretion oh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject				195.50372882450407
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do				844.0764769807677
upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon				592.3824237651299
light the candles in my apartment if you please the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light				444.321781975665
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner				2849.5394465599084
the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel s keel floated at the foot of the crag				2014.632281205591
take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of				679.6839447458127
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel				697.2639010795339
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy				4521.548325682138
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead				2862.640804414981
maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word				42.01707030749423
how pale you are the abominable creature murmured d artagnan				1.0108629461448067
in two bounds he was at the louvre as he entered the wicket of l echelle ten o clock struck				77.59488149081146
come in gentlemen come in called d artagnan you are here in my apartment and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party				1561.376343566908
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel				4172.184306112485
gentlemen thus d artagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him				4.160628288781739
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur				2477.2992659899264
what is your sister valentine doing inquired madame de villefort of edward tell someone to bid her come here that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count you have a daughter then madame inquired the count very young i presume the daughter of m de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine well grown girl but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat				239.61625720096475
he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces				7809.428634080334
suppose a watchman should pass and he blew out the light				489.4471091342887
nobody knows who she is or where she comes from				2435.849585547277
well where the devil are you going now cried athos				9.035554955803143
the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain				359.4770118771733
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then d artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter				117.72299782124851
come in tr√©ville the duke saluted and retired				526.1184064415828
i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit				1561.7441808843616
tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them				155.68093855365777
the valet opened the door and villefort heard someone speak his name				67.94272854240523
oh yes said buckingham grating his teeth with rage				364.53515342106357
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise				2454.037771440025
and will you direct us exclaimed the young man				1.1842772933470163
at this announcement during which the door remained open everyone became mute and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel				9021.61785139755
it was three o clock when he threw himself on the bed				280.25308593954225
do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control				3890.899208308799
i have doubtless i am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out only by their passports they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter				638.9940442887255
having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal s cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation				3925.3745651486315
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of d artagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits on seeing d artagnan rise porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other				57.78230498446178
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood				560.2867870822943
but to return to what we were saying				1361.4469521294411
i have only one thing to say to you				4.483896103138889
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple				6977.6515283446715
i remember just at his age how deep in love i was with a grecian statue which our good king then henry iv gave my father insomuch that i was mad with grief when they told me that the story of pygmalion was nothing but a fable it is mere want of occupation				5359.842927344992
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded				2605.1904941860207
was faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to faria				1732.3718852038821
really sir d artagnan said to him i am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue				1904.3673928786334
i gave her good advice by which she did not profit				56163.4688918596
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear				414.41459621097096
but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust well such things have been that there should be a famine recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans so much the better				690.6900127146494
ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us d artagnan then related all the mad passion of milady and her menaces of death				128.4653842611353
the major recovered his self possession				342.68528728116485
the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely				2113.3511262101642
can they have received any news my lord not from england madame				293.62261560999764
he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood				8051.25838407789
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man				2.5508842164169137
i will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will say m de la tr√©mouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it				17.405417053740226
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an avenger you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes				27431.31327761733
he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as d artagnan had so often done formerly				88301.43675183132
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer				1477.7521255643176
tis god who gives them into our hands answered groslow				219.11442414821957
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one it s true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist				547.226599910391
like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures				5794.217005437533
the father of m de tr√©ville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money a thing to which the b√©arnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready wit in default of money we repeat he authorized him after the reduction of paris to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules with the motto fidelis et fortis				2938.1366100035716
from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them				13.520822177854134
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation				240.68454380674106
well if you do not go this very instant i will have you arrested by the queen s orders and i will have you placed in the bastille which you dread so much bonacieux fell into a profound reflection				1719.1781747393559
nothing at all that s a capital arrangement				12758.862402765948
she has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left yes the fleur de lis is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices yes but you say she is english she is called milady but she may be french				534.7229550101538

not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy				1688.6633878815867
the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchid s troops that is to say with our enemies				1876.8724849070775
d artagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind it				12.901778615860012
yes i recognize it d artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt				6946.27356499373
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole				1238.619508659365
your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is yes i do sir in the donjon of vincennes yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm sir replied mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him but he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the mall sir those amusements are allowed but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission no no cried mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement				1702.7048508510773

thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees				414.85272759547917
a table ready set out awaited them				14.234973735832066
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt				339.74524207419796
the door being closed the four friends waited in expectation				827.4936487849006

but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon				640.3922988410582
behind d artagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red cloak				117.44825888158114

he must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell				754.9573825175268
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband				150.01489034040716
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves				28859.514434479694

that s a snare said athos don t go d artagnan and yet replied d artagnan i think i recognize the writing it may be counterfeit said athos				6.51213732832568
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino				902.9334064710955
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty				1672.491232039011
but contrary to all expectation when the 31st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision				1769.089812002696
the count praised bertuccio s zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month				1423.6274562490867

while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father				143.400580375005
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst d artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left				585.0232847756862

give it to me said d artagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate				1070.6771333370455
planchet addressed the officer with a fine flemish phrase the officer replied in words that belonged to no language at all and the bargain was concluded madeleine s brother entered d artagnan s service				157.14859909434597
depend on my care to see that your youth is not blighted or suffered to pass away in ungenial solitude and of this be well assured that if you love me as a father i love you as a child you are wrong my lord				4.472006484435478

it seems you must always be playing some game or other yes and that reminds me that i have a revenge to take				490.763776884259
well sir replied eug√©nie i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eug√©nie				290.7102427220205
te deum for the victory of lens				2685.895836298576

the queen gave them to me the queen requires them again				755.1337990757005
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglars so be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned				2342.969326619546
behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her				16.956682638729212

i am afraid that remaining at blois would be dangerous to his youthful mind				143.66490231753633
assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased				4006.1677927008986
then you can let me have some money can you not whatever you say my dear count i am at your orders why replied monte cristo since we mutually understand each other for such i presume is the case danglars bowed assentingly				9296.32020775633
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages				204049.54026252363

blacas remain ah sir said the minister of police to villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by luck s door your fortune is made will it be long first muttered villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackney coach				245.54282563140927
the matter had been named to him by d artagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the danger				1185.7047174463335
it was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of saint m√©ran had regained the good graces of her grandfather and that she would ultimately be in possession of an income of 300 000 livres				300.62251345307953
excuse my putting such a question to you it is not indiscreet returned morcerf with the simplicity of conviction				2571.4011661646873
then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him				3.462955075132923
yet i am sure she is not happy said caderousse				33.842658019311784

that great giant who was there gave it to him in that case said bazin he must be pretty sick so sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him to be sure the coadjutor has promised who told you that monsieur maillard himself you have seen him then certainly i was there when he fell what were you doing there i was shouting down with mazarin death to the cardinal the italian to the gallows isn t that what you would have me shout be quiet you rascal said bazin looking uneasily around				277.99802832274776

my mother gave it to me and i fool as i was instead of keeping the ring as a holy relic gave it to this wretch then my friend take back this ring to which i see you attach much value i take back the ring after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature				20627.364676047062

the sum was collected in a minute				3483.700641413542
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was something				638.1956303228792
he remained on the bench with his back leaning against the wall and his hands hanging down exactly on the spot where the guards placed him				2.6621227498391704
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall				46.08342753279393
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours grimaud bowed in thanks				7507.325296924297
he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica				519.7313850519497
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate				5798.075295025956
it was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood for she bit her lips till they bled scratched the end of her nose and could not sit still in her seat				593.3874560454062
if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought i knew him he knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them i can answer for it by whom by me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information and what did you reply that i had none as yet but that i was to dine to day with two gentlemen who would be able to give me some you told him that said porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face				83.74179449258602
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated 10th april 1815 in which morrel by the deputy procureur s advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dant√®s had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort s certificates rendered indisputable				15456.639247762598
true said the abb√© with a stifled sigh merc√©d√®s it was go on urged caderousse				60.96279892588428
holloa said he what does that mean if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal				13.163582168598431
with three fingers to be sure one for the father one for the son and one for the holy ghost all crossed themselves				1747.9907880798035
they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year and that franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited italy should act as cicerone to albert				630.0215664175649
in truth said porthos i understand but now about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol				1997.412644939241
after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night				67.65196830323

but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty				322.3053357370001
we will try and carry him on board the tartan dant√®s declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him				4.744919880175013
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades				292210.2685805422
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter				104.40287940273792
my name must rest unknown replied franz merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks				6507.80759846957
d artagnan saw that the moment was come				598.1914689280401
he would no longer be alone				776.2611836129477
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are mine				1236.3636259423934

they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged				49797.71472301731
comminges who was on guard that night at the palais royal ran in				100.7143204045728

there as in every spot where monte cristo stopped if but for two days luxury abounded and life went on with the utmost ease				1042.8779773649444
what is it said d artagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance				945.938560129819
but as you are the strongest after all continued d artagnan don t be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked d artagnan with an eloquent look				75.94102167007921
yet you have unquestionably some ambition i have sir and what may it be i too as happens to every man once in his life have been taken by satan into the highest mountain in the earth and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the world and as he said before so said he to me child of earth what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me i reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then i replied listen i have always heard of providence and yet i have never seen him or anything that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists				109350.96052955351
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation				1166.3411564981259
buckingham the executioner of this angelic creature cried felton				52.77853148929699

valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven				497.5923511836617

unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all the fact is said d artagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotedness why i should be a ruined man no for porthos will pay you hum said the host in a doubtful tone				7.192180878090796

thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors				122525.56040180539
madame danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the bank notes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocket book and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of consolation				4333.237220051651

ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his life giving rays				12851.465260503923

milady was only a queen while among queens				113415.46297666573
and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it fernand became deadly pale				315.11639712867975

it is not i who strike m de morcerf it is providence which punishes him and why do you represent providence cried merc√©d√®s				465.32516228311164
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo				15727.964889786845

the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome				14296.772303925627
a table which had been covered with an elegant supper was overturned				39280.35369353277

all this she owes to d artagnan without doubt				2107.1496378370953

if you will permit me i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient masters warranted as such				32031.207546702844
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around i recognized the honest grimaud				1062.6662689224343
what ails you said he at length				13.71997900698732
four thousand nine hundred and ninety eight louis said peppino you have paid two louis in advance 50255m what				480.73644800466747
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark				1154.3452795931428
but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abb√© was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper				3787.364445384621
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them				11.315087028916269
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position				576.203861885664
you will be served thus madame three times a day said he				8.740534755227515

athos is near you said d artagnan warn him as i have warned you aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution				2850.543751789093
you came from a country where he must be very much talked of and i know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal my friend the cardinal cried milady seeing that on this point as on the other lord de winter seemed well instructed				17092.56625054389
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence				3087.9716711236106
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m				127.9089086463105
we are safe on that side said buckingham turning toward d artagnan				1.016582250616471
if there are two let parry kill one and you the other				113.891656167764
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze then in the midst of the songs of his sailors songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down he saw the island of monte cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city				878.4836432606534
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist				12316.128372881336
by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells				29986.946702945275
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father				145.3273301413503
do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences but who perpetrated that joke let me ask				156.71682248966732
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning				26.80186461658855
well i have ten thousand for you you are not boasting do you wish for a proof yes there were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and a third upon the rue saint denis				36.47886651307777
he then motioned to his wife to take leave				14524.33751597318
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal				59.9042925883534
everything is clear to me now				197.43039374967447
this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes				1426.5385726158745
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene				230.2397704966137
the door is opened to all who knock				22122.84183683424
a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and danglars sighed as m cavalcanti had done half an hour before				175.87526270832788
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes				138.8275211274297
i will go said comminges and if they come back fire not at all not at all replied d artagnan let no one move				938.0496964798451
i shall kill him i can not help it				7.8094390564348855
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coach houses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters				1759.922134202842
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that				48.66654749145783
am i to say what you told me asked valentine				33.65239388196351
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid				979.512889961103
gimblou a glass of wine well how has all gone off zounds				2012.9355248683526
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that d artagnan heard her in the antechamber				353.5017552329343
then i must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my departure porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice				6099.757965839959
what object think you have this expedition to r√© and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting				12868.230291765558
did you come from boulogne demanded she of milady				157.34617504993912
and he caused himself to be announced to the minister				972.6941859858129
edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with years and can not now remind my edmond by a smile or by a look of that merc√©d√®s whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating				8817.247512256388
but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself				148.1437743356099
you are not hurt asked d artagnan				1.008931278892572
de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror				215.32890149410255
the mind can see as well as the body				898.8601258579455
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo				1.0089718101589742
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor				46.63421545279884
have you informed him of it i wrote to him from boulogne				1637.5869118718817
scattering money round about him as heaven sprinkles rain				5118.0426179183405
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a duty you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive i indeed				67.91098629431897
only take care that i am not seen through the wicket oh it is a proof that the lord is on our side felton replied milady				38.10123246281952
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked				18755.028572479056
do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving				11718.601428826987
maximilian said he are your affections disengaged morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment				8.897196075039954
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness yes said the old man				1.1104301213080006
but why did she return to tours without telling me anything because she was in fear of being arrested why has she not written to me then because she was afraid of compromising you d artagnan you restore me to life cried aramis				31.13219321694246
i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money full dress said the major half aloud				2147.4628828966624
milady rushed to the door and opened it				15.299773729970152
0209m since my imprisonment said faria i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record				49938.152717926816
and then he was older than any of us added d artagnan				1.0056122541729113
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to d artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel				291.2195676990778
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked				4985.295180016483
that is no impediment sir said she i have had greater men than you arrested guitant mazarin sprang forward				2465.613457985978
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner				1814.2163835030642
when i become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not before be careful about this force open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and i may perhaps revive perhaps exclaimed dant√®s in grief stricken tones				9685.39432917261
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos				1645.8214366002558
if the musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed mme				72.93230686835979
the two rooms looked on to the street a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage				5791.1233858692185
i in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him thanks monsieur returned monte cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre is your steward also a nubian asked debray				108.12681883242564
we who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the place royale yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it				6.036134505050411
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman				117.87612051005257
thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover s arm				436.41317312185436
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the 21st of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o clock				2848.665893759462
i have written a letter today that letter is not yet gone				817.8487659667587
the vessel did touch at elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the island				6245.51135423962
it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light no valentine i assure you such is not the case				782.1044179031773
this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more				238.97111289299855
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris				30.97935451230187
in a few days you will be away from this place your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling				7792.622498960958
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued d artagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen aramis colored imperceptibly				358.0029850933358
and i also said d artagnan i also				160.79620080718757
and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse				2740.8353061603557
death is depicted on his face				31.13092399646607
what were you doing replied she				39.3718415935795
ah said the doctor is it you yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone				816.7084781572796
to lift their hands against a minister of god come here sir said urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other the wounded man smiled sadly				204.403019708298
and having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment he placed the others in the ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a talisman				33735.782690811706
the devil replied the prince surely at the death of mazarin				263.0308556201953
it is the declaration of cardinal spada and the will so long sought for replied edmond still incredulous				3839.1672105803823
i have 1 060 000 francs remaining he said				657.406604564147
this something was enveloped in a cloak and d artagnan at first believed it was a man but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a woman				497.14956424369666
oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that noirtier is the father of villefort i am lost and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts				268.8280255900333
it is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way if we have no news of them this evening to morrow we must start athos nodded affirmatively then turning and monsieur de bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the prince de cond√© has he the honor of being known to you diffident in allowing the sarcastic aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings				485.946287747565
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abb√© dant√®s spoke no more of escape				1095.9410368897768
my leave is at an end do you return to paris asked athos quickly				53.31500156023558
had entertained toward mazarin and he endeavored to receive the minister s homage with civility				1864.8426333471405

gentlemen he said the wood that i am carting is his i cut it in his copse and i am taking it to the chateau d artagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to planchet				127.92257152136749
at that moment the door opened				673.9377970316306

alas said andrea sighing one can not be completely happy in this world chapter 65				2524.184898635806

good day commander ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him				3.168327496482412
presently they heard milady retire to her room				297.6151646325133
but athos might be said to bear a charmed life				2320.872888441918
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair				1164.5300555975969
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances and now i am convinced said d artagnan that this abduction of the queen s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration				190.74099888268432
the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head				35.4522936559986

i do not understand you so much the better i have a ray of hope left listen i am all attention said eug√©nie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze				620.5027715401042
be easy my dear edmond we are near the conclusion				4619.962295128765
he was standing near the officer and he directed the point of the poniard in such a manner close to la ramee s heart that there could be no doubt in the mind of that individual as to his determination				15685.723532004298
pardieu monsieur said athos that s a proposition that pleases me not that i can accept it but a league off it savors of the gentleman				187.40795370119253
villefort walked to and fro behind them				17.106495191638313
at all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother in law with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy				1076.4422855014277
then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in france				46.50004221151578
and now eat and drink i will entertain you tonight				696.3717599188932

i accept it interposed d artagnan proudly				329.1098175852342
marie michon was a very aristocratic person like her sister the queen she had been accustomed to pleasing perfumes and fine linen she resolved therefore to seek hospitality of the priest athos paused				157.18771966298956
i think some one is coming mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to blaisois to follow his example				979.0958868990197
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon				97.7993731111961
bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions				995.8972453372652
this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is as dant√®s spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of ren√©e who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him				39.14641343454781
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would i give up five years of my pay which i am never paid by the way to make the king five years older really				108267.52175145537
edward begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it however at length he decided leaped out of the window into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies and ran to his mother his forehead streaming with perspiration				633.6136479832007
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her				15.569177218324686
i i detest i loathe it very fine anne				1397.3441018767344
if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything ah maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both i will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and unjust				1494.2270352623364
the two things agree marvelously well i am all attention said d artagnan				1.005780100639942
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him				1.8367841759980206
in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation felton started and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan				653.1692728056577
so much the better it proves that we know how to keep our secrets i do not reproach you monsieur said d artagnan tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked aramis haughtily				20.417944886787932

if you do not go sir said de guiche remember that we have two steeds able to catch your mule and the power of having you seized wherever you may be and then i swear your trial will be summary one can always find a tree and a cord the monk s eye again flashed but that was all he merely repeated his phrase i will go and he went				1192.7357283564252
if anyone comes call me i will lieutenant said the soldier				142.44633061642236
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care				2821.7921808130786
come gentlemen let us all propose some place				749.2937440354235
while he was speaking albert had heard the report of two or three pistol shots				4396.143892059169
and she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined				12965.249262445566

athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice				9717.118857689426

aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol				544.0531766402921
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment				151.8333107689342
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each other we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m de morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m d √©pinay dear valentine that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eug√©nie as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed ah how good you are to say so valentine				546.266929688813
what do they say that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing what nonsense said franz reseating himself				7.7730862471299975

they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them				8.051741357771105
50117m these last consisted of all the young people whom valentine s death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth				401.1816549239723
you are laughing at me i understand				41.74466565315052

i am not going there to be imprisoned said dant√®s it is only used for political prisoners				2166.962663592578

the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him				2.4146134823482877
alas said d artagnan with the most sentimental air he could assume can you be cruel enough to put such a question to me to me who from the moment i saw you have only breathed and sighed through you and for you milady smiled with a strange smile				23.673041701861795
but this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made was perfectly just				1660.9300564418916
oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france				53.04401424911239

ah m de villefort cried he i am delighted to see you				3.8242048198075023
you think of everything said d artagnan and i thank you for planchet my dear athos raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed				1224.8933458367596
but said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of kitty i must not play the fool				4706.215165914779
d artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use				11852.66660546791
dant√®s listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer				4572.6005575190675
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix				60788.37718063149
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more				230.6001532065028
i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth				2980.614020456518
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him				4.362277172712949
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tr√©ville to a young b√©arnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our service then said tr√©ville it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de tr√©ville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance i defy your eminence to prove it cried tr√©ville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my h√¥tel with the duc de la tr√©mouille and the comte de ch√¢lus who happened to be there the king looked at the cardinal				252.99109295065568
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove everyone listened eagerly monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak				127.42992486602877
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort				23.926881478117124
this gentleman asks me for information which common politeness will not permit me to refuse politeness you simpleton retorted la carconte				19.160133595577374
madame de villefort fell at her husband s feet				252.15803141633705
you believed that you would fly from me by returning to paris you believed that i would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch				7238.096751306076
i have resolved to fly with you not a word be ready				467.41689360978097
the two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the louvre				610.5251663528172
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp				2205.9921640628536
but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger that is well understood and in that case how shall i know where you are you do not want your lackey is he a sure man to the proof give him to me				7.271730131299493

we will arrange the matter rather better				1054.319109832863
now monsieur de chavigny is not amiable i allow but monsieur du tremblay is considerably worse indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness				15205.082022002844
d artagnan entered after the cardinal and behind d artagnan the door was guarded				2538.606855714302
where shall we pass the night he inquired				371.4249980768678
it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan that is true said the king but never mind tr√©ville come still by the back staircase tr√©ville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him				4.3701100372285895
at length an honorable peer morcerf s acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived				1907.4064117246305
taste the hashish guest of mine taste the hashish franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth				223.2943056904372
what is the use of boring one s self with so many things				1935.7621002310345
ah my dear fellow said albert rising and lighting his third cigar really i thought you had more courage so saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage				180.9734670316417
i am monsieur du poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of vincennes mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that d artagnan and porthos should give place				1362.2580300632778
the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest go sir replied the tutor but in heaven s name do not expose yourself to danger do not fear				425.64190915169183
what is the prisoner doing inquired vampa of the sentinel				152.6048740547371
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it not at all ah that gives me more confidence this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascon s soul				596.6215753538457
my sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter				2511.5113543683847
yes continued athos four times only once at the house of monsieur cr√©quy another time at my own house in the country in my ch√¢teau at when i had a ch√¢teau a third time at monsieur de tr√©ville s where it surprised us all and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman				56.28187907326786
there monsieur there is that letter cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice take it and deliver me from your odious presence the chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and retired				629.4723419902313
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says				1317.3717803086238
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze				4885.6921261576035
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf s apartments				610.7758730684419
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour at ten o clock and the queen at what time is it her wish to start at midnight then it is possible				160.51727441810633
adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat i leave you bearing a remembrance of you a remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for i am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn				4520.237641995443
porthos said d artagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me oh				75.3716407955148
when i am rich i will order a statue of chance from klagmann or marochetti yes said morrel smiling it was the 5th of september the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my power i endeavor to celebrate it by some 20237m heroic action interrupted ch√¢teau renaud				2607.3280434390435
the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with him albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked				18127.809672644904
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself				51.20738502698113
ah you are his son he said that is a different thing sir i surrender said louvieres presenting his unloaded musket to the officer				6015.059972297913
you see you were deceived murmured the magistrate come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her each time you have applied to me said the doctor it has been too late still i will go				297.863617727153
raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm				1008.1157179310752
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan				302.73265637567897
hold sire said d artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute				14099.572616419602
there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic why so said danglars why dramatic can we account for instinct said monte cristo				1.0035047530433352
estafania give up the keys of my drawers and my desks for form s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day				764.4370283457362
an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you can not grudge it to me debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie				120244.08245941556
that s well monsieur de tr√©ville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent to me				4.62559331766171
there is still something else said he				7.516682556920932
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second				171.2486294933227
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england				60.291877170069036
trial it was a stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till midnight				1527.8078694844457
no i did not say i was a stranger to you				8.422239997929285
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on				302.6586117382388
in politics my dear fellow you know as well as i do there are no men but ideas no feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all				182.01587946991884
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away that was true ah				245.5636674577808
that name written in her hand you see then said athos there is a god in heaven still chapter lxiv				1081.6781937493772
i tell you so by the faith of de tr√©ville how so you will be assassinated and i shall die in the performance of my duty but your mission will not be accomplished that is true replied d artagnan				1.0060803891456978
d artagnan answered with the greatest simplicity i came to paris with exactly such intentions				1518.3831128995862
ah i have been running very fast mademoiselle but i must do m morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass				779.729442535655
throw myself in the water and strangle him oh gentlemen cried athos be men				1513.6755975507986
you have sent for me sir said athos to m de tr√©ville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders				200.41701225719433
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am that gentleman i say what has become of him deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful				22289.656452024843
who was it you were talking with over there she asked				57.77398465302891
what are you doing here he asked in a lofty tone as that of one accustomed to command				1384.8048610694193
the valet de chambre appeared on the door steps				371.449794198198
this movement revealed the spot where winter s body had fallen				1257.5983075894503
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abb√© on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died				1059.486814119961
an opportunity presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory to be acquired and money to be gained and as a far higher encouragement it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he adored				1106.6907380224295
the young man was already dressed and was reading a new book by m chapelain				12034.382873923116
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eug√©nie and the arrest of benedetto villefort having retired as well as noirtier and d avrigny her thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard				180.1266580451322
be it so said athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people				559.8261159795697
she is gone said he she must have returned to the louvre you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out no replied bonacieux with a self sufficient air she is too superficial a woman is the young guardsman at home i do not think he is as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters all the same it is well to be certain how so by knocking at his door				19.848329365058408
as queen catherine used to say continued she excited by her own words rather than give up this infamous broussel to them i will strangle him with my own hands and she sprang toward gondy whom assuredly at that moment she hated more than broussel with outstretched arms				1047.7607564383252
this was a great matter in the way of honor but very little in the way of wealth so that when the illustrious companion of the great henry died the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was his sword and his motto				36690.24900364931
i want recommendations and some information relative to africa				40182.64910038847
i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider				3121.2267953764394
i recognize you perfectly the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion				15209.795478685332
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m noirtier i know it is very bitter said valentine so bitter that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter				8581.389385083772
if he demands my daughter let him fix the day declare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or quarrel				1392.8750228470524
with the queen i double her risk after the queen her departure would double mine then the court once safe i might be forgotten				230.57222538247802
as for my wife i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france				59.703933575037894
for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions				699.8046867351884
having wished you all to witness the challenge he now wishes you to be present at the combat exactly so said the young men you have probably guessed right but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said ch√¢teau renaud				1.1694028473693685
why did he kill himself instead of you				23.060272987731842
you incline me to think so said the king				30.19418265901065
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of collicure wine these were the lackeys of these gentlemen				2113.479111077253
our b√©arnais was a prudent lad however young he might be				727.6126893980397
you may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to us no pardieu though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow horse				103.52152558195276
is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon if i were sole owner we d shake hands on it now my dear dant√®s and call it settled but i have a partner and you know the italian proverb chi ha compagno ha padrone he who has a partner has a master but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes				33604.643910893
she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter				242.80022804460302
i must speak to him about it as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement				2655.9323729456523
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle				1450.830588304197
at two o clock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the h√¥tel of monsieur de tr√©ville				5.946939574271746
come come tr√©ville hold your tongue said the king				20.7016193257053
now said she listen to me the request was needless				3513.4788596963385
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea				162.99040744258522
i won t hold my tongue replied caderousse i say i want to know why they should put dant√®s in prison i like dant√®s dant√®s your health and he swallowed another glass of wine				203.4540494012255
he remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity				10542.542922675559
at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop				348.6645345693785
not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted everything depends on you explain yourself pray monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba				96.44336050764213
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed				720.0745605953978
then c√¶sar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man				3.0334900634857607
he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man uttered a third cry and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet				28.72804767996422
and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time when the door opened and eug√©nie appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her hair dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera				1465.7425656610105
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault ch√¢teau renaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees				448.88584295212445
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough i have never seen him put to the test replied raoul but he is a breton which promises something yes yes resumed de guiche i am sure he can fire a musket when required				1426.692312110991
now attach him to our party				1048.7909613883396
at one moment bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light which illumined the sea for the space of a league they might each be seen each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which even in their hearts of bronze they could not help experiencing				256975.39267886136
i will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me and if he keep his word and interest himself for me in six months i shall be an officer or dead				598.0451587447686
come here fellow bazin who was crossing the ante chamber majestically in his clerical dress turned around to see who the impertinent gentleman was who thus addressed him but seeing his friends he went up to them quickly and expressed delight at seeing them				19.09798467657836
upon this promise d artagnan withdrew and the next day he began service				5393.423188036747
this is all very strange said m de tr√©ville after meditating a minute you mentioned my name then aloud yes sir i certainly committed that imprudence but why should i have done otherwise				1580.4436419466083
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world				36.38278440800222
i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity				774.4554735998588
the fact is said d artagnan if men are punished for imprudence and triviality this poor king deserves punishment				6975.801848390138
alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father s love				1004.1864048818213
my misgivings had been but too true				112.93983892174904
but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy				1355.5120606949918
wait till he is set out and then marry come up ask and find out				222.21227477151888
dant√®s turned and perceived that they had got out to sea				1730.9780581496784
and as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin				3752.701595672432
what i mean to say is this sir that during the last fortnight unforeseen circumstances have occurred excuse me said morcerf but is it a play we are acting a play yes for it is like one pray let us come more to the point and endeavor thoroughly to understand each other that is quite my desire you have seen m de monte cristo have you not i see him very often said danglars drawing himself up he is a particular friend of mine well in one of your late conversations with him you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage did you not i did say so well here i am proving at once that i am really neither the one nor the other by entreating you to keep your promise on that score danglars did not answer				82.68365135747379
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes				157.50065949682192
she slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first hope				2316.4216750394685
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baron s right hand with his left and held out his other hand				44.081420893124914
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge				2835.341856722362
yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise i can not answer as to what i may do myself be prudent in any event said the countess				52.237656971947324
so you like it you rogue so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought what is that that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly do not let that disturb you i have enough for two no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse good caderousse so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me true remorse and besides an idea had struck me andrea shuddered he always did so at caderousse s ideas				1074.6657246100701
oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellency there has been such a drought come thought danglars it is the same old story and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration				2632.7505024986594
i m no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own				177.17101284060988
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened				752.7129370693195
it is singular said d artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i can not yet remember a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor				6597.134574782134
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m bazin				557.0370952128732
no the sound of a bell announcing a visitor will but accelerate the resolution of one in maximilian s situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder noise monte cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow the glass was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw morrel who had been writing at his desk bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window				215.88160019873175
morrel is in his room is he not mademoiselle julie said the cashier				45527.392209603
here is what you are looking for he said				31.22342288584428
i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard monseigneur said m de tr√©ville that will be unjust to the guardsmen				20593.890811175035
i am sure he answers my purpose knows no impossibility and so i keep him then continued ch√¢teau renaud since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champs √©lys√©es you only want a mistress albert smiled				24.663305792044888
it must have been the devil who taught it you was it not mordaunt replied by trying his opponent s weapon with an amount of strength which the gascon was astonished to find in a form apparently so feeble but thanks to a parry no less clever than that which mordaunt had just achieved he succeeded in meeting his sword which slid along his own without touching his chest				4769.64410462768
that is the reason which has induced you to leave via reggio where you have lived since the death of your wife				170.60011017798706
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands				30.82879494057619
and you asked porthos haven t you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligent what then is his name planchet yes i have found him again but he is lackey no longer what is he then with his sixteen hundred francs you remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying a letter to lord de winter he has set up a little shop in the rue des lombards and is now a confectioner ah he is a confectioner in the rue des lombards				335.62653240138707
monseigneur said marshal de grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son count de guiche and his traveling companion viscount de bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him what eagerly replied the prince will i permit				322.95146860491377
for added he the future can not fail to mend i inevitably look for better times				3373.177631779507
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart oh				257.28863677781686
signor pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast				2342.815156044792
the prophecy which the wounded man had just uttered recurred to grimaud who turned away his head				29.260216927559572
cromwell had sent him to mazarin				1390.767200902598
i will tell it cried milady with a feigned exultation on the day when i shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith the look of felton revealed to milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word				339.58603028876075
how was he going to find athos				351.42712806891916
de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother then said athos woe to de winter for the child had done no harm may the devil take me if the child be not dead said porthos				7.167169406045586
d artagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will execute well said d artagnan i decide that we should adopt athos s plan and that we set off in half an hour agreed shouted the three musketeers in chorus				419.99975000806734
on the honor of a gentleman but i can not be imprisoned for the reason alleged it is impossible what reason asked d artagnan				1.0065044165743293

have you the money he demands yes all but eight hundred piastres the count went to his secr√©taire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz				50.738589934306134
just now before i came down to you i drank a glass of sugared water i left half because it seemed so bitter noirtier turned pale and made a sign that he wished to speak				179.36102479220543
at one end was the receipted bill for the 287 000 francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel nut with these words on a small slip of parchment julie s dowry				21022.491340476357
aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishop s place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at whitehall				310.7226337874648
wait a moment sir said he i have an order for each of you also he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter				343226.94540341053
franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction				1000.4946983822713
there listen and at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode				5523.778822562369
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain clear				2121.0550785454166
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him				2.286750757964132
madame said albert allow me to present to you m maximilian morrel captain of spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest officers i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner				606.8697742293222
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet d artagnan				1.0124095678572715
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties				9007.441524272288
the three valets passed without accident				2565.223949493364
the only time i have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at windsor				246204.4436476237
then he must be playing in the garden go and see 50193m no sir madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago he went into her room and has not been downstairs since a cold perspiration burst out on villefort s brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch				3974.377477764737
is it possible that god has abandoned his representative on earth and left him to die thus miserably				10113.315106006728
alas no sir replied andrea with a sigh still more remarkable than the former ones				972.1349838120698
will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation ah it is really a serious matter then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on villefort s brow				152.65844046222173
the carriage had started madame de chevreuse had made a parting gesture to the young man and raoul had returned in a state of stupefaction				1595.8642335647687
the camp had entered saint omer the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen				23258.883072965775
did i not see you the other day smile on the duke of orleans				791.5719410348405
but then he may have stopped at saint germain i don t think so we appointed to meet at la chevrette i was there this very day and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis smiling				37.044730391754705
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos				46.67358029969323
behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with wax lights				3039.6651483685982
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him				2.5829663562477796
athos on quitting aramis went to madame de chevreuse				111.0991440956423
in his whole person he bore such an impress of high degree that madame de chevreuse half rose from her seat when she saw him and made him a sign to sit down near her				6.040472871411487
i will go myself and fetch the lemonade d avrigny bounded towards the door flew down the back staircase and almost knocked down madame de villefort in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen				1021.6004915013865
i sometimes dream that s all				335.4270228382442
you are the representative of justice here and it is for justice to avenge those she has been unable to protect who was your brother asked he				10.621677066901535
this letter was in milady s handwriting only this time it was addressed to m d artagnan and not to m de wardes				27.48891113657375
in an instant his sword glittered in his hand and he sprang upon his adversary whom thanks to his great youthfulness he hoped to intimidate				8264.30571769789
it is nearly eight o clock and at nine i expect a visit				370.7062766166796
but how is it he is not already returned				775.5408356566476
when you had betrayed your friend god began not to strike but to warn you				8.996917417556991
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you				4.339878161694269
when to morrow evening if you like at what hour at ten in the evening if that suits you by that time we shall have returned good there continued athos either peace or war will be decided honor at all events will be maintained alas murmured d artagnan our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever d artagnan said athos gravely i assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that				89.21530696080181
you cry very loud you end by doing nothing you talk of flying mazarin shrugged his shoulders and taking the queen s hand led her to the window				70.0758006273543
from the ends of these two wings extended the park				429.53557340036684
what ails our friend said aramis he resembles one of dante s damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels				33616.21518941526
oh good lord monsieur chevalier said she what are you doing i said d artagnan nothing and he read you have not answered my first note				3721.839890400394
the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a light to it				40.23998582901476
he remarked that a light was burning in one of the highest windows of the tower				7054.147638578291
you remember what a beautiful night it was				320.9321544564487
he had assigned himself the task of saving a man s life that day chance caused that man to be myself				1071.600074228924
in five minutes they gained the land				3015.4494618128133
wait what are you going to do asked aramis				34.78485798059147
i will give it to none but the king monsieur said anne				1069.8294643857823
this is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for i stand here to accuse you sire said lord leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false reports my own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and scotland and i can almost say that with my own ears i have heard the clauses of the treaty debated the scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows				429.2524027651451
and to be free a prisoner has to pierce a wall detach bars cut through a floor all undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish but before which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way				3736.969806081138
but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious				8525.528979833081
you arrive in good time dear d artagnan said aramis and by taking part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence				11485.544552076217
defend yourself one minute said the young man				1.1185665173238315
that you inherit from your mother truly from my mother leonora corsinari how much may it amount to indeed sir said andrea i assure you i have never given the subject a thought but i suppose it must have been at least two millions danglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost treasure or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid ground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up				306.12829189428714
he seemed scarcely five and thirty				15922.332803830184
the first idea that occurred to milady s mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant				485.73130171214535
she had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut				362.09763696738116
if i take you you will be hung the young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horse s head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud				6745.7987734346225
athos filled a beaker with champagne and gave it to him				5.322869659048856
madame said he i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity				5418.592639712958
hold your tongue stupid fellow said d artagnan and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest injury				2398.350543833822
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening				804.4807119691125
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home				227.5513195649973
d artagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth				929.162672777852
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me bravo cried ch√¢teau renaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism				6191.29069654649
he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present				604.5868348659216
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at d artagnan				1.0190534588774796
speak to the governor then and where is the governor in the country anger mounted to d artagnan s face he frowned and his cheeks were colored				1824.4427287280128
luigi vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied alexander king of macedon				4031.916840866506
well penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head why i says i still think you ve got too much on i think you re right answered he we shall have a gale a gale				3470.370500465147
panting with loss of breath he returned to the room he had just left				487.2911785241868
i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp				43.26582539084638
now by way of having a resting place during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookery which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name				2186.0807094960255
that admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king charles i whom heaven protect from evil came into france i would offer him my house my own house but alas				454.1776003604139
you must have received a false report or you have gone mad alas sire it is but too true louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance				3641.5885684798286
the cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than ever				147.96163401931358
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids				24420.611606531424
i may have been mistaken at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew				4100.682455518722
why then have you laid it aside because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners sir replied d artagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks				619.9033150053166
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest				1096.5275345967934
luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind				103.31761104622304
a cup of chocolate i did not ask for it				12.525970591153822
at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazel nut la carconte s eyes sparkled with cupidity and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said monte cristo did you credit it yes your excellency				13095.00568132049
and have those who have lost their lives lost nothing m				378.5295264034508
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale				432.2293607967444
courted by my step mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed idolized by edward who notwithstanding his fear of the count s large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful present m				616.3254772020792
madame de saint m√©ran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former				16054.928184527873
you seem incredulous said monte cristo who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french				627.0678954749978
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world				81.76837946281847
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos				8.4002127777175
those fellows strike hard and don t leave off in a hurry				5007.652564022414
a black point floated on the sea				96.19887797016054
speak speak said valentine i entreat you has your resolution changed valentine it can not change unhappy man you know it must not cried the young girl				16.68568812446661
i have given the signal for what for the barricades				948.9899211901557
france will not perhaps be always ungrateful				7066.7457642969
that name sounds strange to you said athos smiling it was my nom de guerre when monsieur d artagnan two other gallant friends and myself performed some feats of arms at the siege of la rochelle under the deceased cardinal and monsieur de bassompierre				11445.764879439603
but how have you become acquainted with all these details asked the president				109.23343167852225
a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord				1748.1224871405352
ah you speak spanish enough i think to fulfill your highness s wishes on this occasion meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place				163.14638811590012
as they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio				1136.3989610328433
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors				12576.577164956108
the swiss became as purple as a peony				57031.813187110856
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle				12843.48900761846
the procurator s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud all surrounded by duchesses and marchionesses who cast bags of money at his feet				39.39448949718344
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket yes said d artagnan athos is right it must be burned				4299.290187813245
andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position				412.5020252955466
daughter of a prince i restore to you the riches and name of your father hayd√©e became pale and lifting her transparent hands to heaven exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears then you leave me my lord hayd√©e hayd√©e you are young and beautiful forget even my name and be happy it is well said hayd√©e your order shall be executed my lord i will forget even your name and be happy and she stepped back to retire				18724.09312053407
d artagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her feet				46.87573132789773
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil				55478.76676671694
the comte de la fere is not a man what is he then the comte de la fere is a demi god has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say perhaps he would accept perhaps yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept he must be indeed a strange man				87.3070244944018
7 dr guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an execution in italy				1066.926154854541
vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything				159.74378774386443
who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death				121.82749951828778
tomorrow morning d artagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him				1.8078138956486278
amid all this d artagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos				298.82616110543137
what sort of a man is he ask the vicomte de morcerf you hear m de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess				61.99774934481352
since lord de winter left him i am distracted sirs				20806.760114342298
ah what else is there said danglars for at present i can not say that i have seen anything extraordinary				2240.4537023780163
you shall take him with you there				246.11368700448784
danglars alone was content and joyous he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the pharaon secure				1394.0098950872905
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river that s well said d artagnan				1.0038813352269422
my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread then whispering to selim she asked what were her master s orders				384.0494543968434
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him				5.078713872969634
why this evening said the abbess today even				12490.576026474388
is he still in a fit said the procureur				316.12836147860423
but m de tr√©ville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queen s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful				16117.427236148962
why don t we go in with them asked porthos				8.422934800985658
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush				2961.6269269725613
some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with torches				3081.755322129701
now then said d artagnan this is something like this is a means of communication				7635.285002281131
as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his shoulder				3746.8118480040107
they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them by chance that is why i have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa				334.2327722648258
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket				4671.644517343292
comminges saw that he was undecided				49408.159661405414
to day i am engaged in a different affair				205.2469691563573
it was a tolerably fine winter s day and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison				337.59468134935963
mine you have heard and that is to pursue you on earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of god you persist then i swear it before the god who hears me				4.164047032972812
monsieur d artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity				1122.0300399676764
i am brave when i set about it				5.871791137040453
now he continued withdraw a little and let me say my prayer i beseech you				3.24220545954013
here you are home again raoul said the comte				43047.77738440937
bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already full				5386.504385526654
i once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss				71475.88795217313
the plan of changing their clothes was unanimously adopted				19266.593488963692
it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible possessed that ever existed				7113.5025380756415
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover				4093.243209255627
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword				122.95249923508247
what s that the lightning answered the captain our felucca so far so good laughed athos				12.347595544855585
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre				343.4369567954005
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace yes said d artagnan till she comes out ah my faith said athos you require too much d artagnan				1.0462088584392877
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry true said andrea				77.5402145752767
not another step he said or you are a dead man what then said vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other who are you inquired the sentinel				728.7018946626938
i am a great captain that i am				130.08429444741165
why does he go in secret				245.30409052065139
the siege of la rochelle is about to be resumed monseigneur				767.0941894598107
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english nation ah said d artagnan a singular commission who is this monsieur oliver cromwell inquired porthos				22.31504971240705
commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work but asked danglars in a timid tone how did you manage about the other formalities the contract the settlement the contract answered dant√®s laughingly it didn t take long to fix that				89.85014222155611
bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue				237.7684412408202
oh you are young while i am beginning to get old				7439.432347785461

excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m debray lives some distance from here debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do				285.2293546023085
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinal s directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman				8906.4589117999

vainglorious as he was porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold but had at least half				3534.2743816666016

they don t have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four yes but monsieur groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is monsieur mordaunt this time the musketeers did more than shudder they almost cried out				547.5716686662871

we must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant manner				56.51730373789513
in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable				4735.578406708073
and pray upon what shall i make my campaign upon grimaud i have brought you another said d artagnan				1.0083055493584758

at length d artagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a woman s torn glove				94175.03679592822
let him run on said danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says				675.5490839312617

you suit me very well baptistin bowed low				4189.176909624566
he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the sound of his own voice for he fell into a sort of ecstasy				77013.7689169446
not before me behind me but with what asked the duke				13.644780493939054
bonacieux rising all in a tremble supported herself upon her chair to avoid falling				80802.00057418572
i had acted hastily towards him				4.64351193515922
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe				10482.750160917169
your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table				44.559448405138674

our partnership began in the month of april				15752.147424463681
are you also the victim of a treachery no said the novice but of my devotion of a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still and who has abandoned you is that it i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me				12.178146650803154
marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on mericourt				20830.72425145796

ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room				23.181773312582134
then he rested he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be going				852.0741141671429
the whole but how my god by a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which i likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinal s police and what did you understand by what we said a thousand things				1348.170636097328
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that				1038.1397217013985
come you are no longer twenty years old to my great regret mordieu				66862.43445178811
is it really for us that you mean your attack here he is				40.20907637243785
what say you franz oh i agree with you the windows in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me the truth was that the mention of two places in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffled up individual proved as franz felt sure he would the same as the person he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom				7506.244283720313
what do you mean i only mean that the count seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the same question				117.46987829703002
they proposed a game of bouillotte				18743.888786317966
julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen				12781.636488892835
she will save us said conti				105387.28399192168
i will go down then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dant√®s saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks				1588.8960932293764
just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon				46.32251058515075
a recollection of athos came into her mind				55.89786530642639
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed				609.5503985848617
porthos abated no doubt of his too great confidence by his adventure of chantilly played with skill and prudence				2513.602004522817
i present my letter from the queen to the superior and i bring back the dear treasure i go to seek not into lorraine not into belgium but to paris where she will be much better concealed particularly while the cardinal is at la rochelle				25.383337398420217
stuff and nonsense we have seen plenty of dead men in our time hearing these words the two shadows blockaded the road and by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their arms				645.724020732015
d avrigny cried villefort i can not tell you all i feel at this moment terror grief madness yes said m d avrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act				359.17682346777434
as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that lord wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck				1020.8768622125633
it was six o clock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp				8032.736678971388
these 900 000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased				464.03293050778217
sleep well your last night as citizen i am to be a soldier then said the young man				1.1079621315641544
then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a croak answered this signal				1500.4859081144846
dant√®s is a good fellow i like dant√®s				943.1119476242528
no madame the law has commanded and when it commands it strikes				12116.514993849712
that s a great story to tell me porthos				281.1564419274506
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived athos and became thoughtful she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan				12147.557317197223
the officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets				1359.1514114809975
monsieur bazin said friquet monsieur maillard you know who he is he gives holy water at saint eustache well go on well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head				496.3811380743828
you are setting up an establishment of course why yes replied the count				9.481691296309748
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name				2136.8774488142203
the ch√¢teau d if cried he what are we going there for the gendarme smiled				39.22645294919466
everything said olivain to athos has been done according to your directions the horses are waiting and i was asleep cried raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details				24218.64806786848
bonacieux he will rouse the whole quarter bonacieux called a long time but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer s house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac				2675.2459228969446
well baron i promise you some good exercise said the gascon				42.922373430757
the others my lord the second i heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the comte de la fere				3.783489129828778
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do				2170.81197756134
the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table				34.23359310602753
and where is auteuil asked the count				11.793531832379848
the man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street				75.77058462304788
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke				4969.071275207731
it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteur s carriage said d artagnan upon my honor i begin to think that heaven favors us he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman s little finger				191.61267138453917
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert yes you are right watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger				571.9823985535036
gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings d artagnan started off for saint germain followed by porthos				356.5115420315759
this child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor s orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden				581.3107087308675
the four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark				42306.68643087849
besides one must lay out one s inheritance somehow ah porthos cried one of his companions don t try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity				5614.715993959224
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke				13.131684087513976
your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not he said turning to d artagnan				1.0099484917210768
what is it the child conceals it but where did he find it in his mother s laboratory does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory how can i tell				388.8860615602867
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged				30038.29503506923
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step				287.9853203274016
be more economical but when i have no more money left to pay you asked the infuriated danglars				774.1198625047925
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands				62.77398099792907
oh i can not behold this frightful spectacle said he				5.848912440482727
danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved				1616.45376988985
here is monsieur comminges said d artagnan returning to the cardinal				17.949440366109606
the cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for albert				1689.3020460611558
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind				61.608040456697225
monte cristo in taking the seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there				548.3178854600288
making no reply grimaud opened the poor man s jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and grimaud becoming pallid				13951.943012275437
explain it athos groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself d artagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers				8951.402527558728
any why not this evening this evening monsieur i am detained in paris by indispensable business ah young man young man some flirtation or other				713.10026866808
silence whispered the duke she has her reasons she will ruin us returned the prince				103.40499602368389
then all is agreed said she				48.79693080427666
there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce you with your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received				259.5881499289078
it is true i fought with tolerable success i don t speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others d artagnan pretended astonishment				80.66063668299435
but make haste i can not stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dant√®s ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it				14.76447600728
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation				1479.1578601193853
the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m de morcerf and is justified by his son				268.45986792566464
oh m d avrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m noirtier just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking and the same love for you eh my dear child yes said valentine he was very fond of me who does not love you valentine smiled sadly				124.15908919888244
it is not true said milady in a tone of voice so firm and with a countenance so unchanged that if d artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have doubted				9348.106394771077
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened				299.5573226588291
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks				408.7212527379665
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope you re preparing a pretty trial why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume i should think not indeed				131.57250735568599
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day				50.77279974453425
oh cried madame de villefort it is really frightful madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard				338.8301867279708
traitors screamed lord winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the plain				2357.069499407281
let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my weakness then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile				1968.5799987876517
morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say here i am maximilian come and help me he had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the clover field a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone without a servant without lights at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions				3640.6544810271434
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind				170.66251586704988
arrived at the staircase it was still worse				5196.57306606604
from that time d artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of mme				41.63827766148122
observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites				42951.69627872101
unhappily those times are past nonsense				14688.372002603084
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg‚Ñ¢ license as specified in paragraph 1 e 1				2145.987819997204
in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years for change of air will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty				1172.7438798654002
ah this letter gives me an idea a capital idea				1579.657817706286
she extended her hands to him with a smile				299.55375167855243
a fine prize friend mordaunt we have both myself and monsieur du vallon taken two knights of the garter nothing less but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen i imagine i faith i don t know				48.54860681048435
that horse was to have identified us in the day of battle				87.33891984387475
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground				83.101918411322
the tie is even more direct it seems to me oh madame said villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the marchioness				7031.881656798046
at six o clock villefort retired to his study at eight m d avrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then m noirtier was carried away				133.7955265960718
the queen is too virtuous and besides loves your majesty too well woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal but if the queen be guilty let her tremble indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it				4.783730653873117
the man was one of those puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around cromwell				4922.766827387272
now i travel a great deal particularly on this road and i wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune it seems to me said the host that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur bah i have passed perhaps ten times through chantilly and out of the ten times i have stopped three or four times at your house at least				486.6048105196312
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it				7.603065935595992
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated				1062.745319989719
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it				14.446340800135028
dant√®s reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions				13221.243280654173
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six o clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening				56.95595727596337
yes replied the man but at what a price listen friend said monte cristo				1.0055482388450174
let us go you mean no my friend said athos you must leave us leave you cried d artagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement				13756.547507494912
ah ah said he what does this mean this is the gentleman i am going to fight with said athos pointing to d artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture				175.15233654096906

besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything				149.66678765673382

see here it is the woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice suppose it s false caderousse started and turned pale				84.39351888702919
m bonacieux lived on very quietly wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife and caring very little about it				10.182891316479246
the king s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of athos s heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom				484.792317885634
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping				7641.57158832425
it was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise				6442.76356775382
but what s that to us				124.41309558782609

milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his watch				3274.101100909914
villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary				63494.29446474325
they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate				26985.76863725842
what is he going to do thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his father s intentions were				403.9308061185306
the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream				1151.0539775385364
take them and if you need money for your expedition sell them fearlessly my lord				22.638651946710016
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side				1484.0290271075405
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch				2332.4465197210056
in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow				854.2290087186108
the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom valentine s i am coming was the customary signal of farewell				7371.74562717059
i must confess to you count said danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me				9.394870070257754
yes you are right let us go porthos but let us go well armed were we not to keep the rendezvous they would declare we were afraid				1570.9173928110888

fear that relentless pursuer clogged dant√®s efforts				4321.570385087114
the duke exchanged a signal with them				28.57199395631109
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place				258.51446964186295
oh sir said she clasping her hands				19.786693577868498
what do you say that my orders go far madame and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty what horror cried the queen				16.291316697524287
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz				46.16675237322735
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at any rate it is a french word				1139.5277244705312
well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature and he withdrew sighing				17111.860909700026
is it your decision athos resumed the gascon				93.78215727831446
dant√®s strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak				1579.6367271398287
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise d artagnan s vigilance				2573.437363711092
i see you are spoiled dear friend you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal s guards have so many proofs ah				550.6395692289464
edmond it is not madame de morcerf who is come to you it is merc√©d√®s merc√©d√®s is dead madame said monte cristo i know no one now of that name merc√©d√®s lives sir and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your voice edmond by the simple sound of your voice and from that moment she has followed your steps watched you feared you and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes m de morcerf fernand do you mean replied monte cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling names let us remember them all monte cristo had pronounced the name of fernand with such an expression of hatred that merc√©d√®s felt a thrill of horror run through every vein				875.8732141961714

an officer who saw me with a jealous eye reading the lives of the saints to the mistress of the house entered suddenly and without being announced				744.4961008959133
fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome teresa				22240.776344561615
now to apply it in your case to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable to no one by heaven				183.52691559945154
there came to the court an ambassador so brave so magnificent so elegant that every woman lost her heart to him and the queen had even the indiscretion to give him certain ornaments so rare that they could never be replaced by any like them				378.0001384039657
you are right a mute from the east				1924.2363555573584
the door was wide open a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yard a strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment				69.1221431129177
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse				113.87677680981878
bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive				3436.5730034200296
at the next inn you will find a wounded man now being attended by our servants who has asked the assistance of a minister of god i will go said the monk				171.92289461357558
the cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears as would have been the case with a father a brother or a lover				3488.5911975645085
thank you said luigi drawing back his hand i render a service i do not sell it well replied the traveller who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer if you refuse wages you will perhaps accept a gift ah yes that is another thing then said the traveller take these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings and then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you will not find one better carved between albano and civita castellana i accept it answered the traveller but then the obligation will be on my side for this poniard is worth more than two sequins for a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre what is your name inquired the traveller				4877.30317142449
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him				2.0478305419386684
but how can i pay them oh nothing easier you have an account open with messrs thomson french via dei banchi rome give me a draft for 4 998 louis on these gentlemen and our banker shall take it danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and paper peppino offered him wrote the draft and signed it				4742.723903607555
i don t very well know what but still something monseigneur said d artagnan this was what happened to me never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it				5.2008660958347415
the executioner then took off his red cloak spread it upon the ground laid the body in it threw in the head tied all up by the four corners lifted it on his back and entered the boat again				588.3091521748344
bonacieux so much happiness is not in store for me then you comprehend it would be only a question of time a sort of race which should arrive first				952.8858939538155

the request was granted and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up				762.5722761080642
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set				8063.199274684923
then said albert you became the property of this man 40080m no replied hayd√©e he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople				23498.066584957
only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of d artagnan and looking at him earnestly you have not spoken of this lady said he				7.0335359131346955
yes read it 50281m morrel opened the letter and read my dear maximilian there is a felucca for you at anchor				3908.3560464537563
he is reduced almost to the last extremity nay he is almost at the point of dishonor how yes continued caderousse so it is after five and twenty years of labor after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of marseilles m morrel is utterly ruined he has lost five ships in two years has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses and his only hope now is in that very pharaon which poor dant√®s commanded and which is expected from the indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo				591.3387703147703
he entered the hotel and ascended the front steps and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery asked if the duchess de chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the comte de la fere				3.574095575276992
no i want to live i shall struggle to the very last i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived				12495.282129730133
he then repaired to d artagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own				158.2772466338142
do you wish to speak to us asked morrel				20.0304030582072
mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside				184.33845734126191
yes replied albert raising his voice				63.41719086045899
the reputation of being out of his mind though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the abb√© unusual privileges				2752.409032908596
quite certain said milady with a last doubt				513.2750312480576
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation				1900.1903038660469
you will be a brave and adventurous captain d artagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp				6953.710212556893
because she had been branded continued d artagnan				1.0127357248203395
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning				1431.6323390537336
acknowledge that if albert is brave he can not be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise doubtless doubtless said morrel but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday you will breakfast with me will you not morrel said the count to turn the conversation				286.0239297001966
this is the fourth which you have let fall and i have picked up for in three years madame i have only seen you four times the first which i have described to you the second at the mansion of madame de chevreuse the third in the gardens of amiens duke said the queen blushing never speak of that evening oh let us speak of it on the contrary let us speak of it				5.133770687339296
i have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father				298.63143880820076
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week and d artagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling				478.27712997883975

all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf				39506.590836051706
all this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so good natured who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year				749.268019517848

on seeing him d artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise				97.70190922982066
it is not their fault that they are bandits but that of the authorities how so because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a corsican s nature to revenge himself what do you mean by having made a stiff having assassinated a man said franz continuing his investigation				2514.5010994114464

edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm				1805.5292950023818
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts				684.8498384020572

athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also				1342.1451348237822
i know this because the landlord came into my apartment when he left his				299.6759033747514

but instead of going to her own room valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden				240.86640393537272
it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned				10995.324020009182

dant√®s went on looking from time to time behind and around about him				4.725916944753906
adieu then and be of good courage said athos				7.59873841095794
no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good it is so good that i have distanced m de ch√¢teau renaud one of the best riders in france and m debray who both mount the minister s arabians and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour then they follow you asked monte cristo				1.0040649176102356
monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts				809.1855375249243
this immediately recalled to d artagnan s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme				24.91562482183789
there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage				1474.8757404372484
i never go there why what in the world cried aramis is that animal bazin doing				237.73511078979234

i will show you the way back myself said the captain that is the least honor that i can render to your excellency and taking the lighted torch from the hands of the herdsman he preceded his guests not as a servant who performs an act of civility but like a king who precedes ambassadors				82981.66905514103
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily				1088.947216342328
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room				6.090125922225339
take care of the executioner d artagnan all right				237.63650723083555
faith no for between the culprit and the victim i have no choice but i cried morrel groaning with sorrow i love her you love whom cried monte cristo starting to his feet and seizing the two hands which morrel was raising towards heaven				138.43057000046244
at the noise made by d artagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world				206.45311830552484
the chamber cuts down their salaries every day so that now they have scarcely any				679.7361266170795
i propose to defend no one but myself and i shall defend myself vigorously i give you warning very well said the voice go away from here and leave the place to us go away from here said d artagnan whose purposes were in conflict with that order that is not so easy since i am on the point of falling and my horse too through fatigue unless indeed you are disposed to offer me a supper and a bed in the neighborhood rascal eh				2077.948347240978
ah maximilian i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my grandfather s look at that moment would more than compensate for all dear valentine you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what i sabring right and left among the bedouins can have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels				8545.773726006315
let us follow him said de guiche it will be the surest plan i was about to propose so doing answered de bragelonne				51.008731418618304
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort				49.66027162636052
yes returned the count i know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon				996.692988436512
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless and how was m de saint m√©ran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count				8.568531145650462
now m de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten months				666.4693372910145
the count felt his heart beat more rapidly				5578.720379579535
monsieur de beaufort told the guards who took him to vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of escaping my lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long ago come come not such a fool as i fancied thought mazarin				47.84586851411564
now one evening when d artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them				1685.1771790105183
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop				182.47123785622944
i have served them without enthusiasm god knows that i estimated them at their real value and that they are not high in my esteem but on principle				26648.492506485934

you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond said to bear the name repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager				10829.596793941873
at whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that i shall be ready to give you absolution thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice				3.6071207219124384
one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and pastrini s account of vampa s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them				36.32315392537928
look at monsieur mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced d artagnan had he dared meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself				1187.4066250081848
as for porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them				23.269241861411352
what cried aramis and athos what				314.76678777659674
yes indeed cried d artagnan who was afraid of disheartening his friend by telling him that the cardinal had not breathed a word about him yes surely he said he said resumed porthos				38.574105712854575
what i can not tell something wonderful an absurdity a miracle of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope				409.8721569538438
besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second				312.29848928077644
others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied thereto thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly concealed a woman s letter monseigneur ah yes i see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know i have taken orders monseigneur said athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a woman s letter but it is neither signed marion de lorme nor madame d aiguillon the cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his eyes				87.56000864070391
in addition to the sword thrust in his arm which is not dangerous he has received another right through his lungs of which the doctor says bad things but has the wounded man retained his senses perfectly does he talk with difficulty but he can speak well monsieur let us go to him				19.67693947024526
and how said harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you in a very simple manner colonel said d artagnan				1.0057642460840093
in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them				14.523937897934667
this count of monte cristo is a strange man said emmanuel				607.7428765393396

aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate				27738.89392959924
meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape only for him it passed more slowly				1986.2082468465283
in the first place you will sup with me will you not asked aramis				32.339033470307136
i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but i could find nothing				89.84585793505417

he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for d artagnan and grimaud obeyed as usual				1454.4643662525875

i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain				176.2786064926281
while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars				7.934642340826293
ah maternal love is a great virtue a powerful motive so powerful that it excuses a multitude of things even if after duncan s death lady macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience madame de villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him				5.685691235664464
then when they had disappeared he said with a smile tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a water fowl ere it takes to the wing set sail				780.3342302202924

is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words oh my god no said lord de winter with apparent good nature				2302.6459103079696
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart				34.01839757898515
i have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention i believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince yes i understand it well				71.04959421808518
it will require four or five days for the transmission of the money four or five days for her to return that makes ten days				477.8724941962178

instantly a mask wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance				5461.71619655966
she moved with the light free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian				5661.451704298175
you have lived three years in paris				37.94716152666798
the 28th of february 1815 at half past two in the afternoon today is the 30th of july 1816 why it is but seventeen months only seventeen months replied dant√®s				192.59648116078642

at length after winding about for a minute or two mme				2514.1522124181824
as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from time to time as i require it one thing still puzzles me observed dant√®s and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight i worked at night also replied faria				925.7211746086705
franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so				15.186129100076682
ah monsieur said the young man i meet you then at last				80.38108051226777
d artagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate				119.43018920203485
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately				223.1332670799063

i had only to cry out help for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then i should have been free why didn t you do it asked the lieutenant				31.96582362184833
the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he can not make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a m√©salliance				31746.193478404562
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet				4765.183929295116
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted				13922.329586074562
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of franz				181.03768180765974
these names are too numerous for me to remember them all and i will content myself with the first said the queen graciously				949.0396989979095
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them it was past midnight the next thing was to find planchet				562.3635640966934
and now my lord that i see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband well then madame said de winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him alas				491.478508798496
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint				2442.1064971426536
the jailer continued now this was his project				2831.666810418184
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head				130.53945148851213
courage he whispered to porthos as they proceeded				1520.3537290140448
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man				11.39387470984919
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations certainly and that is why m and madame de saint m√©ran have died that is why m noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to die it is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his edward				1487.1303118169437
in the whole house said friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is noon good said comminges				238.71611430441226
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him				2.489977428064026
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired				513.789505738158
there were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from athos porthos and d artagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them				25.386442192075783
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them				15.946835471317032
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair				339.2783460839159
albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it				5.867648764352882
i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me				17.743757837768143
i am not a priest you are not a priest cried the executioner				105.90438101332595
it was only to fight as an amateur				12253.075639603096
d avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man				1.0690357675711095
i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home yes yes				99.60534615310075
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars				1176.1286072207893
he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possible that the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him that then he would have 50 000 remaining which would be sufficient to save him from starvation and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him and as he prayed he wept				573.9588243411227
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given				780.788314962698
the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains				1010.4026277675185
during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also refreshed				12515.7832721351
d artagnan slipped into the wardrobe				12910.76189273095
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded				76048.90715435482
three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate				9605.138378819933
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof				3593.1576085973147
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty i encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty s service in whatever way you may see fit to use me the abb√© d herblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii of whom i have spoken to you madame then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service				562.0445491614682
the cardinal s guards and m de la tr√©mouille s people retreated into the h√¥tel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them				8.539955869672863
the ancona road replied the baron				381.08765096201813
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain				792.6589904965346
however i had better find him out first since he can t want money				607.7651911167281
the men i have put to flight will return reinforced if they find us here we are lost				345.9216786272668
wait my dear father said the young man one word more say on however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing what is that the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house oh the admirable police have found that out have they				1576.855994605985
you are right athos said aramis and it is a rather difficult matter				835.2059147585286
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act				5566.534301127042
oh my god my god have pity on me without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m bonacieux lamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomed the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting				1560.9691429988354
you can see it in his eye				537.900432514245
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities				19140.064444019114
besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life thus dant√®s who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth				4105.522865181184
now i repeat my father is named m de villefort and i am ready to prove it there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult				7833.521637078337
monsieur d arminges was already mounted				748.6069881621752
well what is it asked louis xviii				22.110738057465422
the inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote nothing to be done this visit had infused new vigor into dant√®s he had till then forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date 30th july 1816 and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again				340.9762608489809
the more so sir as it was men s and not god s doing tell me of those men said the abb√© and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything				232.82905347232085
he touched him on the shoulder				348.66702842138466
we should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed athos and yet it will not be the less said we were four men yes but to yield said porthos				6.199410385071791
i hate the english they are coarse like every nation that swills beer would it be better to remain here said athos and take a turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort				143.50968592688977
how should he have been otherwise				491.4759308978868
besides my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes continued la ramee and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort yes but monsieur de chavigny is sometimes absent when he is absent i am there but when you leave him for instance oh				264.5596712032272
a lover is never terrible he said				36.707666162149756
then assisted by bicarat the only one left standing they bore jussac cahusac and one of aramis s adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the convent				2005.154761120289
what could she have done to you				6.700399033303151
at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham				2576.428341820483
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose suddenly				2470.582246902357
is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself				356.04673090719393
d artagnan seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard				846.7100245924873
everything said he to raoul shall be done as you desire but you will not stop to have your wound dressed oh my wound mine tis nothing replied the viscount it will be time to think about it when we next halt only have the goodness should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant to tell him in fact that you have seen me but that i have continued my journey and intend to dine at mazingarbe and to stop at cambrin				30615.123014592584
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians d artagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans				2495.733877585722
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawing rooms come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying				478.4666856477619
merc√©d√®s although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed				427.20310660344245
now am i at liberty to retire said the general				2204.4022659321295
each was anxious to gain admission before the other				41.13076344566128
good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her				11.78118888299885

why buy what one can take take said blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor				1430.3897629504547
i confess this staggers me and it has staggered everybody				11131.099284499918
the ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass				9167.12279920745
climb up said he to dant√®s				341.9753749445944
but please to observe i won back the equipage cried athos				5.815311491238848
is it not tempting what i offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only to do thus				273.91393455567834
how few to day exist plague on t my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me no i only brought you here to ask you returned mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers monsieur d artagnan				1.3098044496700108
good evening comrade said d artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner				2922.8605889302626
danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty				1733.041122460245
though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country brutal politics i must confess said maximilian but don t attach any serious importance dear to what your father said				32.24586648333842
i faith yes said athos for i am hungry look out for the black fowls cried aramis				13.507318754017811
how delightful to see you again dear friend he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass you ve not then forgotten me forget you				2.7570876909783437
in addition to this after a half hour s conversation d artagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head				242.77336945864792
but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature				5086.230274306666
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped				2938.5933756484715
the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances but porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurator s wife was obliged to give place to the king				27.317357251212908
i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky it is not like this then said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain				1276.8362497284927
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection				3370.6758018069363
marseilles resounded with their well earned praises				7102.703887105328
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived beppo has taken in plenty of others and beppo led him outside the walls said the count				8.426604552619336
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell				266.003240627094
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count				30735.123085433424
he fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month and he set his mind actively to work				374.01945814287404
ah good morning my dear count said he				5.129872547650999
milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole h√¥tel				223.16848767443568

the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no				425.31891645271133
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too				181.83778281573814
then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest				1244.1968479182342
the rest concerns myself don t be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis				11.587126144379306
i asked said athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure why how extraordinary said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment i understand english then				254.35079805127137
on his part aramis wrote a long letter				418.7990395939131
thus you see though born in paris i was brought up in corsica there was a moment s silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness				8610.261368148304
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather no no no replied the eye of the paralytic				377.69924988664417
you know the vessel is lost the pharaon sir they signal the pharaon				416.65876210304964
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that d artagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois				1234.088313246254
but you my dear athos you who so generously distributed the englishman s pistoles which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do i am satisfied with having killed that fellow my boy seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an englishman but if i had pocketed his pistoles they would have weighed me down like a remorse go to my dear athos you have truly inconceivable ideas let it pass				938.3257193010775
it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange				1577.6140955423152
answer me on what i could get you lie repeated the abb√© a third time with a still more imperative tone				320.13767716562865
what do you mean by that				76.7245978237813
however amidst all the prisoner s efforts to elude a systematic examination raoul had recognized his natural accent				1399.6687747289523
oh sir said danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him three letters of unlimited credit				1329.356203547811
the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary				480.9012947898067
i shall follow the count s directions not under present circumstances monsieur perhaps you mean to disobey me yes monsieur i must you persist then yes i am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out				14.875429812128713
we shall go out all the same do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked what then why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at and what have master pastrycooks to do with us we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us				299.2804837782989
it neither increased nor decreased my income albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject				114.78152605793431
mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to m de saint m√©ran and m de saint m√©ran is dead				107.52392642148516
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes				8.004124796462085
but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper				412.97791122689256
do you love me still ah madame said porthos in the most melancholy tone he could assume when we are about to enter upon a campaign a campaign in which my presentiments tell me i shall be killed oh don t talk of such things cried the procurator s wife bursting into tears				545.9104484281447
athos said a word to one of the vergers who bowed and proceeded toward the basement				20735.962410330674
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to d artagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him				3.970901526071618
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied dant√®s succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them				11.123441809380646
all we have hitherto done in the matter has been child s play				2802.135417057193
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her good murmured milady the austere puritan lies as to the soldier he only smiled				1986.247078239847
gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings				39592.58653562538
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest				640.5581323333948
seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count				31.29570815436016
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron s pension that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers				88390.74534609346
steel is for gentlemen and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter s skull and crushed it				12.890980142088747
the idiot how so if he loved her asked d artagnan				1.005584478374597
answer sir exclaimed he you have been asked politely and every question is worth an answer i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me it was with difficulty that de guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monk s bones				29030.46609046639
and of what malady it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face the smallpox				19068.972082340413
provided charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must thank and yet without the man the king would have been rescued cromwell smiled				135.06053629643347
we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while i sleep monsieur du vallon watches ah				123.28484251425613
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression				660.6134221509327
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared				288.6460471462552
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke				287.39023273737047
he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men				517.0807159689679
whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered				682.1779101842294
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme				1381.1211858367333
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bed head but his mother				243.747034414259
could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coiners say yes monsieur you are right said the host				44.33914722727294
wasn t i right to part with the horses madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt				1417.2228097087793
for pity for mercy s sake do not deliver me up it is too late they are coming said eug√©nie				205.83090401683052
the door was scarcely closed when albert bent his steps to his mother s room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the door				8.594336987648518
but tell me valentine how has it all been effected				4419.962832775684
felton named lord de winter the unknown would not name anybody and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make himself known				1213.9664443735626
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting				2797.5561262590104
well inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor 20147m why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franz s countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him				2394.531600634424
there you must rest young people are such braggarts it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds				4409.639225149492
you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali				3740.524656381656
oh oh said d artagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer				241.0635741443616
the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught				2524.1524009658497
you here rochefort he said in a low voice				5.927153702502841
the young girl looked at morrel				65.31564823749436
bravo monsieur grimaud said athos and now take this				379.02061587820737
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor				7385.009556552079
this lady was the daughter of nicholas de camus who arrived in paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself				36.05229323190108
is he at liberty asked the queen				13.922129091478263
my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriously thought of it yes returned the duke i must confess i sometimes think of it still by one of your forty methods your highness yes yes indeed my lord said la ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness willingly answered the duke give me the pie i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste				6432.940187278344
then you must not pay us we can scud like the pharaon under bare poles enough enough cried morrel almost overpowered leave me i pray you we shall meet again in a happier time				29.274347101464034
he then looked at the objects near him				3.7235414269154106
i was going to ask you if you had received any news of monsieur franz yes yesterday what did he tell you that he was leaving at the same time as his letter well now then the count the count will come of that you may be satisfied you know that he has another name besides monte cristo no i did not know it monte cristo is the name of an island and he has a family name i never heard it well then i am better informed than you his name is zaccone it is possible he is a maltese that is also possible				182.30408303919953
ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother				245.65033221932157
all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces no you did not answered caderousse you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner hold your tongue you fool what should you know about it why you were drunk where is fernand inquired caderousse				35.582200663512694
and you did cry he asked				21.695172850811403
she did well to die poor girl the sitting is adjourned gentlemen said the president fresh inquiries will be made and the case will be tried next session by another magistrate as for andrea who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some attention				1723.6295296667138
my good charles i particularly recommend to your care planchet the laquais of monsieur d artagnan				1.4456441624089924
the following day about three o clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count				50.27797028624963
but said debray to beauchamp if i spoke to the president you must have been with the procureur it was an impossibility for the last week m de villefort has secluded himself				48.228762799852625
and now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your mother and sister my father said the young man bending his knee bless me morrel took the head of his son between his two hands drew him forward and kissing his forehead several times said oh yes yes i bless you in my own name and in the name of three generations of irreproachable men who say through me the edifice which misfortune has destroyed providence may build up again on seeing me die such a death the most inexorable will have pity on you				27.914496641592383
isn t this fox a genius athos asked the gascon				42.46839802204075
besides the scriptures say confess yourselves to one another and i confess to you d artagnan and i give you absolution beforehand				4220.406661105574
if i wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him				11.460864455618344
the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal				2770.976940445003
the review over the guards set forward alone on their march the musketeers waiting for the king which allowed porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the rue aux ours				498.208449288975
have you seen him lately he sent for me to day really				6878.080234195005
farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full gallop				702.2532608072214
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt				2726.953061759655
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them is it possible exclaimed the count with well feigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness they do indeed				164.80909870469853
oh no monsieur replied monte cristo i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar				61826.73411401897
did you drink some too m noirtier yes and did you also discover a bitter taste yes oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again				367.84334200305835
and now when are we to go asked athos				9.224331057053194
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal				5060.548308618278
then in spite of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told gaetano to roast one of the two kids				14581.100731757166
you m de villefort send for the priest i will be the avenger what do you mean sir asked villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of morrel				1172.9642284600566
let us see said d artagnan				1.0083405974798223
the moon had now risen and he could see well enough to retrace his road				509.68689026720574
i invite you with good will thank you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and i must return to beaucaire my wife will be getting uneasy he drew out his watch and exclaimed morbleu nearly nine o clock why i shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight				1878.6247440527522
the abb√© busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future				518.3948394617813
gondy gazed on these deeds of darkness on these nocturnal laborers with a kind of fear he asked himself if after having called forth these foul creatures from their dens he should have the power of making them retire again				2122.643567735396
what this one too he exclaimed				694.3200262988601
20177m the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men s minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld				2812.175915888928
then i shall be free i shall have an independent fortune and and what demanded morrel				65.1463772584833
send me the keeper of the seals s√©guier and that man what has your eminence done with him what man asked the cardinal				14.6952991445205
i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self examination let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement				6285.527567846654
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education				11453.211693725054
i want a letter that will enable me to reach the king s presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious time but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him				6.292734799343558
you said let us die here i recall to you that word oh said porthos death is nothing it isn t death that can disquiet us since we don t know what it is				87.3190151129473
come come said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop				877.994930367518
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high				10624.864329591239
but continued morcerf √† propos of danglars we have strangely wandered from the subject				239.21155496909228
doctor doctor cried barrois who felt another fit coming				2906.568876577171
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent				1910.0995876074485
we are going according to all probability to la rochelle and once gone she will follow you to the end of the world athos if she recognizes you				11.133598434191148
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack				1884.0440619036685
oh of the most unfortunate kind monsieur				247.90078897583717
but what s going on in the city yonder said athos				5.448184638092319
on a hanging table which swung to and fro with the rolling of the vessel were a pot of beer and three glasses				2233.3339258411934
the queen who was scarcely less afraid of monsieur de beaufort than the cardinal himself and who was almost as superstitious as he was made him repeat word for word all la ramee s praises of his deputy				3851.110653337463
we depart from one place and arrive at another that is all				1044.647815684125
for my part i wash my hands of the affair so saying she once more climbed the staircase leading to her chamber her body convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her head in spite of the intense heat of the weather				596.3297586318685
he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces				422.25382453456416
20181m this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the count s box				376.33242084578336
how does this misfortune affect you				4.044818737514177
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction				236.80126855543085
she was poisoned on my account that s all you know of him asked mazarin				23.2226535904661
at the third he fell again				107.48301962482122
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms				408.54413295266676
in that case commanded comminges silence that old woman ah				100.30674841484709
you are included in the conscription fernand and are only at liberty on sufferance liable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms				550.219362428489
see if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the palace bernouin went out and soon returned with comminges who was on guard				1869.7977490307771
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate				4378.512193936915
upon gaining this advantage d artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman				859.6645077002
i had informed m morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last half hour to tell me that if his ship the pharaon did not come into port on the 15th he would be wholly unable to make this payment but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment it looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed m de boville despairingly				10898.152645369624
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way				355.09725181914723
edmond at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of m morrel who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the guests beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes				1326.402409825948
valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak				90.41332619786986
what do you say of this asked the queen				14.89337567765556
you were among them you were				413.64582352591196

gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men				821.654444952485
he had tried his strength to the utmost				4419.650918609553
as to my arms it is useless to trouble you about them i have them a horse for your lackey resumed the procurator s wife hesitatingly but that is doing things in lordly style my friend ah madame said porthos haughtily do you take me for a beggar no i only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an appearance as a horse and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty mule for mousqueton well agreed for a pretty mule said porthos you are right i have seen very great spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules				4901.989730458764

before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time				2179.1482683147124

madame de villefort had placed herself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her child it was difficult to read the expression of her face				73.36425729108582
an hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of returning animation				19378.743136891895

let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment your lordship does me much honor said the host and i thank you sincerely for your kind wish but don t mistake said d artagnan there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may think for it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well received				293.30818123081775
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation				253.47953466913467
since my misfortunes i have been subject to faintnesses which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver				20110.561357606977

i called to you but you did not answer me i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours				424.62466394768416
but this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by a still greater grief				1088.6362297101434
noirtier fixed his eyes on her				7.681142441293761
alas would i could weep like you and he drew away his friend as affectionate as a father as consoling as a priest noble as a man who has suffered much				1332.1526783207537

but villefort raising his head bowed down by grief looked up at her with so sad a smile that her complaints died upon her lips				19.646577058991138
his companions horror struck could neither move nor cry out				263.4371629927429
she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago				923.8748001508624

then i must wait asked the young man				1.1580172705132907
we have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides i don t prevent you from listening but i must be gone you must be gone said porthos and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we make you will not wait till he asks you will speak first and tell him that i am gone on the lookout because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe				3271.0425527866823
he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age				1869.8993929445421
motionless with her burning and fixed glances in her solitary apartment how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration accompany the sound of the surf which rises growls roars and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle				2309.1672892675138
then said the two women to emmanuel we are indeed ruined it was agreed in a brief council held among them that julie should write to her brother who was in garrison at n√Æmes to come to them as speedily as possible				414.8285945995687

la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud				825.6305709349897
aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript ps				5998.069826030485
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots				43493.86180469766
on rising he went to his window which opened on a terrace having the sea in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest				1432.933388604733
when the soldier saluted charles athos s heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket				113.1221197909164
eh monsieur eh friend said d artagnan a half pistole for that paper my faith monsieur with great pleasure				744.540477644061

it is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in france these things are done				225.86276877833038
i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere replied the cardinal bowing to athos				15.182288070617886
as for that m morrel said he again turning his quid as for that as for what the money well well we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present and that we will wait for the rest thanks my friends thanks cried morrel gratefully take it take it and if you can find another employer enter his service you are free to do so these last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman				20148.57150631593

then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited				1155.2230060693612

the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball				1622.1111903644826
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for god s sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us				107.93971902531787
d artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword				113.31042195583993
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him				1.7165862196352024
if that is really so how came you in the bastille how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i don t know myself but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high treason of high treason cried bonacieux terrified of high treason				559.709205886931

have you forgotten that m debray has just seen you at my house ah true fix it this way				202.36353260580697
villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment and remained gazing intently on the scene before him without uttering a word				40.168947767414224
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey				1880.344567319066
are we not eating a horse porthos				2085.1583102110403
athos who heard milady s voice came sharply up				431.20665283144376

stop said he i have an idea well that s something for i have not the shadow of one said athos coolly but as to d artagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to ours has driven him out of his senses				416.3936108692901

she spoke some words to lord de winter in english who thereupon requested d artagnan s permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his pardon				634.1404804013026

gentlemen said groslow i beg you will take your places				37244.621817353
his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble minds merc√©d√®s had always had a sincere regard for fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude				1169.5596075147914
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity				2110.271750831206

oh yes sir you are right it is fatality the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm				2466.3330890058896
evidently he did not understand his meaning				918.3840180585195
ah that would indeed be infamous how did danglars usually write in a handsome running hand and how was the anonymous letter written backhanded again the abb√© smiled				14.052346097398916
blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor				941.5132330855505
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly				1778.6317408501736
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment				77.97491234623337
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself				430.95135416606485
the abb√© told me it was worth 50 000 francs muttered caderousse				1181.204873291574
athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst d artagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully				42547.51343891736

milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat				1645.615050083002
a terrible inclination seized d artagnan to grasp the mercer by the throat and strangle him but as we have said he was a very prudent youth and he restrained himself				39.31570996498782
what mean you by that they have eyes cried milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not yes yes said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt				1653.5153841411493

look around you gentlemen if you doubt the fact said the duke				12.62606719796716
my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to life partly on my sister s account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance				1624.6122397227616
one moment my lord whispered athos and he said something in a low voice				6.949857668136385
now hastily interrupted the jesuit on seeing that his acolyte was going astray now your thesis would please the ladies it would have the success of one of monsieur patru s pleadings please god cried aramis transported				392.1208232803659
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer				1102.9661012155818
but the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees				168.23718412539188
my dear athos i wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest for a fortnight				928.5935159814284
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding light without warmth				5936.1331144314345
raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking				1841.107686556087
why the thing has made a tremendous noise yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no one can be more ignorant than i am of the affairs in the bourse 30251m then you do not speculate i how could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income				7068.794830988712

the king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of monsieur and the queen				36.42659879556763
my father is proud sir and if he had not a meal left i doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone except from heaven well then after this first visit has been made we shall count on you i must again excuse myself m morrel for after this first visit has been paid i have another which i am most anxious to pay true dant√®s i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father the lovely merc√©d√®s dant√®s blushed				123.20955962600485
as long as your brother was with me he kept me up but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father				118.86460782074037
here he said here is a draft at sight and here is your fowl danglars sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had cost				4799.416825484708
he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock				4303.269146877533
athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings				2595.6055647152343
have you a good horse monsieur de bragelonne my horse was killed this morning my lord and i am mounted provisionally on my lackey s choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best				2459.575433895568

they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady				92.168349505012
how are you to get away from here				701.8602446566597
the second operation was as successful as the first la jeune am√©lie was in luck				5337.414523448279
nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer				3281.979077373943
non inutile desiderium oblatione go to the devil with your latin				15638.524021736914
perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march if they are penitent said athos let them follow us well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemy s army at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle				230.82556872932483
for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind				227.12930171642208
this note was in a different hand from the rest which showed that it had been added since his confinement				18951.294031692796

look attentively then at this gentleman the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel				104.54341223007148
we do what we can and she rushed out of the room				27.352276019049974
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs				276.40987621155955
at last he heard the voice of la ramee				86.4428192890644
ma foi he said i prefer waiting till tomorrow				100.09685120872507
what i think of is that we have crossed swords as enemies				2459.5379040391695
sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore i determined to show him to you myself				213.8142262388848

bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight				852.6809369400761
did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty				331.9044878898967
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated				724.5158061725449
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain and the count de guiche follow urban and planchet and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest				4864.296740062146
on what was d artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling				5624.566398578553
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver general				442.35976919705365
valentine with her woman s instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristo s second and from the young man s well known courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him				7.398113199507342
the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters				683.248295269307
has not some sage said nothing too much				185.37390918600067
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed				238.0332100652834
the return d artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation				62332.09275921098
the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses french and rochellais				3205.87262162873

the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her				9.201800889808364
from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the f√™te exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight				2530.7218112464843
it must have been charming indeed				201.6867931790884
i was reflecting in the first place replied dant√®s upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained				13934.988669665216
and aramis said the duchess quickly				103.09969277378826
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky				4418.378199810289
make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield				19876.569511119716

in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine s mind				114.16689416226224
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable				22094.25145800047
shall we return to the camp said porthos				11.218223974894848

it must be it shall be seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death				688.356261724806
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which merc√©d√®s had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium				2794.1645419495553
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort				1.9942705638105362
really said athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so				19.743481216714315
ah it is jacopo she said the captain of the yacht and she beckoned him towards them				14.128443310440643
i don t see what is to keep me here a glance was exchanged between athos and aramis				18.557408920110113
planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway while grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable undertaking that by five o clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready				883.0505224382351
at your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly				3125.805236287502
yes he appears to be a resolute fellow well he will do more than he has promised he will do wonders then the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs				65.88856567620064
you are gentlemen and i am a poor innkeeper				1073.979273604218
because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands and that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what i see it has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the future then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister we have not thought about it yet madame answered d artagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly i ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants alas madame exclaimed d artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us perhaps said anne but that idea if at last i have it your majesty will do us justice				836.1136376050205
his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him				3.1113278034665606
what undertaking can have brought him to paris				159.7271831602209
the duke walked so fast that d artagnan had some trouble in keeping up with him				4.582041656175512
well said he they likewise have refused me that dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than yourself he took a quill wrote the name of d artagnan in the commission and returned it to him				7.635923254755732
there are several branches of the d artagnans at tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal to which do you belong i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry the father of his gracious majesty that is well				342.40842757250704
ah madame said comminges hastening to d artagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector				2783.9334619364654
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him				3.608860500638518
but you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear not but cried the young officer speak then speak confide my shame to you cried milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another confide my shame to you a man and i a woman				372.86733523517165
0065m as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event				1642.0062981641784
you are placed on high my lord but tremble				655.1584465607508
tell me i entreat you my dear doctor that you may be deceived doubtless i may but but 30345m but i do not think so have pity on me doctor				2104.1665878688573
remain sir he added to aramis who had moved to leave the room				17.14425891791952
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precaution s sake				1202.9591844877275
he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias				1929.4550888736883
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat hayd√©e with all the deference they would observe to a queen				223.46643563673123
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human				2379.4004988330275
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately				419.178839398335
no madame answered de winter but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies allies said the queen shaking her head				9.963398688980833
then i went out of the house i proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready				671.8627720969212
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you				4.339690366330892
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london the devil				345.3082854990727
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice s steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins				3394.395286075256
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared				181.95001631076724
i had been told but would not credit it that the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of ali pasha it is true nevertheless then said morrel i understand it all and this scene was premeditated how so yes				651.9504406867709
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the king s name that they would stop as the king was hungry				1402.8720176765626
his father and mother were catholics i believe his hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of de winter and what name does he now bear mordaunt a puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in france do you say as a monk it was thus and by mere accident may god pardon me if i blaspheme that he heard the confession of the executioner of bethune then i understand it all				82.46701030825817
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman a gentleman exclaimed athos				5.77357026865103
a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there				115.77729246607463
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him				2.6483525034750466
most likely said d artagnan i am one of his most faithful servants it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england yes a certain d artagnan a b√©arnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to london do you know him personally asked the governor				51.723334463882786
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers				16826.575624998688
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt				863.0834623768602
the king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude				686.1678023418863
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest				1930.440698953195
from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts				5244.572627612627
i will take charge of the inside one				149.59786331369003
be content i will depart but you will not follow me you will not watch me i will return home instantly ah i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man said mme				31.296327463184234
see said she if everything does not second us				77.93283443174087
53 yes i am vice president father your coolness makes me shudder why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a hay cart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierre s bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things				642.0635892186236
he was nay probably may still be a bonapartist and is called noirtier i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de villefort				9.180509818515464
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly				6379.5741624769125
oh i see you prefer peregrination				13121.983335935061
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down				197.32893459302218
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility				845.5097413132331
after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down				497.5992320763948
might not this young man be sent by his eminence				179.53755174487472
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy why cried the queen how is that because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity				580.1429706471224
the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him				1.9286067022746198
he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united				1170.513087284998
here said milady rising with the majesty of a queen here felton behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl the victim of the brutality of a villain				8202.205773601461
the other drank it only by accident and although barrois is dead it was noirtier whose death was wished for but why did it not kill my father i told you one evening in the garden after madame de saint m√©ran s death because his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months i have given m noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection while the assassin is not ignorant for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison oh have pity have pity murmured villefort wringing his hands				26.123623831139625
was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment				176.1344250674344
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort and then my lord continued rochefort you understand that to emerge from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change one s prison say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said mazarin				22.013380785515434
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly				670.0669444691201
now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some day or other				620.8369086138704
it is well known how violent the king s prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men				800.140448918488
trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart				26.82299849103533
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter he opened a drawer and took out a purse				475.17444248265645
madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action				719.9245286473745
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament				9112.627626185838
it would be impossible to make use of a diligence equally so to engage post horses to travel either way a passport was necessary				1670.0900718617104
after shutting the gate behind them i pretended to return to the house but i immediately went out a back door and stealing along in the shade of the hedge i gained yonder clump of elder from which i could hear and see everything				144.49386323066145
but remorse is not thus banished like virgil s wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair				88.62424959100395
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone				246.85414239102877
my friend said aramis if you like to ascend i shall be delighted to receive you ah said d artagnan is that the way you return to your apartment after nine at night pardieu said aramis the rule of the convent is very severe pardon me my dear friend said d artagnan i think you said pardieu do you think so said aramis smiling it is possible				408.3846155127078
since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me				4.00713651994144
d aiguillon marion de lorme and several other gay women				515.809521340957
the one i have hired for you where will it take me where you please after you have put me on shore at portsmouth what are you going to do at portsmouth asked milady				39.84033254982308
this dinner consisted of meats nicely dressed choice wines and superb fruit				338.8345490602829
i can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment nay answered monte cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded				3507.4728171034562
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged				5281.604667098719
at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me i have great power more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs √©lys√©es				177.19627467637287
there was then amongst that crowd a moment s hesitation which looked like shame				437.7693698218031
go on as i entered n√Æmes i literally waded in blood at every step you encountered dead bodies and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned				1652.2527574204212
and you approve of what she said that is to say you declare that the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are accustomed to convey your thoughts yes it was you who sent for me yes to make your will yes and you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions the old man winked violently				106.96917027488219
my father said i was his joy you style me your love and both of you have called me my child do you remember your father hayd√©e the young greek smiled				88.1501049606607
i was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair it was i said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance and it was time for you were sinking yes returned dant√®s holding out his hand i thank you again i almost hesitated though replied the sailor you looked more like a brigand than an honest man with your beard six inches and your hair a foot long dant√®s recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the ch√¢teau d if				1.5802380967224148
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day				2654.1384233339736
but dant√®s was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody s professions of friendship				1422.667902176625
d artagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it				6.615844658653615
why did you not have him arrested while in paris arrest the duke				89.42216889365176
it seemed to him that heaven had at length taken pity on him and had sent this noise to warn him on the very brink of the abyss				2203.9471689008933
i have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two days and nights				4103.428696999529
i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me and as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door keeper				903.778976116995
he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders				7036.637907175146
his resolution not to sign lasted two days after which he offered a million for some food				999.9533669721598
but we must say farewell edmond and let us part before i leave you merc√©d√®s have you no request to make said the count				8.034187725942886
no count he replied i am the only victim in this case				783.2195462328368
to morrow the army of paris will be summoned the day after it will be here				1040.3905554102535
where is he ill very ill say you				13.179136056467131
empty your pockets said he i want a hundred pounds and as for my own and he emptied them inside out				468.7719691160893
my son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here				285.78180921212146
they are not dead for the death of d artagnan would make a sensation				194.05668936322132
felton remained behind he held a book in his hand				7.156094782816538
information about the mission of project gutenberg‚Ñ¢ project gutenberg‚Ñ¢ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete old middle aged and new computers				76.56017771006543
he was accompanied by another man who carried in his hand something long and flexible rolled up resembling a washing line				550.0782281424476
luigi vampa s bill of fare chapter 116				3319.390019347149
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned yes do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him no do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine yes then will she die too asked d avrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier				94.15621396363237
and why not because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the lady i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn said buckingham				419.4453641961929
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry				3093.380329163553
kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep sigh				351.37937286270204
as for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there conveniently ready				1761.788656599623
yes indeed the marks are recent quite so replied the lieutenant				31.34370730794834
you see i am generous am i not mother but you my poor child i				44.11077410635722
mesdemoiselles noblet julia and leroux executed the customary pirouettes robert duly challenged the prince of granada and the royal father of the princess isabella taking his daughter by the hand swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle				5114.666117698972
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also				371.6868577984146
three days afterward pistache was found dead poisoned				9992.16514698678
whom does this belong to he inquired				547.617102389273
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open d artagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid				824.4900482372504
let us be on our guard oh				203.54633106588105
i know him for a norman and normans are obstinate in fact tightly held as he was lubin endeavored still to cry out				108.60448113182709
if we were to see you fighting i can assure you that we would make no effort to prevent you				3.9701210183798987
pronounced the famous i have been almost obliged to wait bertuccio made but one bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse voice his excellency s horses monte cristo wrote two or three notes and as he sealed the last the steward appeared				12.722813382808315
have you not happy rogue that you are have you not your duchess who can not fail to come to your aid well you see my dear d artagnan with what ill luck i play replied porthos with the most careless air in the world				65.64737148549057
you will know that to morrow evening said the coadjutor smiling				12.810752566174981
that is to say athos will be chief engineer porthos purveyor in general and aramis governor of the fortress meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau				1035.4562079592642
the young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute				498.8676508210435
athos wished to restrain him but it was too late				138.76080945563842
i will now go up into my apartment				164.36928448005824
so much the better are we then to go to war by my troth yes against whom are you a politician friend not in the least are you for mazarin or for the princes i am for no one that is to say you are for us				50.99100313622825
he is the cause of all this misery i am quite sure of it whispered caderousse who had never taken his eyes off fernand to danglars				194.38898352557828
then i will go to the governor of algeria he has a royal heart and is essentially a soldier i will tell him my gloomy story				295.0582780997928
forward aramis wounded as he was seized the mane of his horse which carried him on with the others				2408.9248491880594
a man was introduced of simple mien who had the appearance of a tradesman				4333.001674122292
peste matters are going all right should you know those doors again yes do you know the numbers yes what are they no				1053.3542935839932
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majesty a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son				337.4413044640862
i don t know what it was				164.17416232635333
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight o clock had been watching his door				159.99169051079082
this time said d artagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot i think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach france				383.1042086244493
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation				875.1964669189675
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated dead dead 50090m chapter 103				2995.526185521802
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration				880.4899179292477
on the staircase he met athos and porthos who were coming to see him				2.428557914359837

monte cristo examined him with the same look that at rome he had bent upon the execution of andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward the abb√© busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in 1829 he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities				1309.170250525874

all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos favorably				3026.5703391239726

how many people thought he and not one true friend and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said respect to fallen majesty the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart				599.1726423311272
but said grimaud in the same silent dialect we shall leave our skins there athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven				89.92266332887006

but as i can not and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier s gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance				3407.349108338391
why much the same story but how could a poor catalan fisher boy without education or resources make a fortune				651.4050846959901
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tr√©port it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion 30279m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars				544.1743414983641
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head				158.3288782245342
my very self replied planchet but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud proud toward an old friend				92.4219776124967

thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind				1411.9332037085649
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy				976.1120125665173
the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance two soldiers said d artagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out fine looking men upon my word said d artagnan				73.99746939341591

remember we are waiting for our turns speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities interrupted aramis				111.99677727918716
this time d artagnan was only in part mistaken he himself was not in question but his horse was				154.90504982065207
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage				11808.270358706506
i recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea and if you come another fathom nearer i ll stave your wicked head in with this oar d artagnan				1.0345960862966317
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one merc√©d√®s desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan				1143.5394001600505
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose				853.8331775115034
still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain				958.6446627602418
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large				1684.8573944273783
that will do said he leave the rest to me will the petition go soon today countersigned by you the best thing i can do will be to certify the truth of the contents of your petition and sitting down villefort wrote the certificate at the bottom				4722.211292639456

no one can say that m noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed				255.64417232023285
lend me your back but don t let the cardinal go porthos lent him his back and d artagnan was soon on the summit of the wall where he seated himself				33.24801086526893
bonacieux with a half smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience				1266.6654601759244
felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall				38.85639886922312
having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him				4.941708914474047
he had retired at one o clock under the pretense of being indisposed				1057.3257432434657
porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied				3638.3220453914155
be assured gentlemen we shall do you honor in our dying				630.6344159739167
if you do not believe that it is my father say so immediately and if on the contrary you believe it to be him state your reasons for doing so beauchamp looked at albert with the smile which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind				137.94579378417075
it does not signify gentlemen continued the cardinal without appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the diversion which athos had started it does not signify gentlemen				1429.6942278597419
we know the count s vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man				1111.8044287052396
the next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability				4049.50814889305
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the people s good will				145.941351888804
i swear it before heaven and the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward				1947.4766710210044
well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal and wherefore were you called away just now asked mademoiselle de saint m√©ran with an air of deep interest				1156.425593385153
you received a second fortune money and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felon s life might live as other men				528.3954749084744
my father who was such a brave soldier whose career was so brilliant oh well he will add we are warranted in believing that this fernand is not the illustrious count of morcerf who also bears the same christian name i am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses do you yes you do wrong which means i suppose that you refuse the service which i asked of you you know my theory regarding duels i told you my opinion on that subject if you remember when we were at rome nevertheless my dear count i found you this morning engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain because my dear fellow you understand one must never be eccentric				11459.493930493672
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace				1415.9434516712304
a fortnight after i was at rogliano and i said to assunta console thyself sister israel is dead but he is avenged she demanded what i meant and when i had told her all giovanni said she you should have brought this child with you we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it benedetto and then in consequence of this good action god would have blessed us in reply i gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we became rich what letters were marked on the linen said monte cristo				1.0063335897661865
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans				1572.9501895981807
they were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note case containing his letter of credit for 5 050 000 francs				413.7491910894941
albert listened with the most profound attention				850.5952459403572
four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven francs are all that i have earned and i ought to take ten to the owner will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have with pleasure sir twenty francs are not to be despised				1086.5255325375733
they are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition a function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish i prefer my own specific undoubtedly and so should i prefer it after the effects i have seen produced but of course it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you but i said monte cristo rising as he spoke i am gallant enough to offer it you 30079m how kind you are only remember one thing a small dose is a remedy a large one is poison				11201.307391565135
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur d arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms				18000.568966520572
but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf s or jackal s				451.4798344087074
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable begin with his father if you please said the abb√© edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love the history is a sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it yes answered the abb√© edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles at la r√©serve				89.57208808828779
it was the abode of the little abb√© scarron				173.055297675474
my lord said d artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time				1107.6463077198098
albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress a jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat				359.1155144505094
there was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them				8.481191948002538
ja in the most german and the least gascon accent possible				600.5997352573605
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid				2585.4492722040536
they were waiting at the entrance of the rue sainte catharine and their horses were fastened to the rings of the arcade				6148.167679108411
why he remarked to gaetano you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of porto vecchio don t you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands true and he is going to land them added franz				31.06175192083191
all was over carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall				2876.6554670569785
no mother from this moment i have done with the past and accept nothing from it not even a name because you can understand that your son can not bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another albert my child said merc√©d√®s if i had a stronger heart that is the counsel i would have given you your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its dictates				3758.9375579498974
should you not have known me again in spite of my eight and forty years of age on the contrary i do not find you the same person at all i understand cried athos with a gentle blush				4745.782446846553
what do you fear everything replied athos				7.634931121660058
now then do you wish for anything else said the patron				373.81762452351217
and am i not a hundred times better thus cried eug√©nie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so oh you are beautiful always beautiful cried louise				1077.5890673170527
hayd√©e had remained until the close of the meeting				1899.7155765522948
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo				1.0032885073923568
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway				1514.7882643010219
come my friends a moment s delay said athos our servants here we are they cried				834.9980503630788
it does not concern me you are right and if i have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the french captain or the count of morcerf but on the fisherman fernand the husband of merc√©d√®s the catalane ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit for i am the only culprit edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude but exclaimed monte cristo why was i absent				344.0353780974214
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her				32.895322640026876
no country can say it saw my birth				547.1449324182437
i am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives				3446.682146973009
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them				14.268799959912963
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes				4485.150697521134
impossible said d artagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward				5904.284381478263
be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive me yes or no saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to puritans				2445.4135487472613
but it has not been so with me i see and always have seen during the last sixteen years				31.97432244101359
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused				524.7801995731911
behold for what end the wretched mazarin has made use of you				22.544629407942345
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh				490.8302414754732
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of god s mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my father s tomb by your father s tomb said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of death				141.41458836471472
here we are without occupation it seems to me you forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of charenton i hope to see monsieur de chatillon whom i ve hated for a long time there why have you hated him because he is the brother of coligny ah true				215.7669550801915
merc√©d√®s read albert while showing you that i have discovered your plans i hope also to convince you of my delicacy				2678.2607213848664
now said gondy there is a communion between us				5002.569057862225
the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected something something had occasioned the noise and something must follow				349.80842076381316
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abb√© is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies				5858.124575813595
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand				27.658660509804
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger				2167.880417908636
and morbleu why do you not go yourself				176.9567279207863
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves				520.0402695399388
indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration				543.3806448035006
0173m will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell let us visit them all said the inspector				3129.862026775328
as d artagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish his respiration was broken and short				1039.621889347276
after me it will all be over and people will hunt with gins snares and traps				3047.4149419265927
athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind him				1.5510441292310273
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them				13.558597594780162
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot				216.65482853121816
and what will he promise us said d artagnan				1.0055327414634039
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass				205.06403498494166
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word				31.884790716829027
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again dant√®s did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him				3.447915077278511
d artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere				6303.163652693788
good evening valentine said a well known voice				126.51201405930072
debray had told you ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now then you are wrong madame				122.62298139957701
hayd√©e said he did you read it oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour				104.8251456063829
bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman				160.30707859159403
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him				2.448989329218597
to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward				534.686494717516
no before a woman you would dare not fly i presume remember said milady seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword the least delay may ruin everything you are right cried the gentleman begone then on your part and i will depart as quickly on mine and bowing to the lady he sprang into his saddle while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his horses				197.24774837652538
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few words				363.56407819936106
during the day i had nothing to fear				221.45014960762254
no i spoke of the duchess de chevreuse did you see her after her return from brussels after the king s death yes she is still beautiful yes said aramis i saw her also at that time				85.32637521695534
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressing room which led by a side staircase down to the yard eug√©nie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle d armilly scarcely raised with both hands				2988.74906700645
the house is sold then demanded the concierge and this gentleman is coming to live here yes my friend returned the count and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master oh monsieur said the concierge i shall not have much cause to regret him for he came here but seldom it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at all what was the name of your old master said monte cristo				1.0046639442756358
unfortunately the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange colored hide and his unaccountable gait that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh the appearance of the aforesaid pony at meung which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before by the gate of beaugency produced an unfavorable feeling which extended to his rider				1543.5301736144543
a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard				329.94197864411876

but be assured my dear monsieur d artagnan that if i had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than myself oh i don t doubt that replied d artagnan but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms a certain embroidered handkerchief for instance to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that i wish to belong to the church and that i avoid all mundane opportunities				2340.9480401539977

d artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies				19939.165054366713
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model				2575.521841195867
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything there was a brief silence the abb√© rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat				417.7762344115534
he says to you jauntily gentlemen there is fighting going on in gascony or in flanders go and fight and you go there				146.35167508242108
i find england a charming country and i stay but on one condition only what is it that i am not forced to learn english well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears us i believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again so be it said d artagnan but i i confess i have a contrary conviction our good d artagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye but in the meantime saves the country added athos				4.412617201909134
it does replied the abb√© with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dant√®s which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors and why among us four inquired caderousse				32.423284728656384

he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future				1086.9888088741945
the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence				781.3410168726477
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work				1250.5432690709522
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile				553.0338421802671
and after this reasoning she slept easily				1846.1872364857425

the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room				22.33947803321819

then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned but this proved useless for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six months				1124.457397905078
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out to night for paris eh cried the young man turning pale				71.14811508760764

ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable				287.7566325539221
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely				3746.3044825305924
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns				1931.2877501245393

never never the devil said athos				4.991914767932715
my father s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson m de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared				4.779893738837064
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation and in noirtier s name gave that order				859.7489553637711

in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dant√®s before he had power to offer any resistance				151.68019012879614

now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking d artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made a sign to guitant to follow him				4.69769654313689

there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man				1.1909691174345918

monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest				319.2650796838813
d artagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority				18892.484381953967

peste you come to your conclusions quickly				282.6304583701543
raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little louise whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten				202.23079978972982
and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit				2109.2104177485376

i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet oh answered another voice which d artagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis				241.9275741596811
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions				987.5380567215212
she told d artagnan that lord de winter was her brother in law and not her brother				318.5041916034385
the two friends left alone remained silent face to face				4053.2984572258865
his words were brief and expressive conveying all that was meant and no more no embellishments no embroidery no arabesques				1714.7644806768856
grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word pointed true said la ramee				3.6991103904522786
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly				7620.0307972594055

madame du vallon was of doubtful gentility				4319.8479954676495
then offer him double that sum a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital is your excellency really in earnest inquired the steward				445.7380489649562
is it not so certainly but if you love me as much as you say replied d artagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account what have i to fear why that i may be dangerously wounded killed even impossible cried milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert swordsman you would not then prefer a method resumed d artagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless milady looked at her lover in silence				86.410509516524
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir yes and much more what more will you say i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you				7.181810697254943
what the devil makes him glower thus behind him when de winter perceived them in his turn he advanced toward them with surprising rapidity				1711.673231976979

a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him				6.034044535548766
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking				1872.8548295100184
and so as we have said the iron gate leading into the kitchen garden had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet				187.3656003896818
the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the catacombs of saint sebastian i know it said ch√¢teau renaud i narrowly escaped catching a fever there and i did more than that replied morcerf for i caught one				155.7765819008581

almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment				122.51427319348265
let no trace of emotion be visible on your countenance bear your grief as the cloud bears within it ruin and death a fatal secret known only when the storm bursts				8243.737111516379
yes there is the sky here is the sea				476.51565104040054
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach				669.4786602519374
what is the matter then he asked				14.418964112962398
and why if you knew me do you let me die because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal				5006.04819608599
three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps the second to go to the charge no faster than a walk the third to let the enemy fire first				1420.0659800635924
through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park				490.5885313915419
the prince assigned to every one his post				1208.4018792527843
perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of fate possibly and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action it is not for me to judge				1176.042243831083
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion				862.8554936421014
d artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without reply				875.132201044404

his next care on leaving the barber s who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor s suit a garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap				3317.858214266719
come porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business nothing good replied porthos				8.428260179929012
more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever faria still continuing to instruct dant√®s by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory				361.5867466971355

the evening of the betrothal chapter 10				1701.7868248825425
danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of m de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation albert turned				273.22126031637447
nevertheless he pressed d artagnan s hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered				3061.3005336807782
he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy and returned as late as possible in the evening				117.57013010269972
at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him				5.694036848503061
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience well asked danglars				15.646813205777768
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you that s well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door only tell him tr√©ville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he neglects me that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him				13.884903274403486
this timidity which might proceed from the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor for men who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of their hatred				296.66642411736626
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation				262.55067395931
was he the man that stabbed you yes said the executioner				119.53051807204119
d artagnan and planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred paces				270.46416643450516
the city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred flambeaux of white wax a piece of luxury unheard of at that period and twenty violins were ordered and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate upon condition said the report that they should be played all night				2305.7751019511593
gondy had not walked a hundred steps ere he perceived the strange change which had been made in the streets of paris				420.5558712402487
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same				95.46636575882525

felton lowered his head and reflected				828.9015217862569
indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault s stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect what a dire misfortune said emmanuel thinking of morcerf and danglars				72.04863418765888

large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companion s elbow directed his attention by his glances				1408.8006284854055
the only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself				60.39264170379992

it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory				529.9053482579155
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foot s pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles				228.78902551956494
how many men think you you could collect together to night two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by to morrow we shall have quite a powerful army				460.0316098385677
she looked at him in amazement				180.5308849203267
ah that said the prince i understand that language thoroughly and since he is italian i will myself continue the examination				578.7161914510247
these conditions being agreed to porthos took leave of mme				38.212046008010894
it is sacrilege to struggle against so many things my lord				8.093876962849093

but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent oh i take everything on myself				88.643775554617

gu√©men√© was reading aloud and everybody was listening to her with attention with the exception of the queen who had on the contrary desired this reading in order that she might be able while feigning to listen to pursue the thread of her own thoughts				230.249871110928
debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain				3490.3749146029822
oh said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me d artagnan bah				205.88224172962134
but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt				6023.056099055144

we were to have conveyed her to a h√¥tel in the place royale said the wounded man				1.11382019405557
at this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of raphael s picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object				730.8615005998804
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution				2073.662423223557
it would be no doubt parbleu if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower said athos				69.45359002373755
but after he had gone about two hundred steps d artagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle				1386.0124639874498

i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this much desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti				1002.1448221254587
all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m caderousse yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard caderousse at your service gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest				198.5014251914426
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him				1.5691708165703213
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him				1.5762596026665845

i am betrayed on all sides				136.86928890658962
planchet had no need to learn more				2433.8874351834356
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived but have you only two days of leave raoul on the contrary sir i have ten nor is it to the camp i wish to go where then said athos smiling if it be not a secret				103.59134827304437
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof				2338.2527305599087
we can find out his well that s all very sensible athos said d artagnan				1.0044951436887475

from madame de montbazon he cried				38.75646618763641
there were but three h√¥tels in this part of the street and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied the other belonging to aramis himself				159.6786741514454
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la f√®re all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said				269.6985411612393
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dant√®s pressing his hand to his throbbing brows				754.4298190535061

but said madame danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate but this is trampling on the weak sir the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us is not death in my house oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture				51.78457343069854
this announcement was received in silence				1162.0394652259592
now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellous that which we do not understand				135.01604192648233
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer madame cried mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last he has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle but in case he is beaten well madame in that case my advice i know that i am very bold to offer advice to your majesty my advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom				1216.3357295853782

villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him				2.613278028533477
when they reached the steps raoul saw three horses				72.5182858682989
it is an old man s caprice and is there no means of making him revoke his decision yes said madame de villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor the count who perceived that m and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird s water glass				251.11388537061856
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall until at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du p√©rier				137.23538861954097

hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of giving myself at present i shall appear to sell myself that is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympathies monseigneur well well said the cardinal i don t wish you any ill but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends				119.29802737917431
morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in law s gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance				124.02678034579733

there were two doors he bolted them both				662.4669872237848
albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments				672.9657462890531

when they entered d artagnan s chamber it was empty the landlord dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger had consistent with the character he had given himself judged it prudent to decamp				3805.416324116431
unable to have me for your wife you will content yourself with having me for your friend and sister and besides she added her eyes troubled and moistened with tears wait wait fernand you said just now that the sea was treacherous and he has been gone four months and during these four months there have been some terrible storms fernand made no reply nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed down the cheeks of merc√©d√®s although for each of these tears he would have shed his heart s blood but these tears flowed for another				70.33527753411619
d artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle				25.08121332893671
now we are alone dear aramis said d artagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchet s horse i faith answered aramis as you see from heaven from heaven replied d artagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which d artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same here then is a puzzle for the learned observed d artagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise some place it on mount ararat others between the rivers tigris and euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near				717.2710181560155
are you quite alone inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass				370.8459484790191

two months ago you were dying with hunger the appetite grows by what it feeds on said caderousse grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling				5761.530527990846
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between merc√©d√®s and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them				13.870140039360631
yes yes murmured d artagnan that s the place milady s own residence then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him as well as all who loved him and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court since she had discovered all				431.418488663534
another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements				516.9345246023971
the leghorn barber said nothing and went to work				182.2166530738232

france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence				511.42050298601833
supposing this person wearied at the inefficacy of the poison should as monte cristo intimated have recourse to steel what if the count should have no time to run to her rescue what if her last moments were approaching and she should never again see morrel				1014.8042536060145

of these 600 000 francs you took 50 000 crowns				1374.9667733477581
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff				2877.2343811051096
now sir you have but to say the word and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker				312.1577958118654
sir said he that man has been here what man said andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected				928.6280540793937

it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker				185.38858303264513
d artagnan was radiant with joy and pride				505.94913380286005

decidedly you are a brave fellow said athos pressing the young man s hand				7.759817209037973
you tell me of m franz d √©pinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife but tell me valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart				26.718138874145648
and has this man displayed a friendship for you albert she asked with a nervous shudder				554.6326314369355
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble				953.7705110673913
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard d artagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal				2248.052782964499
the gascons are the scots of france d artagnan bowed to the duke and was retiring				1936.016876946351
we are leaving paris and when our journey is paid we shall have 5 000 francs left the blood mounted to the temples of debray who held a million in his pocket book and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women one of whom justly dishonored had left it poor with 1 500 000 francs under her cloak while the other unjustly stricken but sublime in her misfortune was yet rich with a few deniers				1221.0072498707564
who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be what do you think aramis why they are our men you are not mistaken i recognize monsieur de flamarens and i monsieur de chatillon as to the cavalier in the brown cloak it is the cardinal in person how the devil do they venture so near the hotel de bouillon athos smiled but did not reply				166.85959176307978

some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right that he intended to be civil in his way and that they would set the example of liberty of conscience and the mob retired				976.6846796556407
but not being able to stifle her she smiled upon her				8.591800638563333

yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate in four days said morrel it is extraordinary indeed said ch√¢teau renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too				1552.4838750417073

that is forbidden it seems to me where forbidden asked mousqueton				44.065690485370396
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course				241.58761643079646
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate				5129.007188435724
as d artagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith				281.5409372901721

monsieur said mademoiselle d aubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voiture s friends				112.87813919838949
the next morning he saw albert pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle				10547.893088861632
who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamp light a shadow approaching his chief				411.6682866250534
she was very plainly dressed as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in the morning				93.62541479862008
in a few minutes laporte came into the room				10.877249981983343
i learned it since i have been in prison and that from the conversation of monsieur the commissary an amiable man the cardinal repressed another smile				88.6745524705263
she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head the devil				100.0877829388853
that of a lieutenant of musketeers d artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket here my friend write your name upon it and become my chief porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to d artagnan to the great astonishment of the young man				1.1041489809345582

madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles				315.1572702836289
bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom				57.030067270169354

mazarin looked at her and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts he read her thoughts in her countenance as one sees in a transparent lake clouds pass reflections like thoughts of the heavens				1301.6322346260476
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but self love but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs				9347.393218058896
there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose				240.8426303200101
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dant√®s where he was				36.81136353154317

monsieur d artagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns				2395.0934329445554
caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing				507.76880977283474
then are your names gentlemen the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay said aramis				9.451454201598896

that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the banker s house				60.42790007776199
the darkness lasted two hours longer then by degrees a cold light crept through the venetian blinds until at length it revealed the objects in the room				19.165360251142737

do i turn to the right or to the left hand to the right said caderousse				21.83552117453295
grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and double locked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure				652.7710428223478
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter				1.9835682379645063

he took to his heels and was soon at m de tr√©ville s but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m de tr√©ville s office				28.72732166330567
as he passed by m noirtier s room he perceived two figures through the half open door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further				2569.0480554182914
the bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor ship owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources				1651.1784719041696
this circumstance pleased m de tr√©ville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m de la tr√©mouille s testimony and himself				33.168124133292125
when his patience was exhausted he called his valet				1761.2829972289526

gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerf s defence				1137.5532034870096
one of them went away and dant√®s heard his shoes striking on the pavement				4825.618641922356
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality				471.70147680809686
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london				159.60749844114184
advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down				100.1433509267651
you are the offended party count doubtless what does that imply that you will fire first i fire first oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that and at what distance twenty paces a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips				47.3020236413413
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man				1.1142516142884287
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips				1282.86213989021
i don t believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin how well you reason said porthos admiringly				677.3150329022315
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friend you can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction				192.7771176715919
all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off				135.49097450700168
this probability afforded him his first consolation				343.3534475637146
this strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your reason				341.11969552244574
come planchet let us pay a visit to the king s treasurer and then set off toward paris sir toward paris and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain				969.8116701799564
about half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of greney				1418.0251929621925
the journey at two o clock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barri√®re st denis				57.35394003679609
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation				925.5455068132521
come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m noirtier de villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being not of providence but of fate				1437.5597859899697
for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the king s attorney but can you not say that sir				208.28974808830904
sir said d avrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him his blood has thickened				2078.4834713449136
ah is that you d artagnan and you athos said the young man				1.1093634381170216
when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door				33.46319941360933
50039m oh the magnificent hair said louise with regret				631.4537809215503
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward				2030.8602529508944
that person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect				251.7158223681629
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours				123.77362169222359
you see it is yourself who have first named her you her father have pity on valentine				177.445960523538
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house				29.501507853940787
goodnight and before dant√®s could open his mouth before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoner s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon				56.07844523289242
both got into albert s coup√© and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud to the opera in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance				3416.244837058997
well then the place will the place royale suit you asked d artagnan				1.0058363677841868
you say you fear nothing but death i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans and old age my end will be achieved before i grow old and madness i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom non bis in idem				1378.978545980026
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place royale				28.43127676790966
m bertuccio lay covers for three he then took franz s tablets out of his hand				17.02466056302913
m de tr√©ville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m de tr√©ville hastened to report himself at the louvre				481.4611407327293
in the corridor he again met the pretty kitty that was the name of the soubrette				176.54408753840195
if you arrive safely at home what have i to fear except from you if you reach your home safely leave paris leave france and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well i will send you a small annuity for if you return home safely then then asked caderousse shuddering				57.79459481779707
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye				135.93192347010182
the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerf s are you not no replied madame danglars i am too ill you are wrong replied villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen there do you think so asked the baroness				36.313949389845995
the count s tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune				74.92401283298211
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily				376.5609291287043
as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse				864.0701003234867
a customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded dant√®s was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left shoulder				490.69872519149243
devil take me if i ve ever been so happy as at this moment and he wiped his eyes still moist				3522.349327774606
no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and d artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever				923.4480175956281
ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the bishop of noyon good said d artagnan to himself				3.414179978411037
they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for them a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one				577.1233768920409
here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will				1029.4289107700642
he forgot the necessary slowness of navigation he exaggerated to himself the power of milady				161.92656732288722
i promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner				153.96062853414705
d artagnan however who had consulted with aramis spoke to the poor wretch				565.0412875074142
i had speedy proofs that the excellent abb√© was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held				695.94188022808
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him				2.635191865706458
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel d artagnan began to recover himself little by little				473.9836686711733
he will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to take				238.69357728304612
besides they felt that the d√©nouement of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make				74.22685747248583
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you that is not the custom excellency said peppino				281.67508417003563
poverty was repugnant to her degradation took away two thirds of her greatness				506.35436372457343
another of the number continued the abb√© without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse is called danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse who was about to break in upon the abb√© s speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards				910.267782709807
for my part said d artagnan i say this must come to an end murderer as you were of your uncle				1481.1792692067293
at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment				92.74093415793067
the decanter and the glass were completely empty				201.21936390339067
that voice also was known to grimaud				152.99212475933575
first madame who are you who am i				309.1279014153492
and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass d artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face he had been jeered at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life and m de la tr√©mouille who had nothing to do with the matter with the loss of his h√¥tel				382.2083072457153
ah continued the count be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an account of the execution there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets for i saw the account and copied it down very well you can retire m bertuccio i need you no longer				426.85531786224607
albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother he threw his arms around her neck				564.0377347161971
but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it				5.437245499540417
ah yes happily i have replied valentine				29.54993242767721
never have i met with so remarkable a person as yourself willingly answered the stranger if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting one now alas powerless to aid you in any way say not so you can console and support me by the strength of your own powerful mind				579.8492600046354
i must confess that i was mistaken				133.63191929899588
he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto				244.4958747873125
george villiers placed himself before the glass as we have said restored the undulations to his beautiful hair which the weight of his hat had disordered twisted his mustache and his heart swelling with joy happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for he smiled upon himself with pride and hope				360.7179433381371
to save a man to spare a father s feelings or a mother s sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and i thank god that things are thus and merc√©d√®s raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them				14.97901910336888
at five o clock albert returned delighted with his day s work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome				27.819387919972346
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence				3603.005714907741
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged				4010.7436374368917
the first door barricaded with furniture had aroused in him certain suspicions but without communicating his suspicions to any one he had patiently worked his way into the midst of all that confusion				170.81402796688164
d artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton and paid his bill to the host he resumed his route with planchet already relieved of one of his led horses				95.81104107948443
bonacieux we must have them back again yes without doubt it is necessary cried the queen but how am i to act				211.7865439720601
the noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me				4.803037628809369
in the midst of our misfortunes we are still rich enough not to require assistance from anyone				339.9281928783191
then you know him almost screamed the countess				47.730667769203585
13 paris now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address noirtier repeated the abb√© noirtier i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria a noirtier who had been a girondin during the revolution				395.91243602052845
danglars lost five hundred thousand francs but he rid himself of all his spanish shares				2349.418930956666
then they looked at one another				69.17064429021181
count to possess valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without valentine the earth is desolate i have told you to hope said the count				8.138289546682065
that reply led to several questions about the king s capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely				1512.8421749045556
have i not told you so gentlemen				477.1914287061667
the duke was at windsor hunting with the king				49.17700001999495
in my turn i uttered a cry but a cry of joy				42.468256268705744
a tailor said the host and for what to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes returned albert				142.59951294883
that was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of february				68.48841063553195
in truth madame do you think that can be possible indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or mad				115.56312235010348
it was a very simple natural circumstance and yet it created a profound sensation				348.10387114065867
d artagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast				99.36331848264902
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded				2060.7033414076222
he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions				3115.291085455843
then i will add two words about the young greek girl monte cristo motioned him to be silent				504.0826150256455
he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations				12971.581496391738
twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next morning				39.921914600373135
project gutenberg is a registered trademark				100.91935259082466
it is then buckingham cried felton in a high state of excitement				509.28579301407177
they soon tired of the sport				466.21888197629517
nonsense let us break open the door and if he is too far gone in his madness well we will kill him softly gentlemen said d artagnan drawing his pistols from his belt you will kill nobody if you please good good cried the calm voice of athos from the other side of the door let them just come in these devourers of little children and we shall see brave as they appeared to be the two english gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly				288.37832946143624
the 28th of february in what year in what year you ask me in what year yes replied the young man i ask you in what year you have forgotten then i got such a fright last night replied dant√®s smiling that i have almost lost my memory				913.1483429166132
franz took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by gaetano				483.1081932247745
cama the pilot of the saint ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales do you know observed franz that with such stories you make me think of ali baba s enchanted cavern i tell you what i have been told then you advise me to accept oh i don t say that your excellency will do as you please i should be sorry to advise you in the matter franz pondered the matter for a few moments concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted				654.0269606409249
you will forgive me sir for your heart is of such a generous nature that you can well understand all that has passed in mine				306.7983118448545
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words				341.3408201257911
how pale you are no but i have just met with a terrible adventure				266.6621023572098
you will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan thank you sir thank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her				14.028792863370706
have they then offered a large one inquired cromwell				80.94336510593256
no replied mousqueton parry kept it				18.749536517618218
you will do much better to open the window and let down some bread a chicken and a bottle of wine to your friend planchet who has been this last hour killing himself clapping his hands planchet in fact had bedded and fed his horses and then coming back under the window had repeated two or three times the signal agreed upon				56.51326144988479
you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude				2006.062336002847
while you are fighting if there is a fight he must flee				1458.1788609998273
as the door opened the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter				116.5424380428895
on the 1st morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things				490.76869121136303
instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and life is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no truth in anything you have told me it was a fright of the imagination a dream of your fancy				948.6777381263825
as to d artagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards				90.56909611421737
at ten o clock in the morning the sieur de la coste ensign in the king s guards followed by two officers and several archers of that body came to the city registrar named clement and demanded of him all the keys of the rooms and offices of the h√¥tel				262.5922416300395

madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers				1548.1348988385646

but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then at d artagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look				238.05205232219066

yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin athos shook his dead doubtfully				343.7905403239004
