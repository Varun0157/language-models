the comte de la fere can not be far off only the doors are locked that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders for god s sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve				1265.6934043660292
a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living				351.8209787841483
his majesty i can assure you will be tried on his arrival in london i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis				16.379144116210043
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan				9127.396013681138
at last d artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and d artagnan s blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass				618.4725253791486
on their side the three musketeers were much attached to their young comrade				468.6910590019592
every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine o clock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest s breviary				2038.9449249579154
remember i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers				2150.7134371454617
as to dantès he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it				6.403279822387423
but doctor you see me already so grieved how can i introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow				2075.505374783421
dear me said the young woman endeavoring to read her husband s inmost thoughts while a smile passed over her countenance which froze the impassibility of villefort what is the matter madame where do you keep the poison you generally use said the magistrate without any introduction placing himself between his wife and the door				72.10737160875956
i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours				740.2397534761909
apropos said d artagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain yes in some respects tolerably well olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent				4662.680300918058
come reflect and decide your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied d artagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely d artagnan paused				721.9810016722207
no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door				2.9897757747496256
i am going to fight because i am going to fight answered porthos reddening				5804.149838994689
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses danglars took advantage of caderousse s temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint victor staggering as he went				1235.155651004407
take it then but in exchange caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand				21.87114358062986
during the three weeks that he has been with me i have only had to reproach him with one thing being too severe with the prisoners and who is this cerberus a certain monsieur grimaud my lord and what was he before he went to vincennes he was in the country as i was told by the person who recommended him to me and who recommended this man to you the steward of the duc de grammont he is not a gossip i hope lord a mercy my lord				12.582334376018526
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said d artagnan				1.0093785529074986
it was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of arras				433.8116172642906
come said d artagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match				1996.8403101705662
and so my friends we return to paris				163.67874517343776
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion				4824.422252428568
oh take it take it said the count haydée is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know ali left the room				14.331666546666263
i will however inform monsieur d artagnan of your arrival here comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery				1425.2943009018122
is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir				285.84995302806
in the name of heaven explain yourself oh				136.24145431295915
give me anything you like it is of little consequence go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints				2161.9838092755876
yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion and what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment				4.75496209123122
i hate this life of the fashionable world always ordered measured ruled like our music paper				1395.6367382754988
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm				3585.4318594984757
i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please and i cried d artagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever well that is perfectly right and turning on his heel was about to re enter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which d artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse				125.08658719628568
on the contrary observed d artagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible how so it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends said porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army				312.0871008110671
you should not speak so to an old friend like me caderousse as you said just now you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are no but i was brought up in corsica you are old and obstinate i am young and wilful				5405.214832723868
to men who had risked their lives for him and besides had done him a great service a great service what was that why it seems that i crushed for him a parliament councillor what				63.441296460143136
i will not sleep where i must scorn				4123.002774401996
tell me quickly my time is not my own monsieur said d artagnan on quitting tarbes and coming hither it was my intention to request of you in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten the uniform of a musketeer but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble lest i should not merit it it is indeed a favor young man replied m de tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to believe				869.2220611109782
well for my part i shall go to bed said d artagnan come porthos porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend				115.23010889515332
then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of the bandits had lent him lying in a corner in profound slumber				1392.7694230939842
no she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty				141.56335352441292
you will assist me in the work will you not most undoubtedly				11123.533045982034
her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels				1022.5215955708767
i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me it appears to me that this is quite enough				532.9029824810319
d artagnan hits on a plan				291.16055634656914
have you not mentioned that name to me as for de winter he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright				5099.888487345874
let us not talk about money if you please it is humiliating then you no longer love me said the procurator s wife slowly and sadly				1913.561964823533
i have known persons he continued for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of d artagnan who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward				3228.025998365641
albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departed not however without walking several times to the door of the press room as if he had half a mind to enter				177.0141997205427
porthos was the first who came to himself				63.38695839594193
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order				539.7969273802087
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents				759.9235313583796
i think only that i have known you not a whole year				244.545195096918
in crossing the principal street in derby the four friends perceived blaisois standing in the doorway of a handsome house				118.57205105039867
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead				4972.143015670737
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls				2392.988382309582
at the lesser gate of the castle he s posted there are you a large party sixty let him know this moment sir and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return				3494.13835150545
the night lamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering light valentine thought she saw the door of her library which was in the recess by the chimney piece open slowly though she in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned				747.5864115295273
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter				141.16295499587096
you who have chateau meadows mountains woods you who have forty thousand francs a year you are not happy my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine				259.7032920438142
listen milady said the cardinal the affair is important				2012.8126687833792
my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes and will you go asked kitty				259.66738203461057
make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you				12.088700640189927
as for denying that i am your nephew you will think twice about it now that i have learned some things of which i was ignorant a year ago and how does it concern me what you have learned said de winter				4.642252780207768
when in the middle of the room the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many well known faces in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant				794.0079754621731
positively these four men must be on my side the same evening the cardinal spoke to m de tréville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp				243.25484303861114
what does this mean monsieur cardinal asked the king in a severe tone				9.89552414299694
no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death				1402.2286435222918
you render me still more unhappy hate you blame you you edmond				264.5788469841743
he found the other two friends sitting at table before a good fire drinking a bottle of port and devouring a cold chicken				4521.7165001054345
both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse				9947.620098050334
he resumed his listening but unfortunately the toilet was finished				1805.9391506000509
this must be then an affair of importance and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty five				1062.4585345363137
yes sir who is it a woman accompanied by a servant everyone looked at his neighbor				1349.7581432162397
d artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st leu and followed him instinctively				1832.0454651020607
the table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report				2104.398373286663
d artagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross but nothing absolutely nothing				183.29559106944032
after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to cardinal de retz more ruinous than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president molé whilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes				1124.873552956775
d artagnan hearing the musketeer swear wished to escape from the cloak which blinded him and sought to find his way from under the folds of it				175.61355078623347
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his weapon				8745.161004690166
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags				3708.9812978064115
ah sir cried olivain what are you doing				294.3351504815695
this was the gist of his strange story the first barrel that grimaud had found on passing into the compartment he struck it was empty				298.4031188333556
everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands				3549.731706845999
now said aramis you will please to understand gentlemen that bazin alone can carry this letter to tours				5509.116718065393
lean a little to the left				683.4503199998213
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required				675.334903498915
i will be a sailor instead of the costume of our fathers which you despise i will wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons				10316.254725391034
can he be inconstant before being happy oh no he must have been prevented by monsieur de tréville or monsieur dessessart				2413.148742793715
approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking something but why mother just to please me albert said mercédès				899.926281884308
what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family no sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker				489.81973587026084
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths				2502.540758314997
really madame he said did i alarm you much oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our minds villefort forced a laugh				496.77041387980813
richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself she will arrive she says four or five days after having received the money				297.31289956166705
he passes for a very charitable man				319.7896637358213
ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise d armilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine				309.5899146217478
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope				810.1395341329768
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram				7048.169550566457
what is it you edmond back again said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth				1222.4444357813072
whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel				2077.530253568315
what she cried wringing her beautiful hands what				75.93504700746085
she would have taken d artagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache				1505.5586838180961
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become				7235.205061348071
it was then when the count could not see albert that he sent for his servant who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him				26.20646749629506
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak				157.7401920630283
i come in the name of our master ali tepelini if you come from ali himself said selim you know what you were charged to remit to me yes said the messenger and i bring you his ring at these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view				2032.7940787856112
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved				1042.8595780573241
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought				957.1738741676722
do you know what consoled him				18.060686411541635
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son but villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard				248.16619038581533
it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce you to conceal the truth provided sir the particulars you wish for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience				1272.506211126964
the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit				290.0951379188741
why it is after one o clock your home is a paradise porthos one takes no note of time				3770.721310501665
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed				4185.271513180355
i would rather do so was edmond s reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed				1455.741044722409
how do you dare to disturb me in the exercise of my functions asked the beadle				37562.62575550893
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife				243.33036616918312
very well come this way d artagnan went toward a very small low window just large enough to let a man through				1189.1257178232336
what is this rent said he showing d artagnan a place where it had been pierced through				3891.7935778886945
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down				103.48579300339688
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth				352.31437493900336
mind your own business wife replied caderousse sharply				377.6517062054649
now let us return to the first				203.56195807682727
parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened oh juxon said the king seizing the bishop s two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage				534.7096964342679
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet				314.89409195357956
five minutes after m de tréville was asking d artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour				78.36524904290586
indeed said d artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy				8626.74094574185
if it is a snare replied d artagnan i shall scent it out be assured				1609.6075497067657
d artagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him				1.51611508172104
this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms				3140.0540037621968
a great age you mean monsieur porthos				64.71144553363435
he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d antin				71.0718562649477
how sir she cried as d artagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me				4.415851862350392
feverish and excited i rang at the door				7.2792878547816615
how will this end he said				12.959654233409646
i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour				280.80996133503436
that of rouen but you will leave the city on your right				1154.0040605063914
as he found himself in the quarter in which aramis lived he took it into his head to pay his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to send planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the mousetrap				1461.2693249012477
i have two things to postpone and what are they first a thrust with the coadjutor whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet s and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me oh fie a quarrel between priests a duel between allies what can i do friend				1907.267259895984
bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinalist				5657.68432994469
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhône				2039.200641349129
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels				5451.797434708412
his brain was on fire and life and energy returned				1094.1062094135357
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop				591.6763874988034

as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinal s time athos waved his hand raoul bowed and d artagnan and planchet set out				26.833929945864305
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it				14.623887007152574
why an apology on the ground said the young captain shaking his head				14.277501390506972

but this annoys you let us change the subject				103.9914378146738
we are four of us said d artagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time				376.28199897563434
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution				7001.494987759005
what is the use of one horse for us two				825.3995064606207
although the key was in the door the coadjutor knocked				9122.983866912953
that gentleman appears to be well dressed for the first time in his life who are those gentlemen asked danglars of monte cristo				1.0081274511942009

this celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity				10208.754344804796
bonacieux that he had never spoken to the one or the other that he had come at about ten o clock in the evening to pay a visit to his friend m d artagnan but that till that hour he had been at m de tréville s where he had dined				4729.489970829214
the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road				498.4826739343934
yes milady replied athos the comte de la fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit				725.762664501541

well don t you intend to bring me another plate said dantès				191.4628863706961
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen				2666.581691264828
i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming i am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brother s thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped i know not if he heard these words i think he did not for he fell without a cry				1895.4221536512719
this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville s house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances				2184.017722585023

ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere yes sire replied athos				9.936601600905687
the general remark is oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as m villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters				2472.5857700539127
soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god				2200.0653258164543
his presence produced a good effect				766.1707878979407
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation				508.44187325718343
you have water woods flowers there she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color				830.3497996280723
the steward could not restrain himself				124.33072074130787

there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand				609.1924152094524
the coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his master				129.73646732143243
yes yes said caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy and why because mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens really answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness				668.0646795392043
d artagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword				114.64215336028374
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day				139.11943031449636
then disguised in the clothes of the marquis d o he had left the hotel stumbling over the bodies of an officer and two guards who had been killed whilst defending the street door				65.63716746603656
mother nanette began by picking up the louis then she picked up friquet				3143.7994718609957
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women				374.1054309753076
lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly				982.29495469409
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified				5004.821392558442
indeed my dear friend said beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair albert remained silent and wrapped in thought				2208.5265917047154
i indeed invited them here today on your account				222.63035823494835
yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises charles had heard and understood it all				190.96214130032195
forward blaisois a groan stifled by the grasp of porthos was all the reply of poor blaisois for the giant taking him neck and heels plunged him into the water headforemost pushing him out of the window as if he had been a plank				8838.64013833486
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort i promise on my honor then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into execution and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work at least a year and shall we begin at once at once we have lost a year to no purpose cried dantès				107.36069974852506
you can come he said and led them back to noirtier				255.42642865914155
i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall see at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port				432.378605143631
we have observed that young cavaliers received presents from their king without shame				1031.7085769331713
allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the baron de chantal that the baron de chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen months old and that this little girl was afterward mme				282.1416711200674
and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the father in law i must address myself to the banker and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his turn				26.741336105046308
should he demand an explanation from the bandits or should he wait patiently for them to propose it				5.84414314056408
i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus				16513.241896320855
in the meantime follow me the cardinal alighted the three musketeers did likewise				21611.438465314324
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence				863.5140513284229
one would think one was in the cave of ali baba				2065.6991312975674
the worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to him				4.356571044845203
i am captain dantès a loyal frenchman thought accused of treason tell me where you are conducting me and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied you are a native of marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going on my honor i have no idea have you no idea whatever none at all that is impossible i swear to you it is true				105.42652844720342
or at least i will go later he drew kitty to him				6.468482721752933
i have not tried to discover her other name kitty cried milady				41.16328430658335
ah you are a cardinalist then monsieur are you cried she and you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen private interests are as nothing before the interests of all				1471.8547537167665
the sight of the masked man gave rise to a prolonged sensation				1387.2039216451296
hold your tongue said he and let me answer				74.01458447277237
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience i reside in my father s house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no				248.44976427128816
his two companions were already on horseback				170.56106737982248
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination				446.1054771546969
but i am really glad to have seen such a sight and i understand what the count said that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion 20175m without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed				9518.518821693744
good she exclaimed approaching the table she has taken part of her draught the glass is three quarters empty then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire and although she had just left her bed she could not resist the temptation offered by valentine s sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more rest				1763.3023018733145
has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice				312.2417576195963
bonacieux eagerly and looking at d artagnan with disquiet				5279.036457037104
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart				1971.9292820545054
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m de tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her				26.284948556511466
i wager that i uttered a thousand extravagances while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed him				2.249480194518104
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy which is the young man asked de winter turning around				274.37499188193186
when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have i ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you				27.31165248918819
my god can you not remember her name yes it was pronounced in my hearing once				1715.6976884840592
another motive had influenced albert s selection of his seat who knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival				699.9802312028702
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons				771.9373314901776
among worldly people manner is contagious				6593.98327725189
franz took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the letters of the alphabet successively until he came to m at that letter the old man signified yes m repeated franz				54.33342497786683
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity				4479.533749478327
let us see what this letter contains we here present the letter verbatim to his eminence monseigneur le cardinal mazarini i have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england				121.08682319973938
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father				145.14228520726436
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions				6131.643551921713
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought				1400.1253604155077
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room				20.569029965018746
the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes				1095.7341126046938
there is an abundance of italian masks at the palais royal from harlequin even to pantaloon chevalier				1766.2467449203202
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs élysées and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my departure maximilian hung his head and obeyed with childlike reverence				3400.9276532216236
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it				5.664721309131025
it had been d artagnan s practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles				994.7330437099378
but why has he waited till now				319.7513916399723
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o clock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since and don t you know where he is not at all is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell				823.8247181257713
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d artagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood				2717.9515839416663
we don t want either rope ladders or gag pears now my lord said athos do not let us disturb you				3.221926821289299
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform no one could have said what caused the count s voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased				664.2864741101515
i shall hear this morning that m danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wife s this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france				89.53562006387938
your advice then is to sell the diamond replied aramis				13.060799821847457
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf s remark				6968.992867136576
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent				2684.2403564198576
it was now cromwell s turn to look fixedly at mordaunt and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable				9796.189514916376
charles was impatiently awaiting his return				1257.4100254298614
he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du musée but strange to say he was not there when i returned monsieur morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs monsieur morrel it is his voice said julie				560.6815296034151
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose				1249.9900199849587
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris				73.82058701412252
and to complete the whole haydée was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers				4994.046097405969
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required i know it said athos coolly since here it is and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels				1086.290860510409
do you still wish to do so i have no wishes count only i fancy i could pass the time less painfully here than anywhere else so much the better for i must leave you but i carry your word with me do i not ah count i shall forget it no you will not forget it because you are a man of honor morrel because you have taken an oath and are about to do so again oh count have pity upon me				3.9015950810787237
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying you promise sir that s agreed that i shall find you to morrow at charenton oh don t be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre				1078.989661940753
the party followed him and soon disappeared with him behind the hillocks of sand unobserved				26514.31522994239
he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary				1170.474575973288
on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out who s there and d artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal louis and rocroy after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost				22580.5063523418
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that i will answer for him no he will not desert said the king he can always be found as tréville says				452.32992263314435
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1 f 3 this work is provided to you as is with no other warranties of any kind express or implied including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose				1242.8022372187902
tréville understood admirably the war method of that period in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy must live at the expense of his compatriots				6070.11026562902
some of your people have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested edmond dantès mate of my vessel i know it monsieur replied villefort and i am now going to examine him oh said morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do				130.18581352543976
dantès made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist				6188.716880616183
i asked the price they told me it was 4 500 francs				1002.6285330334069
then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied juxon				17802.61778306255
milady was wrong in fearing that mme				274.52352660981074
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction				675.00104635564
did you see poor barrois die noirtier raised his eyes to heaven				77.06787354386182
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation they are hot royalists said groslow				148.60896418774186
then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an altar				5744.314172798195
will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn				92.4115335573923
it is kept by a friend of ours at last we have something definite said athos let us go to the peacock yes answered aramis but if we are to get there we must rest our horses for they are almost broken winded aramis was right they stopped at the first tavern and made each horse swallow a double quantity of corn steeped in wine they gave them three hours rest and then set off again				279.51159206310723
well you stand well with m morrel i hear you insinuating dog you m				323.8576136246188
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream				6456.3629435499715
now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of kings said d artagnan if you persist in offering him a civility				13104.550273159191

for what reason is all this fume and fury asked athos				6.721983996026364
has such and such a perfume done anything for me				3.6726573721786964
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident as to the rest m de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously				6711.852343506529
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand				29.680897140354332

albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros				32755.175321480026

if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort if i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i can not break				5954.793185962477

is it true said the guard to the two cavaliers that the duc de beaufort has arrived in paris nothing more certain and the best proof of it is said d artagnan that he has dispatched us to meet the duc de vendome his father who is coming in his turn long live de beaufort cried the guards and they drew back respectfully to let the two friends pass				1620.038807685268

the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation				3556.420559361547
then they allow the lackey to remain with him yes stuart begged this favor and harrison consented				21208.720912452933

but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed				29505.548308724905
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there				284.89497119075
and he turned up two cards as usual a king for d artagnan and an ace for himself				30.572536912170797

aramis went to cromwell s desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis				349.69401354257803
he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio				1718.6822866099567
since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all				234.9377405460832
renée was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation				4274.621094720858

m coquenard had since the arrival of porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk				967.6286288509893

the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by milady s pulse that the case was not serious				4420.860762644072
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips				48.23500696180505
a single portrait signed by léopold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame				8260.113846522318
scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him				2.09013843558118

bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him				8.17131074314592
at first athos supported the association for a time with his own means				1914.2610348921744
then d artagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting				15915.0154507778
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow				2424.516526610863
by the way what said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated				136.5164033465954
they were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with eyes of fascination smiles of love and bright and flowing hair				10352.503702841253
monte cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said come gentlemen some coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn				14703.662599974463
let us not depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken				428.0452426385995

d artagnan took out the parcel which he had desired bernouin to place under the seat				14749.742494646245
the sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber				198.771937903359
before questioning me he said reply to my question				251.54748016237244
but with the rapidity of thought d artagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed				4183.012998338076
take care that the french do not take their revenge on you for the sicilian vespers i will do my best the streets are full of armed men continued d artagnan				1.0144026282261212
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head				380.51131823391887
every evening he shuts himself in there				656.7032277245679
danglars more and more delighted with major cavalcanti had offered him a seat in his carriage				224.02025868919148
the old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so and then when d artagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good				696.8470941108736
the moment is at hand he said				18.391798137840404
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole				49915.96452276104
by his advice a decree from parliament summoned the citizens to lay down their arms and demolish the barricades				1127.204396617227

ah monsieur bonacieux i never did love you much but now it is worse than ever				459.80747836656644
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him				48.88171221511721
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give				2620.7600104378353
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation				5189.614776092313
sit down madame and let us talk as the cardinal said milady under the influence of inexpressible terror sat down without uttering a word				43.51617904682293
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmond s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts thanks danglars that will smooth over all difficulties				5799.811810320921
this fawn colored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of la lionne mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queen like grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on raoul				172.75395268709374
the queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke thus				6486.659833219611
she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my care and what is her name haydée replied monte cristo				1.0047665832127421
ah continued caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the south the world grows worse and worse				7048.465309735922
d artagnan went instantly in search of the inn and easily discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it				32.96504883781392
she is not dead demons do not die so easily				1483.0542192332543

and yet notwithstanding these precautions i remained for some time in a terrible agitation of mind				1423.9085231177805
i have studied chemistry because having determined to live in eastern climates i have been desirous of following the example of king mithridates mithridates rex ponticus said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast edward you naughty boy exclaimed madame de villefort snatching the mutilated book from the urchin s grasp you are positively past bearing you really disturb the conversation go leave us and join your sister valentine in dear grandpapa noirtier s room the album said edward sulkily				9853.062180668197
hullo said albert it is monte cristo and his greek the strangers were indeed no other than the count and haydée				3037.7843764380536
but d artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him				7.302755957298464

buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and avenge himself for that little treachery but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy				3245.200216615802
with that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties and when you are full of money again you can redeem it and take it back cleansed from its ancient stains as it will have passed through the hands of usurers athos smiled				27.75563500518379

this cried the voice the tone of which was at once polished and jeering this is nothing but a butchery of horses and not a combat between men				1033.586608107027
upon hearing d artagnan s reply aramis seemed about to draw his sword when athos prevented him				1.6886207512120672
pardon me i love him so much these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace				40820.33854683484
this was a sort of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rose colored glass				612.396735404275
towards the house the chestnut trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air				1381.5242894312428
you will do for me what you have done for the queen certainly d artagnan said to himself he wishes to make me speak out				241.51919853686883

then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean				3511.7436182023766
go and look for the comte de la fere i wish to speak with him aramis found athos and brought him				5.083842635611361

or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight				1715.3549353015087
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch patrol				5701.737270658722
and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard				472.8296971113436
the monk cried the host where is the monk grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard				1411.7144104420868

and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle				7596.29014244947
our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant you will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate the sergeant made a sign of comprehension				2909.0535784026006
the timid girl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman				176.5961201633095
that is the hour when i am expected madame said the young man bowing i can refuse nothing asked of me thus				191.73075526486016
it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me but for my security				5067.468859127996

tomorrow then he added turning towards bertuccio				1285.8090985695076
he drew back the bolt of his door and almost directly an old lady entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her arm and her bonnet in her hand				8.461588391299355
in gold silver or notes half in gold and the other half in bank notes if you please said the count rising from his seat				362.7133531712292
what was most pressing was to get mme				261.5567675585024
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready				1299.1023765454847
have you finished grimaud grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes				40098.698613554836
athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly embarrassed				41248.021896323415
here i await the army of my rebellious subjects				8530.970072075637
athos and d artagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the musketeer				4443.131096331135
yes that is true said she and i will confess to your majesty that my husband your husband has none				1897.5843902617112
i see it in the depths of the inner cavern				5610.305528118783
if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves for my fortune is theirs before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude				53502.08838774673
well said the jeweller as he placed himself at table all i can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad yes chimed in la carconte they will have a wretched night of it the jeweller began eating his supper and the woman who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess				8106.252905320829
dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels				16559.480394329614
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise				2554.026875515008
a handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal next moment d artagnan entered				234.7792757440957

each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold				262.8515620286721
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard				946.3680654486072

suppose the queen should refuse to ratify it ah				390.6874601055661
i have placed reliance upon you my friend				64.75787083887651
well in that case we can manage famously said d artagnan which of the two horses will you ride that which you bought or the one that was given to you that which was given to me assuredly				48645.96117401509
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly				6740.80838328838
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantès				457.1150684624591
tis easy to say so but that requires money and i haven t any ah replied mazarin so you have no money none my lord but the diamond i gave you yesterday i wish to keep it in remembrance of your eminence mazarin sighed				647.9830608576885

besides i care not for his displeasure still situated as we are yes do you know how we are situated				10457.148833845444
on their side from time to time the besiegers took the messengers which the rochellais sent to buckingham or the spies which buckingham sent to the rochellais				3944.9118360960606
you are accused of treason of abuse of power and murder				6481.422270589581
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing more at present go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done and you aramis are you of that opinion entirely so my dear d artagnan very good said d artagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous d artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there				412.3492205845106
on arriving at the extremity of the castle d artagnan found himself overlooking a beautiful valley in which at the foot of a charming little lake stood several scattered houses which humble in their aspect and covered some with tiles others with thatch seemed to acknowledge as their sovereign lord a pretty chateau built about the beginning of the reign of henry iv and surmounted by four stately gilded weather cocks				3717.281675251689
i know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and i am brave also				954.7051139527399

consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz d épinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my daughter s hand on whomever i please what said the count the approbation of whose eye villefort had frequently solicited during this speech				16910.340541177833
we need not say she stopped at the first floor				2111.3326112037316

we must play the game to the end and consent to be blindfolded ah you shall see i promise you i will sustain my part to admiration i never once doubted your doing so monte cristo chose this moment for re entering the drawing room				15.202456164186406
it is true we plundered them a little when we took them and i will even confess that it is their purse that monsieur du vallon and i draw on in our nightly play				6220.011524681657
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother and to rush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of anyone he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles				344.1152791652937
what do you mean by that nothing my lord monsieur d artagnan belongs to the service monsieur d artagnan makes it his business to defend the cardinal who pays him as much as we make it ours we citizens to attack him whom he robs you are an intelligent fellow my friend can we count upon you you may count upon me my lord provided you want to make a complete upheaval of the city tis that exactly				22265.88247506572
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having poisoned constance bonacieux who died yesterday evening he turned towards porthos and aramis				13.648749937605002
yes was the reply in a low voice				6.398274332145536
yes replied the brigadier and as his head is valued at a thousand roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch him the two young persons exchanged looks				1723.8350145660052

they will return said d artagnan				1.006905913334725
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action				2214.9641241935137
whom does your highness wish me to send to you any one except grimaud the officer of the guard then with his chessboard yes five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess				18088.53929773573
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly				36382.02456480806
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it				8.149450148430898
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues				5002.783749442167

at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes				18318.909052410447

dantès was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones				2602.3175092289653
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door				15.32754369042866
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat				571.2064275966535
my dear count said albert advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor thanks i offered last night and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you will never be effaced from my memory believe me as long as i live i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important service you rendered me and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my life my very good friend and excellent neighbor replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions				31166.715078223107
the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted				1381.82932996254
the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice				1376.1356118858107
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m de rothschild and you have seen her her 20183m the beautiful greek of yesterday no we heard i think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains where was this window with white hangings asked the countess				8459.327999690815
a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat				2731.5314003432454
we say aramis because the young man entertained no doubt that it was his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the exterior				45191.66671039581

if he were minister and i were his d artagnan instead of belonging to that beast of a mazarin mordieu				5657.446929043219
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted				937.5721049555684
he first advanced towards the baroness who was chatting with madame de villefort who had come alone valentine being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the road left for him he passed from the baroness to eugénie whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck				3737.226412243928

tell me what this count of monte cristo has done for you 30157m i own that your question embarrasses me valentine for i can not say that the count has rendered me any ostensible service				441.67982059192457
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls				19155.622650391062
then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel				457.300380047073
parry said the king rising too my horse i desire to go to thirsk egad said d artagnan to athos your king has thoroughly taken me and i am quite at his service if what you say is sincere replied athos he will never reach london how so because before then we shall have carried him off well this time athos said d artagnan upon my word you are mad have you some plan in your head then asked aramis				14.64750340779291

no madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a christian what you are ignorant of lord de winter s designs upon me i am impossible you are his confidant i never lie madame oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine them i seek to divine nothing madame i wait till i am confided in and apart from that which lord de winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to me why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world can not equal in horror you are deceived madame said felton blushing lord de winter is not capable of such a crime good said milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime then aloud the friend of that wretch is capable of everything whom do you call that wretch asked felton				53.79574875686264
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation				3970.8124413667324
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds				1794.88595141013
now said he i may require to go in one night from paris to tréport let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road which will enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours your highness had already expressed that wish said bertuccio and the horses are ready				559.8111672090813
and what will that signify to me				4.081708772419974
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears				7027.242549285804

who are these gentleman three of the king s musketeers				333.6103571901915
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle				5591.0770993498845
have you never seen anyone enter your room at night oh yes i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium then you do not know who it is that attempts your life 50073m no said valentine who could desire my death you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening				20170442.562650453
what you tell me is horrible sir				97.4371369028656
she was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed				146.95600929889196
at this moment a horse without a rider covered with foam his nostrils extended and eyes all fire galloped up and recognizing his master stopped and neighed with pleasure it was arthur				40138.06801846137
again the wounded man opened his eyes and looked in astonishment at these strangers who appeared to pity him				4.1309118042578366

i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away i suppose to the spaniards there s no use in thinking any more about athos				258.25290132567227
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous				3339.390253381428
it appears according to your account that if by mischance a musketeer is arrested france is in danger				2291.242000939441
never had he been so well received				247.1864235576754
what attempt to murder me in my father s house in my room on my bed of sickness				45017.069540889155
such was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our readers to the study of cardinal mazarin once that of cardinal richelieu				394.2762220772442
yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads				4427.151381485296
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart				99.87877256193886
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came				1284.544238211536
dead no dying saddled yes saddled and bridled then we are upon the fugitives courage we have them but if they are numerous observed mousqueton tis not we who have them but they who have us nonsense cried d artagnan they ll suppose us to be stronger than themselves as we re in pursuit they ll be afraid and will disperse certainly remarked porthos				10.132129347164303
you must hope for us both maximilian that will make me at least partly happy but why must you leave me so soon i do not know particulars				50936.49996652329
this itinerary possessed another great advantage that of leaving franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of signor pastrini s story in which his mysterious host of monte cristo was so strangely mixed up				371.3929426876554
adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme				80.78442533009402

the petition finished villefort read it aloud				789.4019359769756
i think i learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between us what i have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest hush said milady let us not even here speak thus of him				26.87462460073088
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution				23871.271473331642
you are not willing that i should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul but i repeat it again to you replied felton in great emotion no danger threatens you i will answer for lord de winter as for myself dunce cried milady dunce				3263.1005807001034
oh tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto d artagnan s				39.24231768303118
the inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for				455.90019820127196
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter				282.9659618836195
on the contrary when one aims a blow that is the regulation way to strike				1352.4163120581095
0081m you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken				1112.2222651362965
the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished				10313.40199921191
ah it is m de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely				8493.708514527421
what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation				7562.534080843184
on the contrary we shall meet again said mercédès pointing to heaven with solemnity				3967.1825010385423
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors				8181.627868365938
the queen has not only one son but two then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal no my lord but he will be answered the guard				6357.321156036313
but i give you warning that if in polishing your chapel utensils you forget how to brighten up my sword i will make a great fire of your blessed images and will see that you are roasted on it bazin scandalized made a sign of the cross with the bottle in his hand				12.624423687148225
still further the jew told them that if they would sell it to him as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings he would give five hundred pistoles for it				12.311570751710514
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary				107.69787703518585
the devil take the madman murmured m de tréville unless added he this is a cunning mode of escaping seeing that he had failed in his purpose chapter iv				9691.483235410575
presently the door opened and she perceived felton				441.83780585307187
madame bonacieux presented her cheek to him				10.864107109127762
and very princely added château renaud				1.5824498003628629
ah wretch cried she you have basely betrayed me and still more you have my secret				119.72423530496413
you understand my dear girl continued d artagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in oh my god				139.1684622278867
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers				4135.363820899095
if i were not in such haste and if i were not running after someone said d artagnan				1.0047372578016138
on arriving at its gates they were astounded to see the threatening aspect of the capital				3672.551774801264
bernouin shut the door and went away				470.90142380279354
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart alas my dear aramis said d artagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are relating how yes a woman whom i love whom i adore has just been torn from me by force				921.1189490627147
villefort placed the arm of madame de saint méran within his own and conducted her to his apartment				177.88971646217655
still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure				660.0038538257189
however he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night				98.61968863925414
has he not seen monsieur d artagnan at my house oh yes yes you are right				66.81914563142492

i did not seek one i did not ask for one				453.24428302706787
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan				64539.714945727705
you have never seen our africans count said albert				109.57487072940447
i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall think for how do i know to the contrary that this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it i will come count i will be sure to come said villefort eagerly				33.66388528921925
as to planchet he has certain reasons for not going to court and what are they oh he doesn t stand well with his eminence mouston said porthos saddle vulcan and bayard and for myself monsieur shall i saddle rustaud no take a more stylish horse phoebus or superbe we are going with some ceremony ah said mousqueton breathing more freely you are only going then to make a visit oh				735.6617788338232
to the hotel to be sure to get our baggage and horses and from there if it please god to france where at least i understand the architecture of the houses so suiting the action to the word d artagnan thrust the remnant of his sword into its scabbard picked up his hat and ran down the stairs followed by the others				1726.0475825901542
wait for me here all of you cried m morrel i will take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence i will bring you word how all is going on that s right exclaimed a multitude of voices go and return as quickly as you can this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind				6356.866461254585
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other abbés and what was the end of the affair we met in the place royale egad				3295.7231690258086
of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death it is i who no longer understand you madame said felton				85.16272734686319
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise				32944.33306278925
d artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal this was his second interview with richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last				2983.662776182912
oh grace grace pardon cried the wretch falling on her knees				141.30950136205928
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				1825.0909656163483
i have my sword and no one waiting for you outside no then you had better come with me thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it				5.419294955315648
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses				218.57252085651209
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort				66.84703056834844
finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself				31.65295788131632
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts				40402.406557583025
they were influenced by hatred by avarice and by self love but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment				10616.548671411518
pardieu beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed				847.5094087119265
you know it is you alone whom i love how can i know that by the scorn i will throw upon her d artagnan took a pen and wrote madame until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor besides i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them				182.38372772622037
and on what floor does he live asked comminges				593.5023445364482
ah may you be a true prophet said d artagnan laughing				28.771306150685724
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment				282.95058043158167
noirtier looked the permission which she solicited				48276.28017383219
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m de morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him but i have since learned that you had that right				123.86324627574503
you may see matters differently d artagnan and think otherwise				1218.312794445267
the four friends saw all this not a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them				18.35362300436884
the next day just as debray was signing the deed that is about five o clock in the afternoon madame de morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the coupé of the diligence which closed upon her				6.2857382691344155
certainly monsieur speak he said softening his stern accented tones as if he were speaking to a woman				414.83334196324984
i might as well say count benedetto				5322.379061777061
come in come in monsieur porthos the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity				12943.629214489758
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot				2698.549755157648

it is in london they must be found what are your eminence s orders not a word of what has passed				1424.59852629962
after the king and the cardinal m de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens				61817.53663753578
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman				57437452.023771755
monsieur your friend pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears but we do not know that name monsieur your friend having disabled two men with his pistols retreated fighting with his sword with which he disabled one of my men and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it you villain will you finish cried d artagnan athos what has become of athos while fighting and retreating as i have told monseigneur he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him and as the door was open he took out the key and barricaded himself inside				2498.849013529357
the guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron				2854.595820482246
then i should like to have three sons i should make the first a nobleman like athos the second a good soldier like porthos the third an excellent abbé like aramis				40.01362221966246
but after all asked porthos who is milady a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine				86.54543338717882
read me her letter oh my lord said laporte				155274.30946627603
but now we are alone although it is immaterial to me where are we going into normandy if you like delightful shall we be quite retired				1213.8819331261727
read the letters and see if i have lied or spoken the truth but mazarin notwithstanding this permission instead of reading the letters took the knife which the dying buckingham had snatched out of the wound and sent by laporte to the queen				40.800349327033025
20245m why should he doubt it said beauchamp to château renaud				1805.8805941047137
we shall be very unfortunate if after meeting so often this evening we should not succeed in meeting to morrow oh as to that sir replied chatillon for it was he who with flamarens was leaving the duc de beaufort you may be assured for if we meet by night without seeking each other much more shall we meet by day when wishing it i hope that is true said aramis				24.900813998068777
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from you your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well well i must tell you				4.870994892783241
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure				6879.044540710985
can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this letter which i have just received said the astonished athos				88.20863466106876
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse				94.25575870158589
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone				2187.5499509646406
come cheer up is there anything that i can do for you i wish to see the governor i have already told you it was impossible why so because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it what is allowed then better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but i wish to see the governor if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hunger that is all the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone				20.10847382864126
athos never received any letters athos never had concerns which all his friends did not know				166.34575907454473
oh said the count i only know two things which destroy the appetite grief and as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not that and love				861.5932921357444
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment				10284.133441519969
well then said d artagnan gaily let us sell the diamond and say no more about it the fusillade continued but the four friends were out of reach and the rochellais only fired to appease their consciences				390009.4165130986
bring hither that horse friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road				809.0998834180417
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks				266.8432317094268
it was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brother in law she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving england she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be murdered buckingham cried the monk				142.93022403748904
speak madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart				1655.3629832496188
impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing up				842.4672598171112
the porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the count s approach				22225.446469654606
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me but i can not leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped				152.2030714780325
really porthos you are a gifted individual i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera				10921.968867707967
see what good fortune i brought you said morrel when he was alone with the count				86.00429196156861
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls				110.06517527929034
you are young replied athos and your bitter recollections have time to change themselves into sweet remembrances epilogue la rochelle deprived of the assistance of the english fleet and of the diversion promised by buckingham surrendered after a siege of a year				257.2036302695096
but felton that s another thing				271.1570914308954
his first cry was for his father but that father was dead my father too is dead said morrel				23.61611057358588
my dear athos he said i am going away				814.9159227739422
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her				7.979906608689042
are all these crimes committed on his account ah then you at length understand heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him valentine you are an angel but why is my grandfather allowed to live it was considered that you dead the fortune would naturally revert to your brother unless he were disinherited and besides the crime appearing useless it would be folly to commit it and is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been invented by a woman do you recollect in the arbor of the hôtel des postes at perugia seeing a man in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana				28244.644232507355
d artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not so				253.59245095435006
for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy				60679.02392853629
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point				545.1378737708621
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings				96518.81921955648
i will expose all to whom to m danglars by heaven cried caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir to caderousse s great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the count s breast flew back blunted				20488.12769629036
you here at this hour said she				63.898335958229644
no the sacrifice returned château renaud ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us the history to which m morrel alludes continued château renaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories				2985.4730265863996
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited d artagnan to drink				4117.933610795303
hang it cried d artagnan another twenty pistoles lost				1499.932223019857
you are there sir he said respectfully				5276.4594317248375
as to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail				5422.738618280581
porthos opened his mouth to reply d artagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed				1795.5279674419767
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast				2656.281935387236
in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves				315737.4588447401
the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney				58735.72887222152
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars				717.3900515048373
you must love somebody no i am alone in the world then you will love me				5.418076033238876
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m morrel left on old dantès chimney piece and which you tell me is still in your hands caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt				2762.6546724604327
at what time you please sir replied franz				49.69817386355473
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends aramis shook his head				6.69799283228285
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothing the cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage				1456.1937018115107
i did not lose sight of him for an instant				318.5734539662132
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dantès listening ears mingled with brutal laughter				1446.9947392999104
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d artagnan				1.0118876694316354
30193m excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap i am not up there i know but i have only just come down do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i had twenty one five more than last year				994.9061876493406
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal				140355.86093374126
god preserved me but a man named brisemont died in my place we bear witness to this said porthos and aramis in the same manner as before				416.2615947571767
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully				37350.69094001303
i was mistaken said the host he s not quite dumb				37548.1204398089
thank you parry when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall				15954.587405117223
i am not precisely rich though i am pretty well off hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of you				5.078729614170716
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at porthos				149.12410250603173
the duke had thrown himself as he was wont to do in moments of dullness and vexation on his bed				476.69768931810887
all the rest of the square was paved with heads				8276.799378381365
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain				4296.466131239979
i say there for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there				260.601415389293
i confess i am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in italy justice is only paid when silent in france she is paid only when she speaks				61974.7892251947
all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious				1684.583456408674
she fell into so deep a reverie that her eyes gradually closed				640.3376412246497
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries				71373.9181743745
bravo bravo morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained				60580.034698259304
andrea read in a low voice you are poor a miserable old age awaits you				21.020223953213414
carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him				11.953820903741544
on entering this holy place the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent the passions he fled from entering with him				4.469927859274288
good it is by my side				613.0357020833483
during the period that the duc de bassompierre passed in the bastile where he remained for twelve long years when his companions in their dreams of liberty said to each other as for me i shall go out of the prison at such a time and another at such and such a time the duke used to answer as for me gentlemen i shall leave only when monsieur du tremblay leaves meaning that at the death of the cardinal du tremblay would certainly lose his place at the bastile and de bassompierre regain his at court				840.7288062463999
i confess i began to be very uneasy on your account but your host behaves very well toward you as it appears my dear porthos said d artagnan directing the sick man s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles				336.25767955153293
i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero				1855.772424415728
then at least turn the gem inside you silly fellow for everybody must be aware that a cadet from gascony does not find such stones in his mother s jewel case you think then i have something to dread asked d artagnan				1.0073521135685854
i have chosen the drawing room sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker s study				355.6530676523924
ah cried the cardinal i thought you were a gascon my friend i am a gascon said i only when i succeed the answer pleased him and he laughed				2194.570859952701
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eugénie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone haydée may hear you perhaps and you think she would be angry no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression				878.1665979968401
go and promote digestion by working said the procurator gravely				80.2956529700811
i am going to beauchamp in whose journal this paragraph appears and i shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses beauchamp will never retract then we must fight no you will not for he will tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name we will fight nevertheless				59722.33314572192
maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room				25.22371525780224
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance asked richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance				785.709299391041
on entering the banker s mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of m andrea cavalcanti				205.5076628694595
did she stay long there an hour and a half did she return home directly well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening				54.440972566125815
bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead				629.7527499474107
baron have you any report more recent than this dated the 20th february and this is the 3rd of march no sire but i am hourly expecting one it may have arrived since i left my office go thither and if there be none well well continued louis xviii make one that is the usual way is it not and the king laughed facetiously				14347.651002563203
debray stretched himself upon a large couch and madame danglars passed into her dressing room with mademoiselle cornélie				15870.727825583652
well said danglars did you see him i have just left him answered caderousse				34.5511272396559
he must be mad said the inspector				35.01284814816405
ah you philosophize replied villefort after a moment s silence during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath well sir really if like you i had nothing else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation why in truth sir was monte cristo s reply man is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had nothing else to do				120.11690776214984
that is i murmured milady in extreme terror what do you want we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos you shall be free to defend yourself				420.03680186744526
you have an order signed by the cardinal said the governor				97.25044723435487
when that is over you sir can return to paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her mother in law as you please sir said franz				53.614810848917976

within two leagues of this place at the inn of the red dovecot in that case i am lost said d artagnan				1.005548000508398
however the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him				71.4289991558263
mazarin especially yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreigner well he would be more justly estimated				9225.3216584525
king of france who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy				1406.827683688099
i saw her and you know who she is i believe i can guess at least listen said aramis				28.156757801045334
now asked porthos what are we to do now we shall make use of your shoulder friend porthos if this door proves to be locked				3762.9726246230225
i increased in wickedness till i committed crime				23906.652362343815
the perspiration poured forth upon the young man s brow and he felt as if he should faint				4506.794934029686
unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn you love valentine that daughter of an accursed race never had morrel witnessed such an expression never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face never had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous nights of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire				2738.1273744720147
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit				8820.224723785288
the treasure if it existed was buried in this corner				883.758205644899
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish				6666.654684168641
tis well we will see if the king s name is not a passport everywhere replied the gascon				42.43633332476092
and where am i inquired monte cristo laughingly				598.5815190094323
d artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered and found athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance and beginning to grow uneasy				7139.975217224075
d artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge				2787.3166149462645
these men are going to behead your father				114.83550459359884
his looking glass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper				71019.3534467803
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped				80.9584192593083
i am cold i am hungry				3502.993397657779
it was situated in a very private spot				87377.87633101837

they walked from one end of the chateau to the other porthos looking with wondering eyes at d artagnan who was counting on his fingers				2701.049817532918
but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait athos stopped				81.66130455660627
come said d artagnan after a conference of five minutes duration let us begin our journey where are we to go asked porthos				8.031184783881221

i am a priest and confessions die in my breast				541.3293130143841
at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio				1880.1562869324434
d artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m de tréville to treat for a supply of horses and that he had brought back four as specimens				80084.3981335444
porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall aramis seized his knife d artagnan arose				368.4797218271719
she had in her first marriage i don t think d artagnan i am telling you anything new married a lawyer they thought that nauseous you can understand that s a word bad enough to make one kill thirty thousand men				420.8335055879896
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he can not recollect when he received it				17.812763259970296
our magnificence makes you smile count said maximilian who had followed him with his eyes				44.670914393941224
during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath				625.4961826751048
my young vicomte replied scarron i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive raoul blushed again				73.97753619886112

yes my lord ah that is true said de guiche i had forgotten it that is easily understood it was you who took him count said raoul smiling				27.429799916855895
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself				1662.8454074529272
then that person is a most amiable person albert looked around and perceived franz				172.982531047105
you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both fernand and danglars in order that i may execute edmond s last wishes the agitation of caderousse became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated brow				273.5716829920779

i know what is become of vasiliki and haydée				1465.5447844990258
the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriage window the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo				1.0675020175101644
nay do not press my hand edmond you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness				22265.542727253818
the inquiry m de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil				943.1083499445471
if i am happy in an error do not have the cruelty to lift me from it				13.088565132387407
i wish to be sure of my revenge				3264.89354779236
hardly had d artagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication				52382.17096860673

the audience m de tréville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving d artagnan s response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent				1175.3694995533501

30297m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need				3148.657243447523

soldiers are big children but as i maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed d artagnan could not restrain a smile				298.6451093834896

but know you who he was he used to be the headsman of bethune you knew him				42.63287647250294
planchet was equally seized with admiration and said no more about going away				191.80189660314446

he was an italian and therefore superstitious				11556.808927837978
i thought so madame stammered the young girl				14.443809479038507
italy seems fated to misfortune and the old man bowed his head				17.86301956551991

this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air à l anglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures				4725.549529676158
he was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected humility				1346.8990204837287
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light				503.81419845068154
she could scarcely believe in her happiness and d artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written				5585.374698004886
but not before one o clock replied d artagnan				1.0103898046949484
my faith said d artagnan to athos you had a triumphant idea				2204.6661180904534
there is the hullabaloo louder than ever d artagnan in fact heard a great noise on the side next the cellar				402.2647149557953
oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed valentine perceiving all these signs of agitation				1293.811837507287
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half				6447.723924892026
is it you aramis said porthos				13.331597971693212
the cardinal however did not unseal the letter at once but continued to turn it again and again in his hand then in accordance with his usual custom and judging from experience that few people could hide anything from him when he began to question them fixing his eyes upon them at the same time he thus addressed the messenger you are very young monsieur mordaunt for this difficult task of ambassador in which the oldest diplomatists often fail my lord i am twenty three years of age but your eminence is mistaken in saying that i am young				1778.7445440818274
athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him				23.412883717433083
faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell				379.1162346964493
i am hardly nineteen i know nothing i have no part to play				25175.74914419035
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his grace s lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written				1611.3953299758846
he hastened to open the secrétaire and found the pocket book in the drawer and in it the letter of credit				3551.417980648709
one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not blaspheme unhappy child the crime is that of your father not yours of your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive after that i ceased to blaspheme but i cursed my father				61.11403042479748
certes if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the baron				1186.0066731166228
at that moment patrick entered the room crying a letter from france my lord from france cried buckingham forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came				1426.5916312773063
she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance				4732.449714439163
but the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his eminence				189.03008193593823
mademoiselle de villefort is the culprit she is the poisoner				22474.29063519565
but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantès return on a mission of vengeance				538.2321775238346
then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the jesuit entreated me to get him made a musketeer without a thesis cried d artagnan without a thesis				4506.657399661813
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is decisive				7498.74591049103
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground				174.59132014731017
come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me				3.701006599110608
and you did not tell him that you came from me no sir at ten o clock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter				3.136881042548954
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of buckingham				737.6087845775193
am i mistaken then said monte cristo				1.004092097369099
his hat was a little napless his feather was a little faded his gold lace was a little tarnished his laces were a trifle frayed but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen and porthos was still the handsome porthos				1406.4929804799394
he is pursued but where is he				889.165764566959
that will do me great honor said the leader of the posse and i accept thankfully then to yours monsieur what is your name boisrenard monsieur boisrenard to yours my gentlemen				260.34878405341385
why your protégé m andrea cavalcanti ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize m andrea at least not as concerns m danglars and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it what do you think he is paying his addresses i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions				1730.8979967194
but pray sit down thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow				3679.286087136653
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly				1672.998522752259
outside this door a spade was placed against the wall i took it and advanced towards the thicket				2513.6463523309867
and you have come here with that purpose grimaud repeated the sign				11763.098042331387
the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which morcerf had formed no previous idea				8718.530201968828
my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said morcerf				160.87741865781896
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian				1743.4673741740446
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman				318.8013969659669
and you assisted and took part in this great battle bragelonne cried the former musketeer				330.28891314184773

have you not yet divined who he is what cried felton he again he always he				1015.519220295839
the perfidious deceiver was as may plainly be perceived already sacrificing in intention the poor girl in order to obtain milady willy nilly				9461.005342996385
it would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel upon such horses well my dear aramis you may enjoy that pleasure for one of those three horses is yours ah bah				1006.6861483653296
at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be				2149.917765259259
the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner				599.9702975103198
gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach				1010.0952877034391
one of the three will certainly be at home perhaps all three				4515.558499171195
still further monsieur de tréville gains ten thousand crowns a year he is therefore a great noble				3414.612976469267
but for heaven s sake resumed aramis				29.356940717694417
three or four times he started up imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing him				2.4703983858033554
what monsieur i have a miraculous balsam for wounds a balsam given to me by my mother and of which i have made a trial upon myself well well i am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure you and at the end of three days when you would be cured well sir it would still do me a great honor to be your man d artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his courtesy without throwing the least doubt upon his courage				2717.437112576197
i told him very humbly for i could not conceal from myself the scrape i had got into by laying hands on one of his majesty s musketeers i told him i was quite ready to submit to his conditions				1475.1718491673387
you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20 000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself				58.186644547290776
those barrels i saw through the door port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum				322.10714026336996
i say i am entirely of porthos s opinion replied aramis				11.740497224946196
d artagnan did not know london he did not know a word of english but he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the duke s hôtel				933.1396416559996
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant if the expression may be used				514.0575990158749
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself				535.1645002772487
and what else does your worship wish for to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom the viscount de bragelonne				320.45153393983634
holland loved her and she responded to his love madame de chevreuse was not queen murmured anne of austria overcome in spite of herself by the expression of so profound a passion				3979.205410968337
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here				253.70118340920047
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m				502.26201862887416
but there the confidence of d artagnan stopped				296.9721385295696
as our house is carried on very regularly and we make out our bills every week at the end of eight days we presented our account but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky moment for at the first word on the subject he sent us to all the devils				4511.602676898999

d artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal s letter it was however merely a letter of introduction				8725.375835443081
he turned round it was danglars				783.3652123681703
on on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis i came here only to meet de chatillon i have met him i am contented tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul				79.59522301493358
i see they kept their promise no monsieur returned monte cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends				221.77097019781348
château renaud who has lived in russia will tell you the name of one and major cavalcanti who is an italian will tell you the name of the other this one is i think a sterlet said château renaud				1.2076076276867593
good thought gondy she is going to yield she is going to have him killed said d artagnan to porthos but at all events it shall not be by me				263.713538831762
notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna he slid down like peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his feet				35.140751127838335
he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino				6037.997601380288

meantime d artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword				99.96367800166783
why you must have lost your senses whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel listen to me franz said albert i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us				154.03721853522273
so my dear mother i am going at once to ask franz to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants you my poor child suffer poverty and hunger				2659.270290744577
good bye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man				1.0820264777882167
whence it came no one knew and it spoke an unknown tongue				4558.94560669708
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe				1052.4545950168979
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore				1048.6384412165382
dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous				14724.374391693767
the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic a bon mot which had great success				8394.785836526535
and any other love but mine would have sunk beneath this ordeal but my love came out from it more ardent and more eternal				8757.446157846558
what s the matter at the château d if said the captain				47.85855516230623
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips				33.3277403838387
morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream				955.494368979448
then you pity me sincerely madame and you understand what brings me here you wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just happened yes sir a fearful misfortune you mean a mischance a mischance repeated the baroness				48.18692593192925
we can dispose of the business if we please in an hour for i have received a letter from m delaunay in which he offers to purchase the good will of the house to unite with his own for 300 000 francs				248.67140212099062
they then rang the bell and carrying away four swords out of five they took their road intoxicated with joy toward the hôtel of m de tréville				5.349644373830538
the fact was in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day				119.69563715005464
he therefore found d artagnan alone and as it was nearly eight o clock he took the young man with him				8.1540329841307
well he shall live mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristo s eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect them far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir				10008.3971366246
she saw d avrigny curiously examining the glass which she felt certain of having emptied during the night				67.55600147335012
he wouldn t listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallows bird				2260.279400983993
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask				634.0582379003074
she only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm the fair round arm of a woman but twenty five years old and who yet spread death around her				10.052408061345254
parry had not quitted his master and since his condemnation had not ceased to weep				263.105618283163
although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x in 1829 who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat pocket but at his button hole ah interrupted morcerf laughing beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the corsaire or the charivari but spare my future father in law before me then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron i do not know him returned monte cristo but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance for i have a credit opened with him by the house of richard blount of london arstein eskeles of vienna and thomson french at rome as he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at maximilian morrel				400.32803476907156
passing alongside one of them d artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of meung the same whom the unknown gentleman had called milady and whom d artagnan had thought so handsome but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair wind his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a glimpse of her				32.52707534990687
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didn t mean mischief that s my opinion too said the captain and i ll take precautions accordingly				7626.537563509277
now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the countess g was ah to be sure replied château renaud the lovely venetian is it not herself at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile				191.28703858915634
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit				11624.778810096135
what would you have said the musketeer				200.6883172570927
there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly				2163.652472099287
come he said tis a warning from heaven				86.86800659557355
i do not know for i have never had it madame have you any friends i had three two of whom have left paris to go i know not where				815.3240362347691
at eleven o clock came in his turn duhallier captain of the guards bringing with him fifty archers who were distributed immediately through the hôtel de ville at the doors assigned them				257.3676579100892
and if i do not possess that talent which your smiles prove to me you doubt should i not still have that ardent love of independence which will be a substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self preservation				7514.208771860629
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d armilly of whom he had heard much				1368.4782299117544
you see it s evident where the count got the name but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me in the first place because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success i trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not				83.65119970981885
the usurper converted decidedly my dear duke in what way converted to good principles				11747.94085764042
the king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle				1177.9414574113498
albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him				40.945157256692546
occasionally by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along the horizon the road stretched itself before them white and solitary the flash extinct all remained in darkness				186.35394235921277
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together				1223.6183907668744
i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this continued the jesuit and in his enthusiasm he struck a st chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its weight				1739.6830251797078
villefort who did not choose to reveal the whole secret lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness				602.2401122215078
this mystery required an explanation at least so d artagnan declared to himself				19.098672239424744
but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of château renaud this was followed by rather an awkward silence				526.5450631169828
he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure				1372.8932528465782
well it is not that the man is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any other no m andrea cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men s faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind				1163.1626215497313
ah it is no then yes valentine fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before noirtier she opened it and seeing that the old man s eye was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her finger quickly up and down the columns				28779.58965684355
the young man was overwhelmed as he read				3157.0883443366447
that we are not able to say but at all events we have seen by the anterior developments of this story that buckingham had the advantage over him and in two or three circumstances particularly that of the diamond studs had thanks to the devotedness of the three musketeers and the courage and conduct of d artagnan cruelly mystified him				4.785037880134226
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself				124.52895148210497
the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt				928.71219071953
but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the banker s daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise d armilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company				1976.3262675968585
i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder				1881.9313539969453
ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me i wish my lord would make me one promise what				36.45230612039461
i give you 45 000 francs that is 2 500 livres of income a fortune such as i wish i had myself and you are not satisfied and the five and forty thousand francs inquired caderousse in a hoarse voice where are they				43833.23264516985
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake				33933.871728650265
close by here monsieur replied the notary a little beyond passy a charming situation in the heart of the bois de boulogne so near as that said the count but that is not in the country				461.6861407190933
fernand dashed his on the ground				126.1125664223412
at these words he took up a silver bell and rang it the officer entered				80.5176465147955
halt he cried this time we shall be pursued				981.4896460364633
each one stretching out his hand to the bag took his seventy five pistoles and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed				10106.373227197795

the silence of the oratory was at last disturbed by the slight rustling of silk and d artagnan started when he perceived the tapestry raised by a white hand which by its form its color and its beauty he recognized as that royal hand which had one day been presented to him to kiss				1503.881154098672
on the sixth day the smugglers returned				896.1827377080172
well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier				2621.8574554651454
the steward gave him a gun this was what vampa longed for				281.2841015792602
that is my failing a capital failing i admit but with that exception i am a good drinker athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d artagnan was shaken in his conviction				1541.6177267547312
for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword				2058.730203228255
you see mercédès said the young man here is easter come round again tell me is this the moment for a wedding i have answered you a hundred times fernand and really you must be very stupid to ask me again well repeat it repeat it i beg of you that i may at last believe it				35.46694483990956

everywhere were swords pistols cuirasses and arquebuses and it was plain that as soon as his gout was better monsieur de bouillon would give a pretty tangle to the enemies of the parliament to unravel				26514.062370933596
we are going to execute your wishes may heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe				2444.3783030665636
the cardinal made an approving gesture and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used in coming				2635.3919187105994
some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two				634.7876049156893

she revives cried the young man				1.1969497134739597
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness				1681.5089304925439
the three friends for as we have said athos had sworn not to stir a foot to equip himself went out early in the morning and returned late at night				46.05523215972989
and what kind of a man a genuine englishman your eminence				488.5913294498484
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared				28.865477800842697
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity				1761.8844290404534

the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on progressively				27118.400404468797
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos quietly				581.0371860317607
they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties				10675.39408940369
porthos placed his hand on the pistols				1924.0198265556407
those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry long live broussel down with mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten				2948.567408170679

the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground				102.86271087610655

in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers				1185.5956025701967
it is he who in an encounter with your eminence s guards decided the victory in favor of the king s musketeers it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail it is he who knowing it was i who had madame bonacieux carried off has sworn my death ah ah said the cardinal i know of whom you speak i mean that miserable d artagnan he is a bold fellow said the cardinal				13.808837034831395
la ramee entered he smiled kindly on the prisoner for he was an excellent man and had taken a great liking for the captive prince				1592.7518720881615
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word				101.50650748160028
then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men were heard and the queen herself raised the tapestry hangings and put her finger on her lips				29.206521769997057

he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the door of his study opened				469.6900018191352

villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head				121.90612318983987

now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example not at all plainly enough messrs thomson french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so by what right sir by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive once more danglars bit his lips				190.03986532374398
the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville				852.0416107391662
gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him				4.896320132605972

yes you are right i am but a poor friend to you				7.964584816823307
the watchword is king and ré saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendant for that night he himself slept in the camp				289.4573174237933
alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words				383.4578543035735
my dear fellow don t speak like that of monsieur groslow				200.92195052326525
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation				10429.242590546664
the poorly fastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts and i found myself in the house				46.40620133423806
madame de saint méran a gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of m de villefort				3.7639597205251674
after breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attention whilst d artagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of aramis				402.59496365239636
from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a mark the trunk of some old and moss grown olive tree that grew on the sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand				1817.1453304783904
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber the two travelers consulted for a moment				262.3598226352208
well asked the duke when they were alone				664.5234502122308
his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him				2.717228564075672
has he taken off his doublet on the contrary everything is in the kitchen				744.2469302115569

tomorrow said he you will be avenged or i shall be dead no said she you will avenge me but you will not be dead				814.5445228565668
but i could find nothing absolutely nothing				304.17340848520985
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him				2.2747657096279843
i was saying it was very interesting what was all you were showing me				3.5488559542809637
there was a crowd on the pier				24747.951415228436
d artagnan remained standing and examined this man				233.18448240933097
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt				3355.9309660557064
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure three curates remained those of st merri st sulpice and st eustache				3659.3190187485848

the carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the step to embrace me a last time my brother s servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop but d artagnan				1.0082995891767412
will you go away from here demanded the swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry				7013.624502225898
this plan succeeded and signor pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert when morcerf himself appeared				20.90128535880995
at last after crossing the courts of the palais royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate				365.60835447767425
at this moment the door opened and madame de chevreuse was announced				271.28616132092475
as villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brother in law is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of 1814 and we can not molest napoleon without breaking those compacts oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m de salvieux				699.5151012500563
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed the young man is right let the prisoner be brought in meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was				270.4063952260514
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for d artagnan s embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that i know you with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent king you my dear porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as d artagnan porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right athos arose				415.89336214952345
madame said debray it is nearly six months since we have been associated				4900.279015010185
battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal				1413.7231950986393
twas too brief an enjoyment and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life				1110.1685312451152
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start				6025.10132229161
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could				1082.2921513074182
ah m andrea said the latter with his half jesting tone how do you do charmingly as you see				58.189086207290835
two hours passed away without anything fresh happening				15718.593085476685
this son is named andrea cavalcanti				472.96318991143613
sir what gratitude i feel exclaimed the man with gray hair				1888.8961728634101
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant				2538.25583438209
dantès saw that he must attack the wedge				16749.78959952863
without doubt he recognized d artagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head				25.66072822570994
do you think he died a natural death a sort of smile was discernible on the motionless lips of noirtier				73.18536379951031
parry odious as was this sight to him sought for those among some eight or ten workmen who were making the most noise and fixed on two men who were loosening the last hooks of the iron balcony				1283.1521262042568
at the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written mirame a tragedy in five acts and raised his head				97.48379556481756
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half scared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person				714.8501803659085
no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hands into his pockets				23547.98066646277
the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise d artagnan had made and opening the door said come in all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that d artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard				428.61998772062884
on his account i add two hundred crowns scoundrel muttered d artagnan				1.0045896766439621
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head				35.49792415539941
who sends you no one how did you know i was in prison i recognized you some time since as the insolent dandy who so gracefully mounted his horse in the champs élysées oh the champs élysées				53.174219588480234
have you it asked raoul yes that is i had it repined the gascon making believe to find it				5.626643453198879
you were right sir said anne				521.990766239098
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror				2479.1261801555947
i was sure of it the cursed letter don t be afraid you idiot there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed d artagnan i will go without you				11.588957883766659
three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds				22157.93449337677
having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps				2473.40414587272
i would then rather die truly murmured valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not				72.00999465329046
however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover what relics are those by which you swear asked mazarin smiling				19.974444242148365
brave rash and enterprising this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts				39874.39417672816
then turning to noirtier do you hope the assassin will be tried no then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine yes it is no news to you added d avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject				89.3597233814686
why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me				7.428678383102669
then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle m policar morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon				4024.0343380514546
it was in this pavilion on the ground floor that d artagnan and porthos were confined suffering interminable hours of imprisonment in a manner suitable to each different temperament				4828.210302214495
at least d artagnan said to himself as he took the road to villars cotterets at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking				10187.416272024464
all right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it so				85.19855179973845
did you bet oh merely a paltry fifty louis and who was the winner nautilus				55116.472295682026
her will be done like that of god in all things then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to part				11572.18302090704
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage				358.68322356434214
not at all my young man				11.925621987863188
laporte could not leave the louvre she had not a soul in the world in whom she could confide				10918.500890008594
the spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination				4402.945173289313
so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eyes but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another man s fortune				568.761684095799
sheathe then if you please and follow us monsieur said aramis parodying jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves but unfortunately the thing is impossible monsieur de tréville has forbidden it				15.872572942082982
my lord said d artagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinary that is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin he fell into meditation				27584.17507574454
but to her great surprise d artagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better when will you do that immediately i hope ah				73.13540763597179
as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone				649.1192571604715
the crisis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on one knee				426.47201979991377
then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch from which each took a concealed musket the result was that our seven travelers were outnumbered in weapons				971.6113133145066
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence				11551.718147896285
still silent valentine had promised not to wake				56444.29612331349
i stumbled over some object i stooped to examine it was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet				3528.9058117869545
i am lost murmured she i am lost				340.64928633884807
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless				14802.45906873473
he commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded				3337.9510833844593
you are certainly an extraordinary man said danglars and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich and to have ideas added madame danglars				5.019905898080302
27 and stopped in the yard				4557.558885605516
his heart beat but not like d artagnan s with a young and impatient love				802.2558089223345
ah he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw				5611.573717248531
my dear m de villefort replied the doctor with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young man i have not led you here to console you on the contrary what can you mean asked the procureur alarmed				615.5354282734863
pardieu mute as a carp well i think andrea stopped and looked around				159.32037778053504
d artagnan bent down to his horse s neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat				931.0782176611204
it restores the blue color of litmus paper reddened by an acid and it turns syrup of violets green				10878.361031009277
are you there now certes replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle the fingers resumed the jesuit st				1109.653574086611
tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given				893.3569740865479
what must come is written monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening quite the contrary planchet the more ill will i have toward monsieur bonacieux the more punctual i shall be in keeping the appointment made by that letter which makes you so uneasy then that is monsieur s determination undeniably my friend				34.04922377516047
where he was no one knew				1734.0231381251633
20029m as to the note which accompanied this the englishman understood that it might have been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in dantès situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt				3729.998294577476
you knew the poor lad then continued caderousse				58.81938477942712
athos invited d artagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine o clock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve				30058.125129046315
his dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold itself and he will deliver the official order to the officer who in his turn will hand it to the executioner in the meantime it will be as well to acquaint peppino with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses because in either case a very useless expense will have been incurred your excellency said the man you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not nay i flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it replied the cavalier in the cloak				107.42158616284027
this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m de boville the inspector of prisons no				132.84905541407142
many small donations 1 to 5 000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs				1557.4167916312185
well said maximilian death came a third time and neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word				78.07514322885599
but i say no more madame it is really as if i were prescribing for you the clock struck half past six and a lady was announced a friend of madame de villefort who came to dine with her				12.225475364791736
do you know that i was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the bastille oh a day and night soon pass away				120.12819170450597
lead two sheep to the butcher s two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make one of them understand that his companion will not die the sheep will bleat for pleasure the ox will bellow with joy				186.18642682173117
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded				652.4520736518363
at the first glance and by the joy which was painted on his countenance the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot				690.5029691410556
in spite of his repugnance to address the guards dantès turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand comrade said he i adjure you as a christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going				144.84153705582568
think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of us along the wall sir said mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves the three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace				3490.8476192988264
i shall obey the wishes of the people				167.0077276732804
you are right sir said athos				7.431798006589406
the blow so they tell me at least was struck with a master s hand mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain				3507.9612191685624
ah my dear father said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you how do you do my dear son said the major gravely				50.78518485273432
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave d artagnan uneasiness				366.4987230253881
you will give me a copy this evening which i shall know by heart tomorrow d artagnan looked at his friends as if to say well what did i tell you now continued he addressing planchet you have eight days to get an interview with lord de winter you have eight days to return in all sixteen days				911.4787174666704
in that case i will forgive him and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him				4.416706309349701
yes i know that said d artagnan and you mentioned it to me but who knows what has become of him				21.366928915242063
at the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her				15.414798029716328
a private room had been prepared for the king and another for monsieur				822.3835076029991
have pity on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself as dantès his eyes turned in the direction of the château d if uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey and with his sailor s eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan				35319.17583410568
who the beggar was that i killed ah				1646.1534357510764

monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenances nothing was omitted go on go on said d artagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come				228.56657970707926
so now you are both forewarned the young men bowed and quitted the box				3370.0168881959776
i have another commission for you m bertuccio said he i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandy for instance between le havre and boulogne				1721.0154361671873

you shall shut the door that you may be certain i contemplate no injury to you				6.380825463620922
the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend				15202.428626142893
d artagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others				2810.644967895982
the queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of the fête to the pleasure she had experienced in the ballet and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen whether she smile or weep everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of the city of paris				179.14562870786983

at last after renewed hesitation dantès entered the second grotto				1191.2209969926307
she had raised her veil and with her face hidden by her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long restrained by the presence of her son				367.248511202708
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and i can not fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you and as a proof of what i say here is mine in my pocket so saying he pulled out his own handkerchief likewise a very elegant handkerchief and of fine cambric though cambric was dear at the period but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms only ornamented with a single cipher that of its proprietor				9073.621572518525
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him but men are changed by events there is nothing truer than that said porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine				1275.4640467088905
dantès approached the upper rock which now without any support leaned towards the sea				96.67020866115043
of aramis yes since he has become an abbé				1219.3624182116853
the sentinel opened the door it was a new face				481.80838868265994
the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened				291.42835556738345
do you talk of a sacrifice i do do you then suspect anyone i suspect no one death raps at your door it enters it goes not blindfolded but circumspectly from room to room				2721.1987569733774
he heard hasty steps the creaking of a door people going and coming and some minutes afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted there was a moment s silence and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where dantès was listening in horror				5610.2734257848915
and you shall be alone replied the young man				1.148998505939626
that which i had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as though it had been the result of calculation				961.9002831172
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services the two young men bowed				175.67351819416263
now said d artagnan i ve one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges at your service sir you will see the count again to morrow morning will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained you want the cardinal to come here no i know my place and am not so presumptuous				32706.293485019316
all s well he cried as he entered i have hired a cedar wherry as light as a canoe as easy on the wing as any swallow				20019.20927912485
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers				191.7296581758172
i place no confidence in their hypocritical faces				52585.283283654084
ah yes that is the name certainly				1898.9421338929426
oh if she betrayed your majesty on the side of your honor it would be quite another thing and i should be the first to say no grace sire no grace for the guilty happily there is nothing of the kind and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are but the queen not the less deserves all my anger it is you sire who have now incurred hers				31789.880824245727
monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl s arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child				1005.320922753262
a great pity said monte cristo				1.007561445211635
thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark				3416.792222381344
m danglars is my banker m de villefort has overwhelmed me with politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune enabled me to render him				6.3352327687953665
there do you hear observed gaetano he is bidding you adieu the young man took his carbine and fired it in the air but without any idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore				240.50224758430693

as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in				354.11619422548756
notwithstanding all the pains he took d artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new made friends				142.60753679065462
that is my name said athos quietly				914.63783241579
a presentiment instantly told d artagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently				1271.8498464015704
it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette				235.96896555541133
tell me about it said the monk who sitting on the foot of the bed began to be interested in a story so strangely introduced				4163.936241836579
is that all then in truth my dear chevalier you are a miracle of memory				2469.084202046658
that is impossible replied the governor				34.82091128531303
have you really no desire to meet him none whatever replied eugénie				234.3065334144918
you have forgotten it porthos said he				4.397528782169729
whilst they pursue him the king might escape it is good advice said athos and if the king will do one of us the honor we shall be truly grateful to him what do you think of this counsel winter asked the king looking with admiration at these two men whose chief idea seemed to be how they could take on their shoulders all the dangers that assailed him				2.8798310476538336
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand				7.160655910828991
madame say that you would love me then				88.3305279080903
it was planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of piedmont				15900.769930912309
d artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him				3.5599836761802615
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all d artagnan blushed				16.53492019063962
the soubrette said for your master i have no other master but you so a pretty little lass my faith is that soubrette d artagnan opened the letter and read these words a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest				562.870070291342
ah my friend said he it is all the better if you are in difficulties how is it all the better yes for his eminence will give you all that you want land money and titles ah				103.70536801893265
i think this is about your position is it not confound it yes replied danglars				60.17687436278294
now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of your eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that i may not commit an error there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors				173211.92402732043
so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth and yet said d artagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make sorties and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans				28067.95903582242
they told ten other stories of this bandit chief each more singular than the other				119.37359555560263
it is not mercy then that you are about to accord sire it is justice and he is in the fort l evêque said the king				13.4013795946081
they reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have been				2073.2906680150345
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error well then if it be so are you ready albert perfectly let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy yes let us do so the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said i signori francesi the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter				275.9909302723708
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambition fernand and danglars how was this jealousy manifested				42707.35963419435
athos wounded anew by cahusac became evidently paler but did not give way a foot				2336.994272961343
you say you desire my mother s good opinion i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent 30111m do you think so said monte cristo with interest				2289.003369151898
what have we all done then dear grandpapa said valentine you no longer seem to love any of us the old man s eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness				27713.509835410532
the work of revolt continued the whole night thus				15202.617103465702
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression				953.4226577029402
i see how it will be said athos we shall get into some pretty quarrel or other and we have no need of one just now				469.81319907844977
in that case i should beat a retreat				383.3110563061711
i do not feel remorse because that woman i profoundly hold deserved her punishment				4748.5621821426275
friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that shall i take out any more of them asked porthos				8.515245122929704
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point				3864.3624857839654
did you ever hear of such an idea monte cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his face				43.56010848273908
milady de boulogne evening of the twenty fifth				2747.491739741021
it is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good say not so quickly returned monte cristo say not so my friends angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to be				553.1704593222925
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven				193.581649865316
are the carbines loaded yes brigadier well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd				881.116557474317
but you sent for me my dear child				159.7511004015203
why should an exception be made in her favor i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception it is true but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come carlini s teeth clenched convulsively				1715.3254895352288
one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue férou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abbé busoni were within				1009.8516017138002
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed				1229.5244453823418
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant i shall borrow from the queen but her majesty has no property interposed aramis				444.05744795356435
then one could enjoy charming little dinners where one touches on one side the hand of a friend and on the other the foot of a mistress				848.522748727527
i content myself with saying command monseigneur i am ready your pardon said richelieu surprised				352.9688247417149
it was warm work we were in a place where it was not very cold replied porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him				3.7115015824074664
who goes there was asked a second time				136.0456607325613
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over				370.90501544732365
i am well i want nothing do not call him she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room				18.542606256282447
well i who am a bonapartist also declare one thing to you which is that i will kill you				2.7851142412793637
mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle				5092.899377042069
mistrust porthos especially who to please the count whom he regards as god on earth will assist him in contriving mazarin s escape if mazarin has the wit to weep or play the chivalric aramis smiled his smile was at once cunning and resolute				6289.521070516753
but could i do with a million retorted the count				12.29567166150146
but to resume my story i turned towards my grandfather as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading				3654.7049266865233
yes but when once they are hamstrung our necks will be strung next if one of them comes to my side asked porthos must i kill him yes by a blow of your fist if you can we will not fire but at the last extremity i can do it said porthos				10.025230554988335
the devil take this gout cried monsieur de bouillon evidently ill at ease				3771.3830399313483
in a moment thanks to her habit of conversing with her grandfather she understood that he asked for a key				521.4029359203256
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length				23.233740733848112
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen				127120.23876893171
d artagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money				144.68125495553664
now since the affair of nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one				571.7585208176955
at this moment a patrol passed by				22781.92819221932
i do not madame rejoined mazarin				51.697986488197216
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her				8.62000886395463
bonacieux the one he had just picked up				360.33646894058097
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the english				548.1160767667914
he sent us home in his own carriage				360.1621119923551
in front of them the lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin while on the other side was a black mass of trees profiled on a stormy sky invaded by large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night				212.48845817617237
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber				75.07854641691297
two hours after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded				16875.622635647327
besides whether at home or not whether in paris or cairo the abbé always left something to give away which the valet distributed through this wicket in his master s name				232.9216638537168
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands				45.04743885218187
it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand tréville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel				214.86468730572264
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom				1074.5432582970993
eight days after i was back again madame				379.8967269425304
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated				4507.108700015661
when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are				89.7350944174781
you are too charming said d artagnan sorrowfully and you abuse my love no i use your generosity that s all				199.90342928511882
you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairs on the expulsion of don carlos				60926.507989624646
let him pass d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard				922.4749514310208
well is all said all then let s count our money and divide it				8.812950825834056
are they both dead asked lord de winter sternly				1160.8088990622764
the two friends as we see were worthy of and understood one another				139.96039923073226
it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices				9255.662793620706
it was a mistake yes which made fools laugh which caused the minister to have a sleepless night which has caused the minister s secretaries to blacken several sheets of paper but which has cost me 700 000 francs but sir said hermine suddenly if all this is as you say caused by m debray why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it				6.280802948767338
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy				11870.607653995854
the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands				921.1576015629702
mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him				11.027751327287366
de salvieux my brother s chamberlain yes sire he is at marseilles and writes me thence does he speak to you of this conspiracy no but strongly recommends m de villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty m				680.1465907770303
anne de bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven				115.59993821351036
they separated and d artagnan rushed between them like a dart				11832.066790661363
you are the directors of all consciences				7903.179363982266
but danglars had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the posting master				1579.1050366223665
each person s attention was occupied				5924.205773788999
as to porthos that is certainly droll but i am not the less a giddy fool				19089.259798508905
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us				97.23588731954281
i do not remember if it is exactly 48 000 francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference				890.756714483055
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project				14982.045717137751
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty				645.4014166884698
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any ill feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties your father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them				14.166170077885411
i shall meet with a victim				6047.661968473661
you think then as i do that she deceives me said the king				30.27273056383134
two royal pages were playing with him				21.5087585384104
i like a favorable reception it expands the countenance and those around me do not then appear so ugly				8510.281535775885
i have not yet had time to see him again				90.41979329417768
la ramee i recommend monsieur le duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an instant la ramee became therefore the duke s dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper the shadow of his person but la ramee gay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the duke s eyes his incorruptibility				28051.18070999186
it happened that on this particular night the minister s box was placed at the disposal of lucien debray who offered it to the comte de morcerf who again upon his rejection of it by mercédès sent it to danglars with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening in the event of their accepting the box in question				1401.968568736954
go from hence to blangy and from blangy to neufchâtel				3675.372304068085
leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me monsieur said athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance d artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athos s last remark he stopped short				6391.735559364543
with his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter				29711.847395651297
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal 100 000 francs which i spent in four or five months it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in paris amongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just now it was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place				682.9264824833348
in the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the king s window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it ah cried aramis that accounts for the cry i heard probably said d artagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to whitehall with three of his friends				62.68272191583151
gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the two prisoners whom i can not leave				1487.791357594803
but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice				1255.555095839057
through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind not of the woman but of the poet				8781.373145923033
luckily for the rascal for i should have left him dead on the spot i assure you and what has became of him oh i don t know he had enough and set off without waiting for the rest				253.98793310333892
as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port				525.6053709825575
thus for instance don t you in the first place want a horse yes a horse well then				302.56756022846986
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away				49.530817082457204
besides i have promised him your patronage you are right said the duke				12.334261012709614

for a half league they proceeded thus the cannon shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls				167.1099312672618

the procurator s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse				139.19719937499045
but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips				34.56376607617855

the queen was ignorant where the mercer s young wife was but had promised to have her sought for but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure d artagnan				1.0062421558092791
so much the better said d artagnan				1.0055011509004756

above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre eminence				1157.943011472008
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill joined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars				1451.0402218581667

his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers				31034.698859215205
the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman				11354.678920029492
paris is not paved with cambric monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said d artagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions				7500.605494987263
beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the box of pistols from the carriage				270.3265932571333

sir said the servant i have a favour to ask you speak out my friend i am afraid to do so				10.497803133616655
it was a masonic sign caderousse had taught him				6.570308906936416
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her albert shook his head and looked thoughtful				4814.558758495171
the procureur went out after having double locked the door				12.785350558052404
they obtained information at ablain and a statement of their route was left for grimaud				551.8676422445565
this man except a sword had all the appearance of a soldier and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day				129.91909208443045
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile you are sagacious i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me you				61.01197498262789
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night				788.3862662597581
hi cried the steward the house servants with the carbines on				653.9265480268265

she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water				1785.835784732766
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses				1872.1851641816747
gentlemen said d artagnan you shall have your turn				575.1102754065944
d artagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal				48.87097977548461
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds				1800.5590345176754
by his manner sir and his age he s the second to day has a young man such as i am gone through this morning then asked raoul				93.78318581675401
ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all				1841.3271767777646
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head				37.77081529158041
monsieur d artagnan monsieur du vallon you are free the order was obeyed d artagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle				6088.512097214665
no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain to every argument they replied we must go for death is in this house they all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially mademoiselle valentine so good so kind and so gentle				3567.7463729134975
on whom does my bleeding heart repose				4376.545892834498
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself				63.858129399834
you had your secret and we had ours we didn t exchange them				70.5708765602694
a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror				195.59911967029788
unquestionably edmond s star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girl he will be captain too and laugh at us all unless a sinister smile passed over danglars lips unless i take a hand in the affair he added				1874.3056991643077
i retained my harness by instinct				45710.63789999499
tis you la ramee in faith tis time you came back again				210.11666534525264
as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the café de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted				13035.596303463728
yes the sheep are fed in my meadows which are excellent pasture give me another cutlet no try this hare which i had killed yesterday in one of my warrens zounds				7579.415004254651
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all i tell you madame i do not ask you to tell me said mazarin astounded by this returning courage				6265.185772264475
since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman i presume that she has returned to tours to tours				3775.741124775748
god bless his majesty yes repeated the leader in a whisper god bless his majesty and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn				82.98708218939119
we must proceed in an orderly manner hush said grimaud he is coming out				206.4887582970369
i suppose the count has the tastes of the day to be sure returned monte cristo it is very convenient then it is more it is magnificent peste let us not lose such an opportunity returned monte cristo				1.0135698320897675
but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle				10211.802113456748
well cried the three musketeers all together on seeing d artagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger				609.5358659441127
you told me that what matters it to you kitty				801.2862601743944
they entered behind a glass window by the light of the cardinal s lantern which had been placed on the floor in the midst of the gallery they saw the orange and pomegranate trees of the castle of rueil in long lines forming one great alley and two smaller side alleys				4718.38940964844
but you say you do not wish to kill me no and yet you will let me perish with hunger ah that is a different thing well then wretches cried danglars i will defy your infamous calculations i would rather die at once				60.780429661979085
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear monsieur does me wrong said planchet i thought he had seen me at work yes but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left only i beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening i hope so monsieur well then i count on you at the appointed hour i shall be ready only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said d artagnan and nodding to planchet he went out				26.951758555376212
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of 100 000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality by the way m de château renaud asked beauchamp how is morrel ma foi i have called three times without once seeing him				191.42043814920993
now said monte cristo that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear m cavalcanti to meet your lost andrea saying which monte cristo bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the count				40.67140069553125
but the words you have just spoken the hope you have almost given me will have richly paid all were it my life oh but i said anne i also duke have had presentiments i also have had dreams				4413.33728609082
he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body agitated by feverish shudders				11820.968603634397
is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward athos was seized with a kind of vertigo				20190.15757226226
leave me then to act and have no fears for the result at least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should fail none whatever				734.0716109489169
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground				1288.9287607107551
i wish to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish satan bowed his head and groaned				1036.472831842922
he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged				1811.079701896063
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows				314.0648385493666
excuse me said d artagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him				2.341625477960781
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raoul s departure				698.3279875155321
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s mousetrap which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned d artagnan				1.0093827248892313
pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer				324.4366154175949
why here they give you their hand they press yours in return they keep up a whispering conversation permit you to accompany them home				572.9369745976295
first my stranger of meung then de wardes to whom i have given three sword wounds next milady whose secret i have discovered finally the cardinal whose vengeance i have balked well said athos that only makes four and we are four one for one				98.88833454030437
the latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the corks and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat				7265.164746182893
are you going added she to comminges				1896.766592306406
when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol				10733.531760402186
my mother inherited an estate from her husband you have assassinated her my name would have secured me the paternal estate you have deprived me of it you have despoiled me of my fortune				361.87031301594783
then he added in a low tone yes that is the haven and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears				1108.1185896021452
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe i ought rather to say what i know what you know and even what i am sure of and of what are you so sure i would say that i know this great lady you yes i and how do you know her oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion speak				2266.785636406309
but this last circumstance was not striking as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much				1635.5891240121205
unlimited credit about two o clock the following day a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english horses stopped at the door of monte cristo and a person dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive gold chain brown trousers and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his features a person in a word who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the carriage door on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron and directed his groom to inquire at the porter s lodge whether the count of monte cristo resided there and if he were within				1388.6023129103853
this is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age				2771.928443206135
the young men first approached the dead man				2.0318139036652347
at nine o clock the next morning the drums beat to arms				936.5591466355157
the jailer came in the evening				147.0478350281536
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock				1468.0746199032803
good thought he mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him				16.356256755776663
in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money				972.0812134895492
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory				693.0171356466002
anne of austria opened the door to him herself				194.4224481782354
mazarin leaned out of the window				38.21349459888021
alas to many the path is traced by tears sir said madame danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not				20.280019975577947
at every step that edmond took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag				1952.022966326977
the count hastily descended presented himself at the already opened carriage door and held out his hand to a young woman completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold				157.06267296212837
this time it was mordaunt who smiled				1873.9875552254425
for ever and ever cried the youth oh				2193.2046178803926
therefore when i cough stretch out your arm good the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window				97.42700879013873
encouraged by this discovery edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer				16772.039956149783
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with you are either cowards or traitors the eyes of the scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king				30.48110144573257
villefort looked at valentine as they said this				713.9978393526449
dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed				1739.7344577615918
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that d artagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place				245.53123459462384
monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time pistache s patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth				377.33490123589013

you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient				1268.3613993130277
and with his lackey he took the road to the governor s country house				288.30119694734424
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory				748.7351490742014
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath				122230.17100922162
they passed to the third story it was the telegraph room				395.39455811068467

tis well said porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from aramis so there is said d artagnan and he read we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it confound it interrupted porthos with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room are they in danger of dying d artagnan continued athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge				2561.779303375044
the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amélie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty francs				2832.701286201001
i take them said d artagnan for myself				610.6678323509525

i repeat to you i don t know her why she is the old wife of a procurator of the châtelet monsieur named madame coquenard who although she is at least fifty still gives herself jealous airs				179355.99603406398

30169m notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired				841.079257769865
he embraced juxon and pressed the hand of aramis				56.01569417530657
listen attentively alas stammered villefort i do not lose a single word m				149.8687487851339
yes monsieur replied the terrified citizen in a tone so low that he was scarcely audible				5548.254809187763
i love to see you thus				116.32385724014473
ah pardieu said beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend i need not tell you the cause of my visit are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial paper				1660.596660783576
if my vote and interest can obtain it for him i will readily give him the one and promise the other				82.99915232103554
already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by debray				1320.261394315775
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes				39.93066271665902
you who are in power have only the means that money produces we who are in expectation have those which devotion prompts devotion said villefort with a sneer				124174.90949598589
then if he persists notwithstanding all this as that is as i have said the limit of my mission i shall have nothing to do but to pray god to work a miracle for the salvation of france				52.64975950086858
i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon				232.56597013753114

be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing				3817.2074445420685
poor dear man he is innocence itself and something like a faint smile lighted the still terrified features of the young woman				182.9837435762732
d artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised				55012.390502336566
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way				158.18097305043548
porthos has perhaps sixty thousand francs income				6554.646948780278

she was obliged to pass between the point of the jetty surmounted by a beacon just lighted and a rock which jutted out				409.4252288740393
release broussel she cried never at this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the door				5.8574969355942805
i practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world				84.5491168640414

oh said dantès timidly what is the matter villefort made no answer but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the letter				96.56567351684738
30301m meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf who standing before a mantle piece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a looking glass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him				7.252311618337312
well in my turn i advise you to keep a sharp lookout on your treasure my dear monsieur groslow for i can tell you we shall not leave this without robbing you of it not without my defending it said groslow				2286.3864012682434
my father is king s attorney replied andrea calmly				27.154868497176025
no matter observed caderousse replacing the box in his pocket someone else will purchase it yes continued the jeweller but someone else will not be so easy as i am or content himself with the same story				300.9841110191255
yes said she it is madame danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us				103.99704129456788
how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven and very soon they left the inn				598.8313187897713
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on				279.2982897899778
étienne soon returned from his errand				89552.66514528994
the prisoner glanced at the windows they were grated he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither				5788.263258344022
having been brought up on the banks of the loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum across				40203.501220212675
i am a man of order sir let us do things in order nevertheless replied mordaunt i could compel you i command here ah sir said d artagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us				118.84562185148997
he remembered the count of monte cristo				1.0173466196562226
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself				167.43064890259683
on no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although i during his absence watched in his place yes i know it said the soldier				175.8792882196985
but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter				8274.778922055897
caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect				51267.7491314397
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself				4241.335505135764
the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies				6005.367523448203
three of the four horses had already arrived				4650.601009117212
this is what i shall do i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned				4793.506879110628
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet				82795.11460211083
we are lost said d artagnan in the ear of athos				21.53042022499724
valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed				3180.0720051676244
a rich englishman continued the abbé who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value this jewel he bestowed on dantès upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement				7161.476970445517
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from her yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too late perhaps silence laporte you may be overheard				2931.381698493351
waiting for whom bertuccio without answering pointed to villefort with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo				28271.000117139032
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table				37.70438790799757
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him				9.625393608354202

m de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin				11685.400754869723
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii				4649.106600777922

the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as wasilio s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen				27224.954239349474
the two friends turned down the first street they came to				1086.3183140012009

the blood no longer flowed from his wounds				24759.235497132995
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still remain and you have returned have you not replied m bonacieux giving to his countenance a most sly air				31.578168483215876
on leaving paris athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger				2633.4536166003486
ah yes mazarin bit his lips as he spoke i know your devotion to her majesty i have been a captain in the queen s guards for twenty years was the reply				673.5850376611381
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so then make yourself quite easy				207.7461833855111
he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower stands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the mantle piece the countess s smelling bottle taken from its shagreen case and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness as he entered my dear mother have you been ill during my absence no no albert but you know these roses tuberoses and orange flowers throw out at first before one is used to them such violent perfumes then my dear mother said albert putting his hand to the bell they must be taken into the antechamber				475.20797762892107
between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged				3920.9671642615617
but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic beauchamp i yes you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valentine ah yes so i was				577.8283033671639
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances				571544.0515962436
but where is my old friend winter the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence				369.2309218045547

dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress got in by his side				181.53239732545666
after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair 0193m who talks of god and despair at the same time said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man s ears				618.5120446730125
had i been as great a friend of jonah as i am of d artagnan i should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself and you would have done the same aramis certainly but you make me out better than i am dear count				185.23642042828905
it was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to arrive				2172.5869050034885
come along athos come along cried d artagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed but athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by his				1547.6772773749626
where is your master you monsieur d artagnan cried grimaud impossible grimaud said athos coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown grimaud i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak ah monsieur it is silence grimaud contented himself with pointing d artagnan out to his master with his finger				250.6090888092324

for god s sake tell me did you know this englishman but you tell me also that the house of thomson french have constantly denied having rendered you this service yes then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your father had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation everything is possible in this affair even a miracle what was his name asked monte cristo				1.0054550170141276

formerly a brewer replied the gascon				56.968342997341686
athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder				198.0698992909409
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse				5311.917947059282
ah gentlemen you want battle and you shall have it good god cried the hollow voice of athos i can hear d artagnan i think yes cried d artagnan raising his voice in turn i am here my friend ah good then replied athos we will teach them these door breakers the gentlemen had drawn their swords but they found themselves taken between two fires				293712.5440760771

dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement				3872.9514958082295
well my dear dantès are you now free inquired the owner				3742.333685534259

my children two of them at least the duke of york and the princess elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes my husband the king is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired				1921.203501379599

without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that d artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos				1623.1619202901802
may i hope sir said madame de villefort that your intentions accord with my request noirtier made a sign that they did				513.3974201410094

planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of d artagnan and which d artagnan from that time made shift to do without				44088.214995222006
ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may to be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said aramis				14.88384467633566
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind				46.00149240588885
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity				3115.8169920792566
you have told me the truth my gentlemen said he addressing the musketeers and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you				9.51657096984034

were i but of gentle birth the position of the cardinal was indeed critical and recent events had added to his difficulties				2161.431309864185
then why did you smile why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine do you want me to go away ah no no				772.6477006758581
no d artagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time				1916.7344689548727
he was wrong to leave it there but the jailer was wrong not to have looked before him				5.545735563098017
although the cardinal was often tormented by fear he was more often in need of counsel and information and he was therefore sufficiently accessible				11470.504341987807
now of two hundred and fifty one members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninety one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon				5184.321830609117

at the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads				672.7228725551978
30023m m de villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist				7710.853339575727

then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan andrea had left him				2.975462543466782
then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity				1135.7683909240054
this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone				800.6629431787892
as our fugitives approached the house they found the ground cut up as if a considerable body of horsemen had preceded them				7.369783742928611
but you don t know us when we can t have one thing we invent another and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody only to our host				557.8007328936945

d artagnan on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the guards with strict orders that great care should be taken of it and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday d artagnan sent planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment				41465.53795191235

athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it				12.924656808694833
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain				1823.5981910717428

our four friends in particular astonished their comrades they traveled together side by side with sad eyes and heads lowered				73760.88317482467
la chesnaye go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you can find forty pistoles and if you can find them bring them to me				7.962819030948256

porthos instead of returning directly home d artagnan alighted at the door of m de tréville and ran quickly up the stairs				140.34935571236136
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès				666.9344370173814
on hearing the sound of his footsteps the two men threw themselves in each other s arms and while they were in the midst of this embrace the count entered				69.82483854162372
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word				64.56627298574983
the victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four men				1814.0338595847584
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head				85.35347691978082
the latter recollected the terrible caution of monte cristo she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife				966.5136034737973
if we had only been looking for porthos porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him				6.014039835252522
and what has happened to you my dear porthos continued d artagnan				1.0094624762275088

impossible they appear to be numerous then tis something else another horse said porthos				11.322743069291507

morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing noirtier upstairs				3154.608391599421
it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form				1442.2726423164158
cavalcanti continued danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million livres that is admirable said eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other				51.75000269656067
no monsieur it is not aramis and by your exclamation i perceive you have mistaken me for another and pardon you you pardon me cried d artagnan				1.0101226565732881
anne questioned d artagnan by a look				306.6203251132709

orders had just been given to the royal guards and the swiss guards not only to stand firm but to send out patrols to the streets of saint denis and saint martin where the people thronged and where they were the most vociferous when the mayor of paris was announced at the palais royal				3.3905582783514854
i never caution my servants a second time remember that baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door				7.7684082037283675
i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty oh a letter				154.73584490368216

no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity				28857.83560607265

these important advantages d artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe				11395.652539975847
there only they explained to them the matter in hand				637.4979124904537

you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variétés i purchased mine at constantinople it cost me more but i have nothing to fear but you forget replied debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free who will tell her the first person who sees her she only speaks romaic that is different but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes oh no replied monte cristo i do not carry brutalism so far				1385.8591431475204

the only thing that astonished d artagnan was that his friends had never thought of this				785.4609421280836
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house so that since that time replied d artagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host				286.22012122875395

when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dantès				636.9880335443042
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance				3936.3509356306486
the life of the four young men had become fraternal				10237.046846820092

the young man prepared for this scene by the state of his own feelings which were mournful and by the majesty of the cathedral which he had passed through descended in a slow and solemn manner and stood with head uncovered before these mortal spoils of the last king who was not to be placed by the side of his forefathers until his successor should take his place there and who appeared to abide on that spot that he might thus address human pride so sure to be exalted by the glories of a throne dust of the earth				311.1757533359621
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor				425.54246944879554

the visitor either understood the abbé s meaning or had no more questions to ask he arose and the abbé accompanied him to the door				16.022881763447195

in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio whose servant he had been another the illustrious mazarin acting the part of ignatius loyola in a tragedy of that name a third the illustrious mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny who had expected to have it a fourth the illustrious coxcomb mazarin refusing to give laporte the young king s valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner				637.7396245432283
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words				361.0340525976848
but you expected some one then asked the officer				89.77669499201501
i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron s banking establishment i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it and further that he stated to m danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions				1933.4890571337778
on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the hôtel de londres				137.69626189532644
do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin				25.78373070078781
answer in your turn or you may repent of your disobedience king s musketeers said athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so				15.290438338393395
upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressing gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar				5601.991815438927
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir				39.159594177014654
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king				34.26092197033915
he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pères where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess				389.8916772450575

four hours later he was in neufchâtel				10943.958320496322
he was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at villeroy				436.05455956250324
dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it				10.6377319750195
on the contrary i think they are poor sir they are friends of yours then yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and i would lay down my life for them very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more i will give them to you i will not even ask who they are do as you like with them thank you sir exclaimed mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should i lose it i should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it				17.548137095407768
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear				1792.214209249885
bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret				278.7129129571517
they looked for m danglars but as he was not especially interested in poetical ideas he had gone into the garden and was talking with major cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence				1711.0954674143359
but in either case what is to be done said the young man				1.1384286889338586
and were it not for the windows at the palazzo rospoli by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme i don t know but what i should have held on by my original plan				345.4598020868993
monsieur said athos i have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their custom i have no seconds on my part monsieur said d artagnan for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de tréville to whom i was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his friends athos reflected for an instant				110.12901331435602
i own that this woman terrifies me shall you have the courage said athos				5.835282570256831
it was arranged for the evening and no other time will serve i understand said athos smiling midnight about that time but my dear fellow those are things that bear postponement and you must put it off especially with so good an excuse to give on your return yes if i return if you do not return how does it concern you				3.722182068437051

caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m morrel to aid dantès he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection				96328.6525352518
as soon as lord de winter saw buckingham was dead he ran to felton whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace				245.73421534573276
i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercédès you have had too much already drunkard said danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs i said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i can t keep on my legs				174463.75877072988

did he allude to his hope of being captain he spoke of it as a thing already decided indeed said danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me why it seems m morrel has promised him the thing so that he is quite elated about it why yes he is actually insolent over the matter has already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker which you refused most assuredly although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now m dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance he is about to become a captain pooh said danglars he is not one yet ma foi it will be as well if he is not answered caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to him if we choose replied danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he is what do you mean nothing i was speaking to myself				104.4892889456353

as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed				22982.99865477926
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and that s a comfort can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition i don t know him but as you spoke to him you must have seen him oh it s a description you want exactly so a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman that s the man cried d artagnan again he forever he				519.854321898741

we have before stated that all the servants had fled				9128.70179154851

then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss				3725.29508192115
well madame said de winter when the queen had dismissed her attendants				4069.019037108469
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it				13.077990717716583

monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown				17861.1857977393

with regard to d artagnan we know how he was lodged and we have already made acquaintance with his lackey master planchet				413.9822573657562
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man				1.508670824336606
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned				257.07500862430896

as to that said aramis we are witnesses				4916.062647078448
the clock of the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs élysées and made monte cristo raise his head				23.99294064693621

how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since i shall be obliged to kill you i was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying oh tis a noble gentleman monsieur athos yes true as gospel said d artagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities i remember well said planchet he was fond of drinking in truth he drank but not as other men drink				2318.9137882631717
if i am not saved i shall be avenged you are not a woman said athos coldly and sternly				858.3599034803223
besides you forget cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner				308.25532629038497

but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him				7.56491555752764
the room was neatly comfortably furnished				27077.672314885
when the wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des fossoyeurs that is to say when the forty pistoles of king louis xiii				39.98063699411155
d artagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished				11064.074287285506

in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph				18769.593582979298
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door				3.4694618004730273

the king don carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges and has returned to spain by the catalonian frontier				2824.7592996288445
but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is the king can do no wrong as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france				47.52723202868459
but vampa raised his head proudly as to teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold				428.4610080646303

meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good				922.2396508169379
as edmond passed the door on the fourth floor he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the person in question had got into difficulties and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire				2849.983797779353
and you have a letter yes there it is give it to me then and monte cristo took the letter which he opened and read				1900.430430593459
now d herblay said athos dismount and come here aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached d artagnan				1.008628487608052
we are not such devils as we appear to be				921.8830759209013
my letter is private and confidential and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels				9936.792081547694
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast				1586.6890931340413
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him				7.900906509402261

it bleeds seemingly oh it s nothing said d artagnan				1.004990100740375
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him				7.961008083172251
30197m calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile				48.67205923287484
what have you to say in your defense asked bradshaw of the king				28.178892855515485
but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized captain groslow				817.2012645079594
he was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price				5139.161996454698
at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters				1720.5928563394652
i did not even know that you were the person i was sent to fetch impossible you a favorite of the minister a favorite				6059.866761958697
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table				79.81520396187044
as we were sure of finding him there we left him alone yes said d artagnan you did not really wish to kill you only wished to imprison him good god				409.5339859598349
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you but from whom is that letter oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding grisette from madame de chevreuse s chambermaid perhaps who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress and who in order to appear smart and attractive stole some perfumed paper and sealed her letter with a duchess s coronet what do you say hold				25970.4051670256
you see that i can not like you for instance settle on any fixed plan thou liest subtile one said d artagnan to himself				4.401670546331638
hallo continued caderousse half rising and with his fist on the table hallo edmond				1062.5243971397467
alas sir i never had any opinions				23979.08079373087
d artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding				4994.755789158686
nevertheless you come as one in authority because i happened to be in the ante chamber when the cardinal called me by the merest chance				957.2971144397675
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity				1884.707184650912
but was it my father s ring				1574.917276283873
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count				166.72319381829817
sir said beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from paris at this moment and can not justify himself i accuse no one sir said danglars i relate and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you does the count know what answer you received yes i showed it to him did he know my father s christian name was fernand and his family name mondego yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less				3463.6651115196964
that is right i recommend the cardinal to your attention make your mind easy he is in good hands planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment				263.73881547435496
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m noirtier i resolved to try one last means and for three months i have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains				24976.399687946963
let us alight raoul said athos				6.495313230708463
ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then good bye to the pharaon				355.6820684850007
choose one of us to replace the comte de la fere as long as i don t fight with him it is the same to me with whom i fight				6019.622146058226

lord de winter was not at home and it was milady who this time did all the honors of the evening				150.88178634528907
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them				9.634616527675584
d artagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward ah yes said a light horseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly				3868.5291683723217
d artagnan looked attentively at the building				3400.5222552163536
sir said he do you suppose for a moment that a man can sustain a physical shock such as m noirtier has received without any detriment to his mental faculties it is not exactly that sir said the notary which makes me uneasy but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions so as to be able to get his answers you must see that to be an utter impossibility said villefort				38.16268099868356
i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds well said aramis what do you say to that i say my dear d herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan the division being made by the light of bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis				33.52559955481761
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders				14.564602701128015
tréville added the king in a low voice as the others were retiring as you have no room in the musketeers and as we have besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that corps place this young man in the company of the guards of monsieur dessessart your brother in law				9262.205829165314
m de tréville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become darker				6012.358730750382
on perceiving the count he rose quickly				1096.0047941642408
they will all disappear like the fabrics children build with cards and which fall one by one under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them				42.96666635196182
then some words were spoken by the two women				1876.995993801491
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night				75.66504952426793
a mournful answer awaited each of edmond s eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained				2894.6740260734614
bridle in mouth said d artagnan				1.005187749764186

0295m it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto				1389.6177402976034
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris				101.45279539470022
it was simply yet richly furnished				4207.466383111114
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles				373.6023603660305
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles to lose them even to the gold embroidered belt for gala days win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half a line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and agreeable				3155.1379265827663
what is the use of time rewards of merit medals crosses monthyon prizes if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection				1020.5225391236196

ten minutes after one is taken the effect is produced				4723.7021704252875

sire said villefort the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance and i have profited by that chance like a good and devoted servant that s all				550.3639445566944
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened if conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist if a conqueror he is accused of foul play and want of courage				1543.197531794156
it was evening i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which i in my pride pronounced				10297.834128205277
this reply was too flattering to allow me to insist on his departure				668.384588405941
the same evening the following was read in le messager by telegraph				3952.790133444071

the count soon heard andrea s voice singing a corsican song accompanied by the piano				46585.846356746
i will be an abbé if it suits me				13.855769092225138
i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen				4307.880314747621
above the room in which debray had been dividing two millions and a half with madame danglars was another inhabited by persons who have played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some interest				2028.7270433462697

the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dantès question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port				782.2237666719104
m de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face				80.07102604198245
i can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea				846.4932424638097
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness				4151.846129824399
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england				84.27979130578066

tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed renée you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint méran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past				229.66498634169005
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion baptistin entered and remained standing at the door				5.13861873682627

m de tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline				10821.04866128128
jussac fell like a dead mass				7589.331475956136
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum				12861.78905151543
and why when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed might he not also be				791.4998511929724

you called me didn t you and he fell rather than sat down on one of the seats which surrounded the table				47.90949531840182
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its master s favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish				6930.571441758535

d artagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object				1435.7758988034707
a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man s shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size				3168.1665291296463

there still remained planchet s horse but he stopped short and could not be made to move a step				1013.494707892461

it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary				105785.02800188867
what advantage should i have over you if knowing your secret i were to tell you mine danglars bit his lips				247.9610825437876
are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped				74.17060214395276
after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle field the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself				33.35499024315565
it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two powerful horses				165.1320934380734
athos remained motionless looking after him until he turned the corner of the street				72.03946186214472
indeed the name of bernajoux was known to all the world d artagnan alone excepted perhaps for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not repress				810.8034774089268
i am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you going out or just returned i was going out sir then in order not to hinder you i will get up with you if you please in your carriage and tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow no said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young man s society no i prefer listening to you here my dear m andrea we can chat better in doors and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation the count returned to a small drawing room on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also				650.4190106393874

raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank				5336.2337380848085
he placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace				333.2834534738885
is my father here most undoubtedly replied monte cristo your father major bartolomeo cavalcanti the expression of terror which for the moment had overspread the features of the young man had now disappeared				155.087750481744
the man came straight toward him				1.978075448483741
ah he s gone to blois the poor boy wherefore ah to inquire after the little la valliere she has sprained her foot you know you think he has i am sure of it said athos don t you see that raoul is in love indeed				79.69274848273314

the baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as eugénie used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching heart entered her apartment contiguous as we know to that of eugénie				1477.2455711221248
this lady said the count speaking to ali in the arabic language is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives but the boy refuses saying you are too ugly ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy on whom he gazed without any apparent emotion but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the heart				400.07022369724854
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people s misery				9474.5942829229
when caderousse turned around he saw behind him la carconte paler and trembling more than ever				297.02014730157515
i do not like to disturb those who pray madame said felton seriously do not disturb yourself on my account i beseech you how do you know i was praying sir said milady in a voice broken by sobs				2588.1913247520183

m de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france				112.81754908882513
in a word mademoiselle danglars would make a charming mistress but a wife diable and this said monte cristo is your opinion of your intended spouse yes it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true				75.45870177602833
the bandit s laws are positive a young girl belongs first to him who carries her off then the rest draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings				37949.48134863809
no and you porthos no and you athos no if it was not you it was your purveyor said d artagnan				1.0051212311993085

you are a hundred times too good begone then find them instantly and let all be done tonight				1444.2216070247164
mazarin did not even turn around				680.5371831658579
i am a straightforward simple man that s my great disadvantage				5453.7318948086
those wretches wanted to take away my sword				121.29191132008526
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart				32.76719311529694
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek				4537.950990494199
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men				1046.670672506273
i could not see the expression of his countenance but i felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed				16945.22683229991

i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me athos was more delighted than can be told				20323.822280173965
he having seen them crossing the yard took care not to answer and they rang in vain				636.9813513089521

the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man s face				56.914446732136334
it was then that he encountered for the first time villefort s look that look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his own				125.59957727671905
noirtier s eye was fixed on the dictionary				3589.9071393988233
i am not a banker like m danglars but i am quite as incredulous as he is i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell				569.8999913846388
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love				149.93107746820658
and rally to the old cry of france montjoy and st denis the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors they mounted the king on winter s horse and winter on that of the king then winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with athos on his right and aramis on his left at the head of the second				2777.1344454559735

pardieu cried albert you are not a preacher to remain standing the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning luigi vampa				699.3763562176508
mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it				12.324880753484184
but apropos of debray how is it that i have not seen him lately at the baron s house there has been a misunderstanding what with the baroness no with the baron has he perceived anything ah that is a good joke do you think he suspects said monte cristo with charming artlessness				10030.737662132165
but though he held the cardinal s promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos				930.0829192678282
porthos clapped his hands and the other two came running around				766.808203594821
madame de saintot has hastened to him with broth la renaudot warms his sheets the marquise de rambouillet sends him his tisanes you don t like him my dear parthenie said scarron				2071.7262698452587

i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind and you albert i replied the viscount i saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything				229.7370570695354
it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristo s name announced				292.23964207279636
now where are you going to brussels if you like it is the nearest frontier				11513.597729327756
project gutenberg is a registered trademark				100.91935259082466
after a moment s mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears				1606.1489849164013
the daughter of ali pasha of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki and your slave ma foi yes but how did she become so why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople wonderful				987.704767565117
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth				4746.031379570712
oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly				653.3013432372037
no madame i will not thus waste your time				1132.2438748069014
noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse				1128.0507280704605
d artagnan gave the open letter to kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time				138.87015926352245
if they catch thee thou wilt be hung true replied grimaud				60.55042714263683
answer me without acting as if you were on the stage your interests are concerned in your so doing faith my lord it is very necessary for me to make my fortune your eminence has so long forgotten me we need only a week to amend all that				185.23871696034107
you are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen				869.7307736571822
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the spaniard who had advanced to meet raoul aimed in his turn and raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip				8003.5797998539265
were you present during the last struggle asked m d avrigny				107.95701421951816
besides it doesn t concern me it relates to mademoiselle marie michon ah that is true said athos				9.432456857621418
she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for liberty				2471.704019774585
besides although the ballet was danced the evening had scarcely begun				29603.520671062222
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind				38.609419122140935
i have been waiting for a long time to tell him what i think of him				21.866216445514013
as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his maneuvers oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis				14.868955168645902
but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o clock in the evening then would come night and with night sleep				717.9464863969462
oh no dear count cried aramis is it not a warlike encounter that we are going to what do you mean aramis that the place royale is the termination to the main road to vendomois and nothing else what				653.4321940491204
first m and madame de saint méran incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixir three drops were sufficient then followed barrois the old servant of m noirtier who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir the same happened to valentine of whom he was jealous he gave her the same dose as the others and all was over for her as well as the rest why what nonsense are you telling us said château renaud				1.3368569782988922
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg of you monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m villefort entered				64.65734529533819
each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle				24.392381482690382
signed abbé busoni it is the same what do you mean said the major				137.16734900169791
if richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great				5468.272671410638
now i don t set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at tyburn or sent for change of scene to the indies				29599.681352088744
villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper				9855.806373545318
the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour				224.86166301639798
this point settled the duke turned to d artagnan				1.0109322073958251
they both approached the window and through a slit in the shutter they saw bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak				114.59711772220366
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir				92.33062113033367
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect				18479.725885019074
what a gourmand you are growing i haven t seen you with so cheerful a face these five years the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramee s ideas grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him				7.7796791920606685
the procureur exerted himself to reply				679.9442457215184
this noirtier was his father had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dantès or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words				2574.4351979978424
you know or you don t know that that is what we ask of you oh				74.82957566555883
well you can ask my servant or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow it was the talk of the house and this elixir where is it				89.08025597376974
your husband then is at last dead how does that concern you replied the swiss				342.5635721182001
i wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the palais royal do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing danger my lord exclaimed d artagnan with a look of astonishment what danger i am told that there is a general insurrection the uniform of the king s musketeers carries a certain respect with it and even if that were not the case i would engage with four of my men to put to flight a hundred of these clowns did you witness the injury sustained by comminges monsieur de comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers which means i suppose that the musketeers are better soldiers than the guards the cardinal smiled as he spoke				1045.031443816883
yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé s gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays 0327m so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbé for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases you are wrong to speak thus said the abbé and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error what mean you inquired caderousse with a look of surprise				1468.5836317745204
monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter				10295.143586050202
bonacieux was going that was to follow her				11.358213940313856
albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume				181.82469052832855
that s too many gentlemen too many				30794.829494028825
well he asked that will do will it not yes my lord on one condition what that grimaud shall wait on us at table nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud				6831.802286884885
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts				97050.47181924795
but his temper cooled down like his friend s he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it so much the better said athos				5.327025584598179
presently the army came in sight of lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault				82389.46975643658
does your majesty remember when playing in the park of fontainebleau or in the palace courts at versailles ever to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound of thunder yes certainly well then this noise of thunder however much your majesty may have wished to continue playing has said go in sire				580.2602752045807
immediately m de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms				192.21967503314804
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eels all light wholesome food suitable for the sick but the wine said d artagnan who furnishes the wine				809.1782064132226
oh tis here tis here tis over my sight is gone my senses fail				9731.233422095303
yes madame replied the coadjutor i have to beg you to reflect twice ere you cause a civil war in the kingdom the queen turned her back and the laughing recommenced				195331.82594696633
the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head				256.81955025338436
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions				5314.821466466758
several inns were visited by them several innkeepers questioned without a single clew being given to guide their inquiries when at montreuil athos felt upon the table that something rough was touching his delicate fingers				1663.5567966921499
the people were shouting and running about with torches				15709.990939909701
well continued the cardinal in an indifferent tone the only thing to be sought for at this moment is some woman handsome young and clever who has cause of quarrel with the duke				436.6067471957865
when we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been				1931.3227450125614
i will take him dead that s all a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse				9803.161405923915
i know the world is a drawing room from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid that is to the purpose				220.71736924411582
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest				4994.889165308202
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door				60.73665307733572
because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates on your honor is that true cried albert				68.71287562097707
when the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze				5476.205145245768
my god it is i i and this fellow who will help me to avenge myself chapter lvi				9145.379925844798
why did you not tell me so before				311.47280373292205
on entering the room noirtier s eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room				32.22166601404739
the hangings were of damask the carpets from alencon and the bed especially had more the look of a fine lady s couch with its trimmings of fine lace and its embroidered counterpane than that of a man who had made a vow that he would endeavor to gain heaven by fasting and mortification				19706.641219326462
let us not lose a moment the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game				11912.488683118085
mercédès read with terror the following lines the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès second in command on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo is the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris				22.67622793455058
you foolish fellow said athos laughing				37.32545883405296
i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your father s favor and that i might do him justice				1627.6789721128087
he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property				842.9575004266397
coquenard did not seem to observe it				6.6372624660333175
what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself chapter 90				1412.7346130989688
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon				272.1404991196971
these people who are looking at us are only merchants said athos and are looking more at the cargo than at us i shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and i shall make for the dunes as soon as possible sandy hills about dunkirk from which it derives its name				6960.94902589023
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously				16908.50216796261
suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man				1.357779958722014
adieu madame replied the king s attorney as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door				39.91116056652235
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat				1893.4754484019752
this is the second or third time monsieur that you have repeated that name and yet i have told you that i do not know him you do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked				8592.649560868324
she calculated that to cross this corner of france and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days				925.7035180468896
on my right i saw the tree behind me the rock				5001.328798010197
fernand went and mercédès remained alone				315.72673930914755
apply to the steward on the first day of every month and you will receive the same sum there now again you degrade me how so by making me apply to the servants when i want to transact business with you alone well be it so then				205.2849459893723
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs				4729.417805089959
do you not remember him yes said dantès and without relinquishing mercédès hand clasped in one of his own he extended the other to the catalan with a cordial air				103.17129715660718
do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come i have been advised of it but the three millions the three millions are probably on the road then i shall really have them oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment				144.11465356422667
wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished then only she pretended to hear the sound of felton s steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees				136.5486948276285
danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee				16888.083872434498
to eat do you hear are you hungry come you understand me what would your excellency like to eat a piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place bread				3879.29478978843
where then could he be if he had entered his mother s room and not since returned				614.3332121680911
now continued faria addressing dantès with an almost paternal expression now my dear fellow you know as much as i do myself				121.46212776408645
it is you mordaunt he said				7.440939430836512
the house of thomson french had 300 000 or 400 000 francs to pay this month in france and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the money otherwise morrel sighed deeply and passed his hand over his forehead which was covered with perspiration				2262.040109646912
not a penny of what i possess will pass into your hands				125.82202785091799
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word				173.08756568923351
yes you have a recipe for it an infallible one that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink yes said monte cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed may we inquire what is this recipe asked debray				152.1078814400175
the queen saving us her friends nothing more moral				14599.620865362564
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures				3990.279030198521
de saint méran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression she appeared to be stupefied				1343.4731195873271
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a music room for julie who never played				2938.792357118039
m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character				6625.677846253862
baron danglars one two three four five said monte cristo five millions why what a crœsus you are this is how i transact business said danglars				60.28118333900868
during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape				1602.3371775163098
am i to accompany you your excellency cried bertuccio				257.0519640689306
there what do you think now of the affair				821.7422118026617
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals				33055.11083395258
then said d artagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer				1326.12920748901
well my dear porthos said d artagnan that s the very thing it came into my head to do athos understood all now				392.5720731319527
well asked the abbé as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do to tell you all i know was the reply				460.7061977502809
as to d artagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive				48985.76060671874
no said the notary then perhaps it is to your son m de villefort no the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator				20266.821467996087
no that is sufficient a man can pass through that porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through				6137.306633537203
my god my god said she thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer give me then strength to suffer the door opened gently the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued god of vengeance				1535.5731141731205
i do not understand my lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out				96.63748607786754
i have devoted myself to industry i study the useful arts				7781.089729438456
do you preach them no i sell them to those of my cloth who wish to become great orators ah indeed				42.10412358540408
the count continued i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety				5558.624712649577
while exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls they excited them secretly to quarrel deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants				3960.82014600154
i suspect said he a tall dark man of lofty carriage who has the air of a great lord				4030.8518789932546
is this carriage for me said dantès				130.15819199823923
beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness				12996.792636606535
scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair				157.00958257405583
are you too proud to accept it young gentleman no sir said d artagnan and i will guard it so carefully that i will be sworn it shall arrive at its address and woe be to him who shall attempt to take it from me m de tréville smiled at this flourish and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window where they had talked together he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of recommendation				900.9988580417904
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength				1660.1192534038394
i have now been six years with m noirtier and let him tell you if ever once during that time he has entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand no signed the old man				1.1816036732963235
sit down morrel and wait morrel obeyed the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven				162.11507571899526
d artagnan s plan was very simple				30804.05250161344
no one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking a fowling piece powder and shot dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude				5911.552537388229
let us talk a little said she				57.56691429380531
at first indeed they were doubtful whether the king s visit to the parliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens but scarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further increased when cries of down with mazarin long live broussel long live blancmesnil resounded through the city				645.3195600134785
i shall hear from you yes thanks thanks dear love adieu the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue				12824.884766578813
all this looks suspicious they said a quarter of an hour				145.6513099214441
and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this mazarin would have you hanged do you think so i am sure of it then i would kill him rather than let him go and you would act rightly				1894.1473098842637
you are about to become captain at nineteen an elevated post you are about to marry a pretty girl who loves you and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of someone you are right you know men better than i do and what you say may possibly be the case i confess but if such persons are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you				6.460903365463916
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to st germain				102.36782599728896
a letter from the king perhaps				705.3027396634302
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat				277.56727794939235
no said the captain i make but one bargain and i have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at boulogne and shall we arrive there safe and sound as true as my name s jack butler well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand pistoles hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in there the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven o clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named				6093.647169996414
i mean that m de monte cristo digging underneath these trees found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there neither of them there repeated madame danglars her staring wide open eyes expressing her alarm				9392.841830555662
the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed monsieur groslow and his companions sir replied mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is sincere				23136.38836536443

thanks guitant i shall benefit by your advice this very evening here they separated and bidding adieu to guitant in the court of the palais royal mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure				27836.41520019981
who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m de richelieu who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine my friends monsieur the queen shook her head				6.074286369302546

monseigneur your eminence is a hundred times too kind to me and on the contrary i think i have not proved myself worthy of your goodness				71599.37263872342
i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutter yes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to d artagnan i was not speaking to you sir but i am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn				1888.559342638645

well said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count				94.3090781296773

his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom				9217.925546931609
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed				6089.969692522314

the carmelite convent at béthune chapter lxii				7537.247224016011
noirtier continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression				434.21683338188814
then he drew from his waistcoat pocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand				22.076988630881022
drink this and then take nothing more tonight valentine stretched out her hand but scarcely had she touched the glass when she drew back in fear				1818.5391684996537

at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed d artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock				1127.3747947577303

the celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the count s possession				829.9943201500042
the four or five remaining hours before nine o clock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visits designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker s in their gayest equipages dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative				34033.043659674004

d artagnan returned to change his workman s clothes for his chestnut colored suit and porthos to put on his red doublet				3531.7002218735656

from whom comes this letter from her majesty as i think from her majesty said buckingham becoming so pale that d artagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal				12189.892315667656
dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him				2.126082667494225
en route gentlemen and the troop grumbling angrily disappeared in the darkness and took the road to paris				70.58810788152681
one of them stationed upon the top stair naked sword in hand prevented or at least endeavored to prevent the three others from ascending				22410.553254567527
to all the simple things which escaped our gascon milady replied with a smile of kindness				5651.55826072013
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you d artagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in milady s soul whose depths were dark and unknown				10719.537641340254
you see my strength fails me you see plainly i can not walk				5399.897681075276

again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with dantès request he began to speak of other matters				590.7565024019254
for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases madame said d artagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him what				323.7337865733061

you pledge yourself to that marshal added gondy turning to la meilleraie				39437.32700988945
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos and aramis and an officer was examining their passports				20989.076842646537
athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to grimaud s ear				400.413563198705
you have perhaps no money perhaps is too much said d artagnan smiling				16.015365466417744

no but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet				71165.79958991066
d artagnan fought three times with rochefort and wounded him three times				1211.9571344652459
d artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error				1816.0157886171764
i remember now milady looked around her as if in search of something				1815.6555917193677
milady passed her two arms round felton s neck and let herself slip out of the window				38.919603502393834
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate				1735.8812305445776
no positively i will not go				405.8169883417228
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended				23335.356895542638
one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin				25557.922387917202
let us attend to what is more pressing first and then we will attend to my wound besides it does not seem very dangerous and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy functionary				49996.145666211545

she traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage				779.1058050010807
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another				40.4711807205385
this is all very easy for you to say replied d artagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect but for me who am without any settled means and without resources for me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet this is serious answered the three friends it is a family affair				223.31080992877793
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but d artagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down to night upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur d artagnan to the end of the world				280.73164039432965
yield he cried or you are a dead man the musket fell from the soldier s hands who yielded on the instant				183.29707691199147
the gascon uttered a furious imprecation which was answered by a wild laugh on the other side of the iron panel				20629.331948643106
what do you want with me said she				34.152299070645405
what means this asked the count				8.897198196297053
i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you yes and by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison noirtier s joy continued				1211.319293928374
now on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it eaten				3651.552002096365
here cried porthos here porthos foresaw that if d artagnan was called away he should remain the sole possessor of the bed				539.265410682769
he is very young but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes				3533.667735330077
but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured				11747.94085764042
no i remain replied athos with a threatening gesture that promised no good to whomsoever it was addressed				735.2391972499855
besides his probity was irreproachable in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with their religion and their consciences lovers with the rigorous delicacy of our era and the poor with god s seventh commandment				24367.732338665715
at the same time added château renaud your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti there are no italian banditti said debray				59.92420541831084

they opened it and found 900 000 francs in bank scrip				28307.421348613105
the last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter				225.33694537489015

my dear fellow let them sleep on if they are asleep let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you deep grief was depicted on morrel s features he seized monte cristo s hand				29.008586080583886
you know there s only one way of saying things so i went in and said my lord we were not the strongest party yes i know that he said but give me the particulars you know porthos i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so i merely said they were fifty and we were two				1745.9590462972537
aramis came behind giving his arm to porthos				331.5360947171355
now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness				5180.056780561932
then the cardinal put out the waxlight slipped it into his pocket and taking up the lantern now he said for monsieur de la fere very good thought d artagnan tis our road likewise we will go together all three set off on their walk mazarin taking the middle alley and the friends the side ones				4839.121559385972

place this man in the care of his guards again and let him wait till i send for him no monseigneur no it is not he cried bonacieux no i was deceived				219.58467866739875
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity				2334.1154122475205
what a puritan you are said he that happens every day but you can not break it off in this way the morcerfs are depending on this union indeed positively then let them explain themselves you should give the father a hint you are so intimate with the family i where the devil did you find out that at their ball it was apparent enough				669.281403755134

the solitary light burning at the catalans that first sight of the château d if which told him whither they were leading him the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard his despair when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality				2318.747932555568

he was des roches le masle canon of notre dame who had formerly been valet of a bishop who introduced him to his eminence as a perfectly devout man				171.28121401918187
you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw				1282.9759241747072
the guards retired the room resumed its obscurity				2530.8593835960496
coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment				5991.7294719779175
if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again				292.2905095122547
bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled				37182.054011787935
he may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh				23263.47507588475
well he said to the lieutenant				84.22161954874441
why on making a thrust at my adversary whom i had already hit three times and whom i meant to finish with the fourth i put my foot on a stone slipped and strained my knee truly honor				2266.709975535565
with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details				11279.743854203032
our blow has failed for to night let us withdraw				549.9801375348825
shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès				2529.1487085469125
without me you would both have died				6041.280715084416
is it you baron said he				5.165578633847996
your eminence may believe added d artagnan that we would have come to meet you if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward us with so few attendants the cardinal bit his mustache and even his lips a little				1004.9566642375721
what a pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead				161.95374844063193
one step farther into rest two perhaps into silence				628.2755593156411
on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the baron s equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle				971.8666253610463
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queen s letter short but explicit gave him the clue				11208.402750908363
mordaunt after having listened at the door of the cabin to hear if the musketeers were still asleep had gone down into the cellar convinced by their silence that they were all in a deep slumber				1010.4421359363596
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention				2666.558803908806
pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly				55.22993610113775
i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife do you think so i am sure of it and you have heard his fortune mentioned nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing and what is your opinion i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression well and it is that my opinion is that all these old podestàs these ancient condottieri for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces my opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land very little at least i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca ah he has a palace said danglars laughing come that is something yes and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house				211.4869236499588
oh the train is well laid the plot is clever				5257.116648802393
sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies				2240.5413072799847
of that which i am ready to feel toward you and what is that proof are you willing that i should this evening pass with you the time i generally spend with your mistress oh yes said kitty clapping her hands very willing well then come here my dear said d artagnan establishing himself in an easy chair come and let me tell you that you are the prettiest soubrette i ever saw and he did tell her so much and so well that the poor girl who asked nothing better than to believe him did believe him				22.62882527764517
it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first				345.6693997502507
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved him i love him				39.28956632914572
at ten o clock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented				12247.713194775344
in the country people alter one gets to like without knowing it all those beautiful objects that god causes to spring from the earth which are despised in cities				10286.889778442717
at this moment a shriek was heard that seemed to come from the river				813.7696351007111
but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered				2477.1752359190036
when we arrive at the summit of our wishes success has usually the power to drive away sleep on the first night after the fulfilment of long cherished hopes				1273.4488867380544
at length after a journey of nearly an hour the carriage stopped before an iron gate which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe in form massive and isolated				5356.209851042695
as to getting him drunk the duke couldn t hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it				20.372800194996486
and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god				1221.7748591603386
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her embarkation				4727.3615443537865
it was evident that there the rope ladder was to be attached				8801.898042697077
a spent ball not even that what is it then we have said that athos loved d artagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man				1.0810251269174447
and besides he said going out of this chamber isn t all dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday				327.46271672802254
well what have you to say				130.5857707737441
and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver				360.3692884022979
you see he has a truly royal escort ay there s no fear in the daytime but at night we redouble our precautions and what method of surveillance do you employ eight men remain constantly in his room the deuce he is well guarded then				3821.469057710971
see i have thought about you look at the good breakfast we are going to have nothing but what you are fond of andrea indeed inhaled the scent of something cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provençal kitchens of an inferior order added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves				2463.8622929393086
but de winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying my god i thank thee that he knows me only chapter xli				3641.9532401341794
my good nanette be quiet i beseech you said broussel				2686.3441309343884
then we are once more reunited said andrea				88.1860927629649
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man				353.6725505681908
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise				7845.027375622336
ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty really count replied franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly				77.64869832335573
concerning a court intrigue chapter ix				2177.932861708538
he sends me for that purpose and here i am the poor woman s head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees				141.74721508034156
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner				934.3284298500381
as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous				6742.570032260338
i like everyone and you include me in the expression everyone many thanks let us not mistake said monte cristo i love everyone as god commands us to love our neighbor as christians but i thoroughly hate but a few				40151.77411282353
give it to me the captain gave him a loaded carbine the traveller slowly raised it and fired in the air				241.44066855276364
there is one in particular which he prefers in his journeys large enough to hold all the world your valise is then empty asked porthos with simplicity				18895.34934622516
d avrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips				58.380909543044666
a friend maximilian and who is this friend				448.1781250436821
that time you had nothing to say to me i had risked my life and favor to see you but for a second				300.1741689204101
happily for him he has ceased to bear that name and therefore said d artagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abbé d herblay				3.359279199752024
she is to correspond with nobody she is to speak to no one but you if you will do her the honor to address a word to her that is sufficient my lord				9.296851270872008
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely				833.8461779013772
laugh then said monsieur de retz they are looking at us and leaving aramis he went to talk with madame de chevreuse who was in the midst of a large group				29256.508641977307
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria				32.618620569091306
there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse				2110.6229633927815
are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo				38092.48918890163
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie				1881.3651956772503
he is dead villefort drew back a few steps and clasping his hands exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy dead and so soon too yes it is very soon said the doctor looking at the corpse before him but that ought not to astonish you monsieur and madame de saint méran died as soon				5122.158909642918
his grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious				4447.853956866601
a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship				433.63561724463597
without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it for all my tears my cares my exile and my chains i have my youth my prayers and god who counts my pains her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination				1389.3487420589652
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend s ear				590.7114329769222
we are all mortal my poor friends you are late my dear porthos yes there were some people on the way who delayed me				4.969519234842057
well we will reflect and perhaps we will beg him				51.77256177249484
the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor andrea cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune				10375.364964584598
the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him				4.362134688474219
five minutes after andrea left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus				17125.7704691072
his excellency the count of monte cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion they resolved to profit by the count s courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained				8191.472876047999
i have no business in london but others wish that you should go there but who are those others				2857.0183823798984
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me				1548.2855006454429
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken				1260.9026228388284
as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little rest and that when they returned he should be easier				927.0653853556163
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand				979.0197901603951
well if you will have the truth and me too said athos				8.281259540331234
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo				1.0043058397652462
de saint méran whose sole heiress i am				103.08337235984558
the telegraph m and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawing room and was still awaiting them there				523.1013136975173
there were two means of gaining his object to search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the trench				132995.16412358746
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness				4730.175600275383
fortune lavishes her smiles upon you do not let her flee from your embrace				6076.962408654164
do you think that i sorrow for madame danglars				10.041580898923241
i own i was seeking them why when all was arranged listen count the affair is serious and unavoidable did you doubt it no the offence was public and everyone is already talking of it well well i hoped to get an exchange of arms to substitute the sword for the pistol the pistol is blind have you succeeded asked monte cristo quickly with an imperceptible gleam of hope				1609.0404518405808
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch				2602.8809304980023
if they recognize you you are lost care not for me sire think only of yourself				154.97154212270473
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity				2855.6945019877753
what is he waiting for asked another				2465.0726970820865
a burning fire a red hot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my shoulder felton uttered a groan				1090.7635098739688
20 the performance of the civil marriage				3959.445435612042
i possess nearly 50 000 livres in right of my mother my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de saint méran will leave me as much and m noirtier evidently intends making me his heir				2039.6820196440303
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done				189.6411116595613
what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame de villefort the world however is mistaken my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile hate you sweet valentine exclaimed the young man how is it possible for anyone to do that alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my stepmother s aversion to me arises from a very natural source her overweening love for her own child my brother edward but why should it i do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation i will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of m and mme				52.66315491511084
he knew all objection would be useless and instantly determined how to act				831.3735433946488
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity				8464.048771077016
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper				4948.943495763987
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn				4356.050592074761
the man in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his hand				27.786410003703466
stay there said aramis i shall return immediately the two friends went toward the shed				123192.82857569108
i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m de saint méran i applied my smelling salts but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied				678.4411919982796
d artagnan went to the window with his habitual composure				1138.7618314516087
the count of san felice pointed out teresa who was hanging on luigi s arm in a group of peasants				2076.0408596935267
these young fellows can none of them drink said athos looking at him with pity and yet this is one of the best chapter xxviii				526.3444914026089
and what do you believe his voice was stifled by sobs				1632.3401319249165
cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off				1263.247853794173
here i am at your eminence s service as well as monsieur du vallon one of my old friends who used to conceal his nobility under the name of porthos porthos bowed to the cardinal				13.549084096042192
mademoiselle eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d armilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events				4975.358999124038
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him				8.507623132619145
at half past seven the retreat was sounded				737.6052673931379
yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit				5985.595607569971
by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt				5666.253611562213
i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man				1.8043637807086512
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle a stab with a knife for instance and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said debray				139.93477406235053
do not lose time comminges he continued get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up be quick or in five minutes the mob will be on us again with swords and muskets and you will be killed				818.9758060231906
it was the advice of athos to go straight to the minister				807.9190133618022
tis raoul who has come back said athos and we can now hear how the poor child is in fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and d artagnan				1.0555800215319522
he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie				622.990166787906
sign it then caderousse signed it				13.241683988743143
franz was the excellency the vehicle was the carriage and the hôtel de londres was the palace the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase				4997.395393549046
you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one				809.4946621911885
you are pale and agitated sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor to mademoiselle de la valliere asked athos quickly				91.60637610405027
he felt that in returning to camp he should re enter slavery nevertheless he did return				689.4406148261697
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life				247.04949926043287
the young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had spoken				693.7938124388565
if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperor s intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched my friend said my mother when your master s orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly				2278.5132353680315
at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry				2325.6531219828253
as to that we know d artagnan s courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle				23.953159936776796
then when the cardinal had ended alas sir				243.46731886817423
he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen				78.20409962704792
locusta and agrippina living at the same time were an exception and proved the determination of providence to effect the entire ruin of the roman empire sullied by so many crimes				1798.5665302291047
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance				1539.8882707218745
the mandaïa 6 never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer				9281.393563922624
the challenge then continued beauchamp i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen				421.60739414581053
monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy can not survive without the countenance of monarchs				196316.569846805
if it is i whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner i reply that i hold monsieur le marechal s opinion in every respect the color mounted to the queen s face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger				504.3648829136341
is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words				393.96049922525964
well planchet how is the good monsieur de wardes				12.206896112118388
mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw				987.7123031832152
it is all one to us to us who do not command to morrow s expedition chatillon and flamarens looked at each other				41.062704990518455
but how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage a smile lit up the old man s face a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face				40.51407430364864
then he had a moment s hesitation				1672.1762468471284
and why so asked porthos warmly				245.18025044943818

if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through for i never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos				94.74205150884862
then he said to himself i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody				178098.43914636734
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de médicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik that is just said richelieu				4353.355315693412
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape				1479.6622480599963
what is it then mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance				172.0936601108091
when the name of colonel fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial				2126.668672372691
i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet				273816.1496453038
it is he who has raised all this revolt the more reason said mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal the queen sprang to the window				73.74642185382366
when you please replied beauchamp allow me only to compliment m de morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity oh yes said château renaud				1.2936778063305012
who s up there said the man				270.20171629956377
i am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in france				59.79844014656873
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity				693.9245012807474
england needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch				20490.941505664126
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point				4039.718468825651
athos gave raoul some of the holy water				1919.8042085479092
d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise which was not quite free from joy				230.12781510948358
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table what are the two fish asked danglars				63.89864064996541
it was fourteen years day for day since dantès arrest				1827.7541961607858
now if you are mad and try to bite me i will kill you without pity				1116.185180942555
he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons				6681.249110898484
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly				273.9562562236975
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor				143.96403107767085
yes yes continued lord de winter i understand				154.3600047032341
as i told you everything can be attained porthos women and doors by proceeding with gentleness you re a great moralist and that s the fact said porthos				9.309463075735508
is your name bonacieux said he				5.117269775648154
buckingham left alone walked toward a mirror				40660.34203186108
the solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered the table prepared for the signature it was a gilt table supported on lions claws				3239.02565456649
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him				3.6290419299194023
this is something new replied the king				24.189509474832715
and now at last said the queen now that we are alone repeat your counsel monsieur le coadjuteur it is this madame that you should appear to have reflected and publicly acknowledge an error which constitutes the extra strength of a strong government release broussel from prison and give him back to the people oh cried anne to humble myself thus				522.6762013153716
madame bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is found no athos no you are mistaken said d artagnan i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies but i am ignorant				969.878264148928
then it is for to day asked the king				20.32809942492457
but my lord tell me she continued hide nothing from me what is in truth the king s position				1231.8741646780534
however she offered the cardinal laporte s place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other				89.04564412714271
he is calling you said the count he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom death would have separated you calls you to him				132.20668749040948
as to the second reproach i have heard it said that she does not love the english but an englishman well and by my faith said athos it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being loved				2636.623726237672
breathing that sea breeze so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is approached contemplating all the power of those preparations she was commissioned to destroy all the power of that army which she was to combat alone she a woman with a few bags of gold milady compared herself mentally to judith the terrible jewess when she penetrated the camp of the assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots horses men and arms which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate like a cloud of smoke				2511.082656626979
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets				804.5958020897605
the countess had this portrait painted during the count s absence				941.6730723158764
the next morning danglars awoke late though he went to bed so early he had not slept well for five or six nights even if he had slept at all				306.43791185539595
i have nothing to give you my son but fifteen crowns my horse and the counsels you have just heard				620.0591120566564
the sailors had again hoisted sail and the vessel was once more cleaving the waves				3486.3628330770825
he recognized the influence of mercédès and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless				339.36652792630355
listen then to the supplication of a despairing woman				109.84884261833841
at least i am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and i repeat that i am really interested for the count you asked milady				44.21216751443759
afraid of making any inquiries at this house d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras				20715.603795524
but we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little better				707.0989247794201
as he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to turn				26343.554682857095
has this woman been relating her crimes to you				29.65995108538323
d artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and himself and drawing the commission from his pocket said here my dear athos this naturally belongs to you athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles				571.9526703977745
the man remained in the village the woman had had a relay of horses and continued her journey				494.6711432236993
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition				5812.824545694583
yes if i die well valentine resumed maximilian i can only say again that you are right				57.31842534881132
as he was accustomed to do in all cases of any consequence d artagnan went straight to the residence of athos				230.65150964744333
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude				28202.708807770727
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither				1909.1853567813262
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction an admirable subject cried the jesuit				275.4526742470735
m de tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news				3233.251334424935
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost mad what will not reality do but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you which asked the young man				1.133693808261679
he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field				5443.298111484434
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort s for the purpose of returning the procureur s visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion				748.4360221094516
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am				125.4413862684303
it was very hard the horse said morcerf laughing				67.54121722711142
at length m de tréville himself returned				857.1443316635067
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled				727.5422613950194
come your excellency the count added turning to franz here is luigi vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet him				1.6395007408380735
i wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody i agree monsieur but do not be too confident				12943.97485129329
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his hair under a priest s wig the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into an abbé				3358.293740727768
if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost for a man so well off will never change his happy condition and i shall fail with him as i have already done with aramis chapter xi				4963.979594323609
that is another thing said porthos				8.944255018722428
there are only fifteen feet more from the top down here and the grass is soft the duke had already begun to descend				3082.469579677287
ah exclaimed d avrigny in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery				5345.330488867414
the past is another thing said athos sighing the past and the future are you afraid for your young raoul asked aramis				8.95185839515501
they are soldiers though resumed de bragelonne				160.20666740335895
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream				777.1059554976282
i believe not nevertheless i believe she runs some great peril from which your grace alone can extricate her i cried buckingham				259.481719855704
d artagnan he said you are here to night still infuriated by yesterday s adventure				701.3085857206177
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar				751.1396360679043
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while mme				83.92223805383301
come he said if i pay you the 100 000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease certainly said peppino				2048.342845039303
an explanation at the opera said the count with that calm tone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause is good				1113.097685165123
but à propos resumed m de tréville what has become of your three companions i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them none monsieur well i left them on my road porthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining see there now said m de tréville and how the devil did you escape by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry there again				450.3924630597667
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the left				974.5865413673329
ask my beloved sister haydée who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy day while talking to me of you you then love haydée asked monte cristo with an emotion he in vain endeavored to dissimulate				25369.81752976631
it wants ten minutes to nine said he				12.047320245223085
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk				1236.0677102136278
yes it is very annoying said vampa but we have not seen him then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions but in vain then after a time they disappeared				77.68914100865415
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said				35.03869385613675
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted				2631.875638781891
this lasted several minutes until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the stairs				50.22464354929859
no doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts				8950.702543668627
ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him				3.406231136472671
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme				212.93312015590013
what my maid tells me but what does she tell you that when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge				12340.018522385186
mercédès is not yet your wife				476.90140005797986
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back				303.46527275416037
in a few hours they were in the capital				3026.674249954082
meanwhile he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues and recalling the saying of louis xi his political predecessor as he himself was the predecessor of robespierre he repeated this maxim of tristan s gossip divide in order to reign henry iv when besieging paris had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls				3428.0068164847007
have you a name then i bear that of your brother ay but you are mistaken				207.37998045701698
the insult at the banker s door beauchamp stopped morcerf				105.70630683514011
in the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman s happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings				38594.29243631654
who is this creature grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time				35.37233048091831
among these two hundred levees that of tréville was one of the most sought				2194.769695016844
adieu gentlemen and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away				29.93943769027625
is she not free to love whomsoever she will oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing				104.42458712232072
concerning a court intrigue in the meantime the forty pistoles of king louis xiii like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed				3796.2022542908676
but your wife monsieur what has she to do with all this her devotion to the queen is known and they wish either to remove her from her mistress or to intimidate her in order to obtain her majesty s secrets or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy that is likely said d artagnan but the man who has abducted her do you know him i have told you that i believe i know him his name i do not know that what i do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil genius but you have seen him yes my wife pointed him out to me one day has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him oh certainly he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his temple a scar on his temple cried d artagnan and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriage why that s my man of meung he is your man do you say yes yes but that has nothing to do with it				8.383232481187774
aramis must have worn himself to a shadow of his former self by constant genuflexion he cast his eyes again on the letter				333.2387994018952
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near				1266.7790159795093
my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart and he gave him his hand				77.55419202792136
ask his lackey how often he has had to prepare lint of him alas sighed bazin				1280.5366694917866
a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal				1244.3570436383804
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river				4808.942015593379
with your tastes and means of gratifying them continued danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade				4551.79048429447
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me				11.56782347519023
come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed				449.6319826852806
my dear mr mordaunt said mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare how extremely your history interests me				79.77643140908374
you will take your place in the coupé to châlons				7181.358503122643
immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck half past four				5841.37158749176
with a man like you i fear nothing athos bowed				51.064753380406025
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window				243.59064219991185
in exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badly as witness chalais and mme				215.37305705400638
no and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer at rome things can or can not be done when you are told anything can not be done there is an end of it it is much more convenient at paris when anything can not be done you pay double and it is done directly that is what all the french say returned signor pastrini somewhat piqued for that reason i do not understand why they travel but said albert emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel				21077.61697341096
but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury the nubian smiled				769.3433635389126
listen now to what i say in this my dying moment				300.21825749076703
d artagnan and the englishman d artagnan followed milady without being perceived by her				20.643903461838647
is monsieur d artagnan there yes madame in your oratory				63969.83209831479
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all the astonished president looked at the jury who in turn looked at villefort				84.79803168255049
which whichever of the three you like i have no preference and the rich caparison is that mine too without doubt you laugh d artagnan no i have left off laughing now that you speak french what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silver are they all for me for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos peste they are three superb animals i am glad they please you why it must have been the king who made you such a present certainly it was not the cardinal but don t trouble yourself whence they come think only that one of the three is your property i choose that which the red headed boy is leading it is yours good heaven				1862.021476061631
how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left he is not a prince simply a count a count and a rich one too eh yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very good tempered gentleman oh be easy				184.40544887393207
the latter took in the whole scene at a glance				3515.9961476682483
i will pay twenty five piastres for my passage back to leghorn				16550.118177651995
on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides yes added athos i now ask you d artagnan what side you are on				555.5524246104999
i dread this marriage maximilian as much as you thank you my adored valentine thank you that is enough				525.1917467074206
this fresh impertinence reached the ears of the cardinal and alarmed him greatly				4646.08820848084
it appears to me that the news you bear is worth the trouble of a little diligence my chaise broke down coming into lilliers capital what capital yes i want your chaise and how shall i travel then on horseback you talk very comfortably a hundred and eighty leagues what s that one can do it				240.93187964241463
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him				26.649455698950167
by the bye he said i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for porthos and d artagnan the thing is done dear friend said athos i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself you are a wonderful man my dear count said aramis you think of everything well have you made up your mind to this journey quite and now that i reflect about it i am glad to leave paris at this moment and so am i replied athos my only regret is not having seen d artagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project when supper was over blaisois entered				43.2950484020144
he has i repeat the longest head of the four and for my part i declare that i will obey him				13.82100738162983
the soil was humid and glittering with the rain which had recently fallen and the refreshed herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy				9043.273465781653
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept				21853.199565035342
monsieur is as usual led by his favorite yesterday it was choisy to day it is la riviere to morrow it will be some one else				1174.0649130987952
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step				242.44967954734767
but we are no longer in the city sir said she				111.02801983498695
this chancellor was a pleasant man				227.32996874346472
whom do i see yonder where in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that door a man wrapped in a cloak it is he cried d artagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man				467.6491940923737
why edmond dantès and myself were intimate friends exclaimed caderousse whose countenance flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbé fixed on him while the clear calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny				1800.9815022109908
yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein				1674.3233084496414
d artagnan and planchet entered pierrefitte together				421.40097859236
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried athos				7.437931236353266
if perchance m de morcerf came he would find m cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of eugénie has never been admitted you may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings him but should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be displeased he				873.4612776851168
a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing				934.949248872866
there are four men come to arrest me				7.289546778783877
it is no doubt the same said he				8.444741738460175
listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which i have the key it leads into the park				967.2918645282545

my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious				17317.88015096008
look at your brother monarch charles i				22.025450162200332
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender				32951.560033152535
nothing will give greater pleasure to all your old friends and i know one down there behind the saint nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it mercédès said the old man				1.133978006988427
de saint méran madame de saint méran m noirtier how				235.37942974866687
i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which				3022.088254023158
he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier				2106.597088311334
monsieur the cardinal cried the stupefied musketeer				465.3604432287001
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving d artagnan learned that he exercised from six o clock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine o clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern				7973.70744425643
these keys were given up to him instantly				2280.6198063762645
well my lord said la ramee with his rude laugh you still set yourself against this poor fellow so				152.46347924016501
are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man				1.1454610800745442
they all four entered the tent they had no plan ready they must think of one				377.38744366589884
i tell you i am going to die do you understand				66.95983616581591
as i came into the public room i saw one of our englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from bleeding				35361.10234002217
the invalid s eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable				7907.438949902226
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd				564.9106277659017
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her				27.922910252262913
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind				37.38400727613807
you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart				170.01929685638905
as to athos he remained unmoved				4755.994867223864
but there is nothing which would do nothing 40114m oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help				713.5489128789978
bonacieux what is that noise that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness				539.0715606262141
never mind i ll fix that all right				144.45321792294027
the safety of a cavalier often depends on the prompt obedience of his horse				255.67086995449026
is this that bonacieux asked he after a moment of silence				116.68128338256912
but if i am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint it is a bad year for kings said gondy shaking his head look at england madame yes but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france replied the queen				7504.22585465389
is it large middling how is it arranged faith i should require pen ink and paper to make a plan they are all here said caderousse briskly				135.69839278680115
the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive				5221.1525006780075
i have only two adversaries i will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even them they are time and distance				3292.8893600626184
madame i never eat muscatel grapes replied monte cristo as if the subject had not been mentioned before				688.9792030276966
they passed into the eating room a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen				1721.8116450755706
a priest can understand a father s grief and m de villefort giving the key to d avrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work				361.16215823218863
by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things what have you done oh nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor well monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the post				2088.9499638799443
the four old friends prepare to meet again				441.78324188940246
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple a cabbage for instance				1834.2674705507245
they descended into the plain by the ladder				1704.4318529978054
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let				12025.411298104817
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm then had gone toward aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair				1321.2665380479834
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty				2136.7847270520533
he seemed to see before him the salvation of his administration and of the kingdom sculptured in flesh and bone				2856.8440091380235
have you really met with some great misfortune oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which i have sustained nothing worth mentioning i assure you true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all 900 000 francs are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood 30183m what do you say said the count 900 000 francs				2010.5891188465528
yes yes repeated villefort as he approached his home yes that woman must live she must repent and educate my son the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old man of the wreck of my house				119.85966978431014
why just remember what they said				52.08074314548743
pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion indiscretion oh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject				195.50372882450407
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do				844.0764769807677
upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon				592.3824237651299
light the candles in my apartment if you please the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light				444.321781975665
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner				2849.5394465599084
the red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel s keel floated at the foot of the crag				2014.632281205591
take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of				679.6839447458127
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel				697.2639010795339
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy				4521.548325682138
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead				2862.640804414981
maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word				42.01707030749423
how pale you are the abominable creature murmured d artagnan				1.0108629461448067
in two bounds he was at the louvre as he entered the wicket of l echelle ten o clock struck				77.59488149081146
come in gentlemen come in called d artagnan you are here in my apartment and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party				1561.376343566908
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel				4172.184306112485
gentlemen thus d artagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him				4.160628288781739
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur				2477.2992659899264
what is your sister valentine doing inquired madame de villefort of edward tell someone to bid her come here that i may have the honor of introducing her to the count you have a daughter then madame inquired the count very young i presume the daughter of m de villefort by his first marriage replied the young wife a fine well grown girl but melancholy interrupted master edward snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in order to make a plume for his hat				239.61625720096475
he let the jug fall on the floor and it broke in pieces				7809.428634080334
suppose a watchman should pass and he blew out the light				489.4471091342887
nobody knows who she is or where she comes from				2435.849585547277
well where the devil are you going now cried athos				9.035554955803143
the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain				359.4770118771733
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then d artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter				117.72299782124851
come in tréville the duke saluted and retired				526.1184064415828
i shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit				1561.7441808843616
tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them				155.68093855365777
the valet opened the door and villefort heard someone speak his name				67.94272854240523
oh yes said buckingham grating his teeth with rage				364.53515342106357
blaisois and mousqueton set themselves to preparing their bed which consisted of a plank and a valise				2454.037771440025
and will you direct us exclaimed the young man				1.1842772933470163
at this announcement during which the door remained open everyone became mute and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel				9021.61785139755
it was three o clock when he threw himself on the bed				280.25308593954225
do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control				3890.899208308799
i have doubtless i am dreaming tell me sir he said to the sergeant do you know those three gentlemen who are just gone out only by their passports they are three frondists who are gone to rejoin the duc de longueville tis strange said aramis almost involuntarily i fancied that i recognized mazarin himself the sergeant burst into a fit of laughter				638.9940442887255
having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal s cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation				3925.3745651486315
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of d artagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits on seeing d artagnan rise porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other				57.78230498446178
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising that may possibly be true said maximilian and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood				560.2867870822943
but to return to what we were saying				1361.4469521294411
i have only one thing to say to you				4.483896103138889
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple				6977.6515283446715
i remember just at his age how deep in love i was with a grecian statue which our good king then henry iv gave my father insomuch that i was mad with grief when they told me that the story of pygmalion was nothing but a fable it is mere want of occupation				5359.842927344992
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded				2605.1904941860207
was faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to faria				1732.3718852038821
really sir d artagnan said to him i am pleased to find one with whom to talk in my own poor tongue				1904.3673928786334
i gave her good advice by which she did not profit				56163.4688918596
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear				414.41459621097096
but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust well such things have been that there should be a famine recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans so much the better				690.6900127146494
ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us d artagnan then related all the mad passion of milady and her menaces of death				128.4653842611353
the major recovered his self possession				342.68528728116485
the count first reached an open space and franz followed him closely				2113.3511262101642
can they have received any news my lord not from england madame				293.62261560999764
he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood				8051.25838407789
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed the closed window as though it had been open and as if through the opening he had beheld the menacing old man				2.5508842164169137
i will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will say m de la trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it				17.405417053740226
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an avenger you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes				27431.31327761733
he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as d artagnan had so often done formerly				88301.43675183132
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer				1477.7521255643176
tis god who gives them into our hands answered groslow				219.11442414821957
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one it s true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist				547.226599910391
like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures				5794.217005437533
the father of m de tréville had served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default of money a thing to which the béarnais was accustomed all his life and who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need of borrowing that is to say with ready wit in default of money we repeat he authorized him after the reduction of paris to assume for his arms a golden lion passant upon gules with the motto fidelis et fortis				2938.1366100035716
from the moment he perceived them he did not cease to look at them and seemed to burn with the wish to speak to them				13.520822177854134
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation				240.68454380674106
well if you do not go this very instant i will have you arrested by the queen s orders and i will have you placed in the bastille which you dread so much bonacieux fell into a profound reflection				1719.1781747393559
nothing at all that s a capital arrangement				12758.862402765948
she has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left yes the fleur de lis is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices yes but you say she is english she is called milady but she may be french				534.7229550101538
in this frame of mind grateful for the accidental meeting with planchet pleased with himself d artagnan reached notre dame				52.33597745750547
this can t last and he drew another twenty from his pocket				111.39418880203264
how much have you left of your hundred pistoles d artagnan of my hundred pistoles				567.7918630818516
i threw and i lost what my horse your horse seven against eight a point short you know the proverb athos you are not in your right senses i swear my dear lad that was yesterday when i was telling you silly stories it was proper to tell me that and not this morning				641.0436634623001
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish it you are inflexible				12767.139189796468
come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going dentro la testa answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture				99.43631066803535
ah ah cried he seizing my arm and wresting from me the weapon that had so badly served me you want to take my life do you my pretty puritan				1929.0429568208142
it was a quarter past midday				2718.380600519702
however he toiled on all the night without being discouraged but after two or three hours he encountered an obstacle				15950.57102395802
if you mean to buy any horses get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it at what hour shall we come asked the young man				247.81628444205506
not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy				1688.6633878815867
the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchid s troops that is to say with our enemies				1876.8724849070775
d artagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind it				12.901778615860012
yes i recognize it d artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt				6946.27356499373
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole				1238.619508659365
your eminence does not then know where monsieur de beaufort is yes i do sir in the donjon of vincennes yes sir in a room the walls of which are seven feet thick with grated windows each bar as thick as my arm sir replied mazarin with perseverance one may penetrate through a wall with a watch spring one may saw through an iron bar then my lord does not know that there are eight guards about him four in his chamber four in the antechamber and that they never leave him but he leaves his room he plays at tennis at the mall sir those amusements are allowed but if your eminence wishes it we will discontinue the permission no no cried mazarin fearing that should his prisoner ever leave his prison he would be the more exasperated against him if he thus retrenched his amusement				1702.7048508510773
here i am my lord did you remark that man who is following us yes my lord who is he i do not know only he has followed your grace from the palais royal stopped at the louvre to wait for you and now leaves the louvre with you some spy of the cardinal said de winter to him aside				2924.9435612257475
my hôtel will be always open to you				12.472202273759
you had friends albert break off their acquaintance				1641.4332644176002
my nephew is not yet king and you know laporte has told us twenty times that he himself is in need of almost everything then let us pray to heaven said the girl				499.9371084616225
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees				414.85272759547917
a table ready set out awaited them				14.234973735832066
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt				339.74524207419796
the door being closed the four friends waited in expectation				827.4936487849006
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment				84.85684434368825
the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses he saw albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume				316.746705117417
i m your man i begin to think so particularly if you have not forgotten a certain signal here it is sir and the sailor took from his coat a handkerchief tied at each corner				2301.9422081059056
but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon				640.3922988410582
behind d artagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red cloak				117.44825888158114
she likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you ah said buckingham god be praised				48984.77957084549
on arriving at the king s private antechamber m de tréville found la chesnaye who informed him that they had not been able to find m de la trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king				75.75627840261659
he must have been dreadfully hurt for he did not stir from the place where he fell				754.9573825175268
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband				150.01489034040716
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves				28859.514434479694
ought i not also to have rescued the man that i had accepted for a husband guilty though he were				595.7971206487578
that s a snare said athos don t go d artagnan and yet replied d artagnan i think i recognize the writing it may be counterfeit said athos				6.51213732832568
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino				902.9334064710955
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty				1672.491232039011
but contrary to all expectation when the 31st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision				1769.089812002696
the count praised bertuccio s zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a month				1423.6274562490867
we have parted company this long time all three have left the service where can you find them then wherever they are that s my business well now what are your conditions if i employ you money my lord as much money as what you wish me to undertake will require				5165.356219996079
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father				143.400580375005
porthos knocked at the door of a house to the right whilst d artagnan knocked at the door of a house to the left				585.0232847756862
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected				2404.2336809178073

but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the table				24.399308842126704
that is rather difficult but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty				2552.604817013122
danglars knew that he was heard so he redoubled his blows				4173.9393722631075

come come continued he patting edmond s shoulder kindly you did very right dantès to follow captain leclere s instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble 0027m how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dantès for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer				37547.941396845315
the fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse				797.4410619896871

my turn said athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent my turn				237.92744869780356
and yet that villain benedetto will escape no one i tell you will escape benedetto will be punished then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priest you should have prevented benedetto from killing me i said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast				411.162343344058

he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot				7553.164037547827
what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman				40285.826940379164

no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret				258.8215925026304
suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name				130.6119260148245
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d artagnan who however placed himself between him and them				171.8868275385157
106 and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker				10784.053800101769

all the preparations were made with a frightful calmness				1205.323654384018
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion				468.25255474011055
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and one nights				1305.0317125149288
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them				25.705802323143203

d artagnan s countenance took an expression of the deepest compassion he began to think he had to do with madmen				21817.361905476384

it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formed it was none of these things that attracted the attention it was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdain these were what fixed the attention of all upon him				5.257149986257896

monseigneur au revoir monsieur bonacieux au revoir and the cardinal made him a sign with his hand to which bonacieux replied by bowing to the ground				108.73863956860878
morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every vein				1259.2887119254044

we loved sporting of all kinds better than anything so that he related to me how in the plains of the pampas the natives hunt the tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety but in face of the proof i was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the recital				51224.74157331969
so much the worse so much the worse diavolo as they say in my country reverend sir i am impelled every criminal says the same thing poverty pshaw said busoni disdainfully poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a baker s door but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited				10466.80687851323

ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man				1.2690171089781728
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted				27874.82846045322

the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work				657.5197791035538
speak or no absolution the dying man collected all his forces				33040.55004158726
this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct				7565.946218380279
oh yes scoundrel cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital				14381.816985469555
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages				249.66622161447233
listen to me my dear girl said the gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made athos you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation				4647.30685339898

i know a clever person at tours aramis stopped on seeing athos smile				468.2179475853134
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank notes it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot				2688.236758565972
i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole				4425.496643066141
no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed				67.3451735309264
in may we commenced operations and in the course of the month gained 450 000 francs				347.9593248619427
as he passed the hôtel des gardes he took a glance into the stables				313098.4739003385
athos and aramis walked down toward the port				566.1008807746748
shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian				72.38600209381005
this moment come my lord said d artagnan				1.0069713594521816
the corpse of madame de villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which edward must be those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony				9764.49550821484
morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you				27.794632592404543
he has grown a good deal it seems to me and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place				690.7222894417504
you do not belong to the human species you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back again ah you virtuous men said milady please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin the executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping upon his immense sword				677.6371095234196
i my lord said d artagnan why should i because you shrug your shoulders it is a way i have of speaking to myself				85.15424054040878
i think a little exertion would do me good the two friends walked out on the fortress				49835.43669951188
sir no and i do not know what has become of him so that i am really so unhappy that i weep in fact tears rolled down his cheeks				912.5920417664304
when i go back to france i must suggest some such convenient course to cardinal mazarin and the coadjutor				100.01478944052158
the prince looked at him with unspeakable distrust				7499.804386672202
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos				39.35789501419763
at this word athos and aramis jumped up				287.11272712353014
he then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen garden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and d artagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia				5858.454202921102
you can sign it yes yes said caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge				4525.184874524095
no i would rather die by thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill fortune of the next day to which he had condemned himself by promising mercédès to spare her son the count at last exclaimed folly folly folly to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man to aim at				8999.207321391754
i am a priest sir and the secrets of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human justice do not alarm yourself monsieur we will duly respect your conscience at this moment the abbé pressed down his side of the shade and so raised it on the other throwing a bright light on the stranger s face while his own remained obscured				21992.90267847134
the coadjutor returned to parliament more a monarch than king queen and cardinal all three together				1266.858752733297
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all the fact is said d artagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotedness why i should be a ruined man no for porthos will pay you hum said the host in a doubtful tone				7.192180878090796
ah said aramis but you forget the officer d artagnan grew pale with rage				90.5984678389204
progress of cavalcanti the younger meanwhile m cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria but at the gaming table of the baths of lucca of which he was one of the most assiduous courtiers				1226.043928898799
with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount				28582.92538682414
replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back				657.782883284611
oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm remain said caderousse				33.16889120817366
the messenger resisted my brother killed him oh said mme				29.48431545039837
the fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper				610.5999890563093
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them				25.289628308556814
her mouth was mute but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked				132026.27378477107
the ball was given by the count for the particular pleasure of his daughter carmela whom he adored				2823.560768290868
he is a coward with women perhaps but not with men				1632.0513857467909
you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself				893.0115663935732
well said he extending his hand to monte cristo i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house				103.38690181155434
has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes i do not think so my lord said bernouin but you will hear about him for la ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence tell him to come in said mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed				559.666505092313
thus then the young men made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors				122525.56040180539
madame danglars with tearless eyes but with her breast heaving with concealed emotion placed the bank notes in her bag put the certificate and check into her pocket book and then standing pale and mute awaited one kind word of consolation				4333.237220051651
at last do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you				5.747949560586802
the damps of the dew bathed the head of villefort and refreshed his memory				914.3199464906409
i have drawn nine hundred thousand francs you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs				197.622348702333
i had two hundred thousand francs placed in the hands of morrel son these two hundred thousand francs were the dowry of my daughter who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand francs were payable half on the 15th of this month and the other half on the 15th of next month				2913.5263941501853
a truce to compliments said aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste certainly sir it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante chamber only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy de bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said aramis so we give it up and they hastened to quit the palace followed by bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments				6997.830194101095
yes your majesty cried the duke				13.300554791254008
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented				32113.209752119332
baptiste give me yesterday s paper cried beauchamp				89.49063198821986
are you not a sportsman and a great wolf hunter				7796.733270874919
it was the evening before when i had fallen asleep my sleep then must have lasted twenty four hours				147.8776285318171
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor				2244.8852453828868
well never mind that neighbor caderousse it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that				156.83433958039197
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go				281.4991888906948
come to me d artagnan began to be touched				4721.878048978057
are you making a sketch after poussin oh no was the tranquil response i am too fond of art to attempt anything of that sort				29015.270668888494
he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into prosperity				30236.37870086147
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth				284.7299630569209
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood and he said nothing as he died yes he exclaimed oh i suppose answered d artagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much well sir cried the queen				18.604695441052424
at this instant m de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume				1389.2858066393865
yes undoubtedly the abbé busoni himself replied monte cristo				1.0059154032979118
d artagnan started on seeing these tears				378.3144351802301
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens				72185.36801448755
non siete spagnuolo he said non siete tedesco siete italiano the prisoner started and bit his lips				196.02909499012983
bonacieux against buckingham but above all against d artagnan projects lost in the distance of the future				532.1277553472002
what can cardinal mazarin be to us to four men who compelled such a man as richelieu to act as we pleased				737.3731703012619
porthos and i will stay here the friends obeyed				2114.771486903566
but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the other s condescension				3368.015224090339
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere				3836.6856412653133
in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar				4913.203601933984
the address to monsieur the baron danglars banker rue de la chaussée d antin caderousse wrote the address				6216.0740129890955
on the other hand the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and cry out loudly				3462.5091814869447
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him				5.162509242321146
i lent you money and you returned it that s like good neighbors and we are quits we are never quits with those who oblige us was dantès reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them gratitude what s the use of mentioning that				168.70496444617905
all right and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise				1195.834834598961
unfasten it or i will break it in said grimaud				44.908621984926995
he s not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do				119.32829442765731
d artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army				212.08861140087205
he then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume				713.7513883489528
the abbé did not know the island of monte cristo but dantès knew it and had often passed it situated twenty five miles from pianosa between corsica and the island of elba and had once touched there				124.56814847035659
oho said he is the hotel on fire on approaching the hotel of the roe he found however that it was in front of the next house the mob was collected				6832.258374114573
he is a musician so are all italians come count you do not do that young man justice well i acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the morcerf family to see him throw himself in the way danglars burst out laughing				1565.9439549097692
you have a sad air alas said d artagnan it is because i am the most unfortunate tell me presently said d artagnan				1.0070680378307404
calm yourself dear rene said the soft voice the same thing will never happen again				193.99137174948655
i am neither an angel nor a demon i am a daughter of earth i am a sister of thy faith that is all yes yes said felton i doubted but now i believe you believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of belial who is called lord de winter				2.3158078152976342
the scheme goes forward it seems on wheels dear friend good				207.85755790534287
now barring all that i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine ah well exclaimed château renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more				210.87769166523407
there is a third and the most terrible that is my condition as a mortal being				3712.612200250054
man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours				1144.0897221538517
yes do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing said morcerf				97.27549167711148
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip				7166.744618354327
dinner was waiting but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon franz sat down without him				8.68077351707489
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg™ license when you share it without charge with others				258.2861525025877
drive to the palace said comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive				2728.5971522361046
but who then is andrea cavalcanti asked danglars in amazement				93.43453299828276
these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him				15.952345552708856
no it had just struck four				2495.955238310874
i shall want you this evening he said return in two hours my lord said d artagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i can not miss do not be uneasy said mazarin it is the same good thought d artagnan i fancied it was so return then at five o clock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you				35.866662223105536
with this consoling idea i leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have friends left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the liberty i hasten to restore to you				28.897910539443995
well at a few minutes to seven at a few minutes to seven cried la ramee cold sweat upon his brow				77.80822093918393
good luck to you the young sailor jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the order that he be put ashore at la canebière				4027.216981463198
aha said groslow on account of political opinions				5395.285481518378
d artagnan went straight to the sergeant				685.8933445803807
the queen was seated on a fauteuil and before her were standing two or three gentlemen and among them the duc de chatillon the brother of the nobleman killed eight or nine years previously in a duel on account of madame de longueville on the place royale				177.59350198632467
as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions				397.62520770631824
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress				16595.494475831238
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend				327.32939485732203
pardieu if we may believe the signs grimaud is making we are about to have to do with a very different number of people				861.6853251428662
morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair				104.28913707446875

now said albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are				313.97439787168173
and now to table said athos				7.113350914105629
the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome				14296.772303925627
a table which had been covered with an elegant supper was overturned				39280.35369353277
when he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter it had been decided that they should touch at monte cristo and set out on the following night				20.371367355433307
i hope you will be satisfied with its contents				1292.229743822657
hush cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord				7.028394662148513
ah said the prince laughing i thought we should come to that				61.353721322364784
that is a long time but it is something that you believe so				49.64149704501922
all this she owes to d artagnan without doubt				2107.1496378370953
thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province				3304.0879840948937
if you will permit me i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient masters warranted as such				32031.207546702844
well this man was making signs to another at my left and turning around i recognized the honest grimaud				1062.6662689224343
what ails you said he at length				13.71997900698732
four thousand nine hundred and ninety eight louis said peppino you have paid two louis in advance 50255m what				480.73644800466747
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark				1154.3452795931428
but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper				3787.364445384621
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them				11.315087028916269
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position				576.203861885664
you will be served thus madame three times a day said he				8.740534755227515
you say he loves you maximilian how do you know that he does				188.60457614551234
many small donations 1 to 5 000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs				1557.4167916312185
a leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead man				3.9521824121970255
athos is near you said d artagnan warn him as i have warned you aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution				2850.543751789093
you came from a country where he must be very much talked of and i know that his armaments against france greatly engage the attention of your friend the cardinal my friend the cardinal cried milady seeing that on this point as on the other lord de winter seemed well instructed				17092.56625054389
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence				3087.9716711236106
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m				127.9089086463105
we are safe on that side said buckingham turning toward d artagnan				1.016582250616471
if there are two let parry kill one and you the other				113.891656167764
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze then in the midst of the songs of his sailors songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down he saw the island of monte cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city				878.4836432606534
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist				12316.128372881336
by day they did nothing but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel at night in addition to complines and matins they were further obliged to leap twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of their cells				29986.946702945275
the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father				145.3273301413503
do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences but who perpetrated that joke let me ask				156.71682248966732
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning				26.80186461658855
well i have ten thousand for you you are not boasting do you wish for a proof yes there were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and a third upon the rue saint denis				36.47886651307777
he then motioned to his wife to take leave				14524.33751597318
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal				59.9042925883534
everything is clear to me now				197.43039374967447
this accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes				1426.5385726158745
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene				230.2397704966137
the door is opened to all who knock				22122.84183683424
a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and danglars sighed as m cavalcanti had done half an hour before				175.87526270832788
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes				138.8275211274297
i will go said comminges and if they come back fire not at all not at all replied d artagnan let no one move				938.0496964798451
i shall kill him i can not help it				7.8094390564348855
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coach houses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters				1759.922134202842
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that				48.66654749145783
am i to say what you told me asked valentine				33.65239388196351
you have no idea what a false look you have particularly when you are afraid				979.512889961103
gimblou a glass of wine well how has all gone off zounds				2012.9355248683526
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that d artagnan heard her in the antechamber				353.5017552329343
then i must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my departure porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice				6099.757965839959
what object think you have this expedition to ré and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting				12868.230291765558
did you come from boulogne demanded she of milady				157.34617504993912
and he caused himself to be announced to the minister				972.6941859858129
edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with years and can not now remind my edmond by a smile or by a look of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating				8817.247512256388
but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself				148.1437743356099
you are not hurt asked d artagnan				1.008931278892572
de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror				215.32890149410255
the mind can see as well as the body				898.8601258579455
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo				1.0089718101589742
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor				46.63421545279884
have you informed him of it i wrote to him from boulogne				1637.5869118718817
scattering money round about him as heaven sprinkles rain				5118.0426179183405
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a duty you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive i indeed				67.91098629431897
only take care that i am not seen through the wicket oh it is a proof that the lord is on our side felton replied milady				38.10123246281952
monte cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles by which the machine was worked				18755.028572479056
do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving				11718.601428826987
maximilian said he are your affections disengaged morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment				8.897196075039954
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness yes said the old man				1.1104301213080006
but why did she return to tours without telling me anything because she was in fear of being arrested why has she not written to me then because she was afraid of compromising you d artagnan you restore me to life cried aramis				31.13219321694246
i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money full dress said the major half aloud				2147.4628828966624
milady rushed to the door and opened it				15.299773729970152
0209m since my imprisonment said faria i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record				49938.152717926816
and then he was older than any of us added d artagnan				1.0056122541729113
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to d artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel				291.2195676990778
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked				4985.295180016483
that is no impediment sir said she i have had greater men than you arrested guitant mazarin sprang forward				2465.613457985978
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner				1814.2163835030642
when i become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not before be careful about this force open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and i may perhaps revive perhaps exclaimed dantès in grief stricken tones				9685.39432917261
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos				1645.8214366002558
if the musketeers did not appear things were to go on as had been agreed mme				72.93230686835979
the two rooms looked on to the street a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage				5791.1233858692185
i in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him thanks monsieur returned monte cristo my steward has orders to take a box at each theatre is your steward also a nubian asked debray				108.12681883242564
we who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the place royale yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it				6.036134505050411
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman				117.87612051005257
thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover s arm				436.41317312185436
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the 21st of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o clock				2848.665893759462
i have written a letter today that letter is not yet gone				817.8487659667587
the vessel did touch at elba where he quitted it and passed a whole day in the island				6245.51135423962
it is that indefinable charm which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek it is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light no valentine i assure you such is not the case				782.1044179031773
this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more				238.97111289299855
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris				30.97935451230187
in a few days you will be away from this place your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling				7792.622498960958
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued d artagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen aramis colored imperceptibly				358.0029850933358
and i also said d artagnan i also				160.79620080718757
and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse				2740.8353061603557
death is depicted on his face				31.13092399646607
what were you doing replied she				39.3718415935795
ah said the doctor is it you yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone				816.7084781572796
to lift their hands against a minister of god come here sir said urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other the wounded man smiled sadly				204.403019708298
and having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment he placed the others in the ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a talisman				33735.782690811706
the devil replied the prince surely at the death of mazarin				263.0308556201953
it is the declaration of cardinal spada and the will so long sought for replied edmond still incredulous				3839.1672105803823
i have 1 060 000 francs remaining he said				657.406604564147
this something was enveloped in a cloak and d artagnan at first believed it was a man but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a woman				497.14956424369666
oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that noirtier is the father of villefort i am lost and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts				268.8280255900333
it is absolutely certain that some misfortune has happened to them on the way if we have no news of them this evening to morrow we must start athos nodded affirmatively then turning and monsieur de bragelonne a young man fifteen years of age attached to the prince de condé has he the honor of being known to you diffident in allowing the sarcastic aramis to perceive how strong were his paternal feelings				485.946287747565
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé dantès spoke no more of escape				1095.9410368897768
my leave is at an end do you return to paris asked athos quickly				53.31500156023558
had entertained toward mazarin and he endeavored to receive the minister s homage with civility				1864.8426333471405
doubtless too the horses on their part appreciated the eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was granted them				19.229548457110827
do you call him nebuchadnezzar said mordaunt with a terrible smile no it is charles the first the king the good king charles who despoils his subjects to enrich himself charles glanced a moment at the insolent creature who uttered this but did not recognize him				5.74765698379734
has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep				297.2486847606773
do you not recollect morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess of the arabian nights if you like but tell me my dear lucien what it is that constitutes a princess				732.0697088168456
well it is a question of serving the king the gentleman s duty but the king is with mazarin he is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the king s enemies are preparing for the poor child ah				144.30623254145738
it was indeed planchet and grimaud				144.87040944877526
d artagnan knew what she wanted				344.1736990785061
by the latter i mean your relatives and friends				1751.76982022308
bertuccio said he give fifty five thousand francs to monsieur the steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of bank notes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there				224.14612939176286
grief had made her blind to all but one object that was edmond				2757.478443655268
at the same time and with the rapidity of lightning the stranger drew his				921.3978983685304
pardieu replied d artagnan for my part i am eating veal garnished with shrimps and vegetables and i some lamb chops said porthos				14.187156369265498
that s a match you are playing with his eminence this letter is your game				2823.049190737462
monsieur cardinal is indeed a privileged man imagine my astonishment continued milady when i found myself face to face with this woman does she know you no then she looks upon you as a stranger milady smiled				38.169560229923434
it was then that d artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it				16.419768320601957
do you know them fernand he said				6.610434229000516
the king has nothing like it no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin				110.81338776464858
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger				56.83257326896372
the moccoli or moccoletti are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with first how to keep his own moccoletto alight and secondly how to extinguish the moccoletti of others				206.3300993238867
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword				85.1665446551855
as to d artagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate				1639.3987330789982
begone begone at these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed d artagnan out of the room				13.701235346702353
danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror				451.13981637930686
i pity her then and you have reason for she is much to be pitied				1262.5468972076476
as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard				559.4597192193836
his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the window				47.151379933238964
peste i thought you somewhat corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward but i see you have other strings to your bow				2766.728242262576
never fear quarrels but seek adventures				39994.47433910382
the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty				965.7064971173319
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty is what you tell me true asked the wounded man				1.3027859745276982
there remains the valise added porthos				19.801955905788365
in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him				4.579688044340237
as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte				46.741364688992064
i recollect coming for my mother to look at it when m de saint méran advertised it for sale two or three years ago m				263.4441976178422
and what did he say to you asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo				22815.846818955655
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition				2715.6715450732922
bonacieux dead and d artagnan in a swoon				6939.639003772061
well morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart				38.57657972694323
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured villefort				402.5003324622974
madame said the president may reference be made to the count of monte cristo who is now i believe in paris sir replied haydée the count of monte cristo my foster father has been in normandy the last three days who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunes sir replied haydée i have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief				2003.9924412547045
near paris is it not very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil at auteuil said villefort true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken				520.4438806342762
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days to get married yes first and then to go to paris very good have what time you require dantès				963.32321091279
one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event				656.8554316434054
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing				40472.130223905006
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose				415.1309518275707
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor				868.1438457801287

well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it				5.7403515079617256
this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word				435.4090086412656

you see he said to porthos				80.7721380605918

why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that for a bullet may break a leg and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head				77.32886364472837

villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance				633.407024397446
the door immediately closed and d artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity				3273.4392134826203
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place				171.66583617526294

gentlemen he said the wood that i am carting is his i cut it in his copse and i am taking it to the chateau d artagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to planchet				127.92257152136749

presently they heard milady retire to her room				297.6151646325133
but athos might be said to bear a charmed life				2320.872888441918
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair				1164.5300555975969
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances and now i am convinced said d artagnan that this abduction of the queen s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration				190.74099888268432

pardieu monsieur said athos that s a proposition that pleases me not that i can accept it but a league off it savors of the gentleman				187.40795370119253
villefort walked to and fro behind them				17.106495191638313
at all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother in law with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy				1076.4422855014277

i think some one is coming mousqueton made with a low whistling sound the sign of alarm well known to the lackeys in the days of their youth resumed his place at the table and made a sign to blaisois to follow his example				979.0958868990197
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon				97.7993731111961
bonacieux came in and to remove all suspicion if she had any milady repeated to the lackey before her the latter part of her instructions				995.8972453372652
this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is as dantès spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of renée who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him				39.14641343454781

i i detest i loathe it very fine anne				1397.3441018767344
if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything ah maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both i will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and unjust				1494.2270352623364
the two things agree marvelously well i am all attention said d artagnan				1.005780100639942
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him				1.8367841759980206
in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation felton started and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan				653.1692728056577
so much the better it proves that we know how to keep our secrets i do not reproach you monsieur said d artagnan tis only because monsieur de la fere has spoken of friendship that i question your conduct and what do you find in it that is worthy of blame asked aramis haughtily				20.417944886787932

come gentlemen let us all propose some place				749.2937440354235

yesterday s affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him quite planchet was sent for and instructions were given him				12.991608337789227
i thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics				517.0967428317839
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels				61424.09832545529
yes yes replied dantès eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé				23.75607047144798
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol				544.0531766402921
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment				151.8333107689342
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each other we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m de morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m d épinay dear valentine that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eugénie as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed ah how good you are to say so valentine				546.266929688813
what do they say that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is nothing what nonsense said franz reseating himself				7.7730862471299975

they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them				8.051741357771105
50117m these last consisted of all the young people whom valentine s death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth				401.1816549239723
you are laughing at me i understand				41.74466565315052

it is fortunate for you although your name is bernajoux to have only to deal with an apprentice musketeer				696.3020316645778
bravo said athos that does honor to your imagination all very well said porthos but i should like to understand let us decamp first and you will understand afterward a moment gentlemen a moment give grimaud time to clear away the breakfast ah ah said aramis the black points and the red points are visibly enlarging				20745.4567535404
i am not going there to be imprisoned said dantès it is only used for political prisoners				2166.962663592578
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian				22282.897727754724
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him				2.4146134823482877
alas said d artagnan with the most sentimental air he could assume can you be cruel enough to put such a question to me to me who from the moment i saw you have only breathed and sighed through you and for you milady smiled with a strange smile				23.673041701861795

ah m de villefort cried he i am delighted to see you				3.8242048198075023
you think of everything said d artagnan and i thank you for planchet my dear athos raoul stared on hearing this name and looked at the count to be quite sure that it was he whom the lieutenant thus addressed				1224.8933458367596
but said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of kitty i must not play the fool				4706.215165914779
d artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use				11852.66660546791
dantès listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer				4572.6005575190675
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix				60788.37718063149
the cavalier laughed aloud which appeared to exasperate milady still more				230.6001532065028
i have acquired the bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country where barons are still barons by right of birth				2980.614020456518
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him				4.362277172712949
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our service then said tréville it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there the king looked at the cardinal				252.99109295065568
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove everyone listened eagerly monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak				127.42992486602877
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort				23.926881478117124

madame de villefort fell at her husband s feet				252.15803141633705

i have resolved to fly with you not a word be ready				467.41689360978097
the two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the louvre				610.5251663528172
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp				2205.9921640628536

this portion of the napkin was marked with half a baron s crown and the letter h truly truly said madame danglars all my linen is marked thus monsieur de nargonne was a baron and my name is hermine				6487.66206870084
no but it will be said caderousse as surely as dantès will be captain of the pharaon eh danglars danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness				14110.69717577859
he means replied the man upon his return that he got in that way and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through				1379.1587259601695
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan				661.160497277843
then no more of felton she would have cut your throat and after that everybody else s				1447.2072690109085
they want to arrest master broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs the crowd began to murmur and approached the house				46.48516654333765
i can not believe it murmured the banker				280.31309451642727
the former dantès proposed to augment the latter to remedy				11347.361101138547
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the abbé busoni and by lord wilmore by that friend and that enemy one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion that in no period in no case in no circumstance could there have been any contact between him and me but villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe				631.8956500706848
for a man not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous sea serpent of the constitutionnel wild eyes the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure said debray facial angle strongly developed magnificent forehead livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexceptionable just so lucien returned morcerf you have described him feature for feature				9105.565005132488
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion				4481.926717533216
uncertainty is still hope then in a low voice morrel added this delay is not natural				39186.514614677886
the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great				2289.2762558823074
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod				2971.9172055860513
but what are they to do				309.95446505790625

and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better friend than you and as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house				26.23612529335405

de chevreuse had been in paris but still further that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a cabal when he affirmed that he the cardinal was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about her the queen s emissary to the exiled duchess a musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king louis xiii				29.04972503277971

ah good evening my dear m caderousse said monte cristo what are you doing here at such an hour 40156m the abbé busoni exclaimed caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied				5889.280598066293
a quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion having been put in the right road passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the barrière saint martin				2240.2421827112044
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eye glass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a half official air without smiling or speaking				4656.658942943895

this double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hiding place and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming valentine at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl he crossed the flower garden which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orange trees which extended in front of the house he reached the step ran quickly up and pushed the door which opened without offering any resistance				117.6137542796671

and dauphiné sir inquired the king of villefort				111.18558188598897
are you going to rejoin your cardinal				156.07666489808625
the count s tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere				4.052640499096907
what tenderness my sister but am i not your nearest relative demanded milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness				4615.941423221473

you to be sure said d artagnan pressing athos s hand				43.015619808164516

i still had a loaded pistol and you were in full fight sword in hand yes said d artagnan but what if this rendezvous had some hidden purpose oh said porthos you can t think that d artagnan d artagnan did not believe athos to be capable of a deception but he sought an excuse for not going to the rendezvous				1492.5165828520146
and whatever might be considering the violent character of milady the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her				20.299200344548247

it was all up with him continued aramis ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly athos took lord de winter s hand and tried to turn the conversation				163.19789604530172
had not government better profit by it				14.034490086343432
besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond replied the old man				1.1288552299666157
from the top of an eminence d artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur				4149.748120305348
be satisfied said d artagnan laughing porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess coquenard oh monsieur procurator s wife or duchess if she will but loosen her pursestrings it will be all the same but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier and did you convey this answer to your guest we took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission so that he still expects his money oh lord yes monsieur				46.87750835277569
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on				195.16962214833057
m de tréville had spoken of her to the queen				74.19868909612346
speak i will listen in the first place said milady it is possible i may be deceived and that d artagnan and his friends may really come to your assistance oh that would be too much cried mme				59.330227548032425
oh yes i can see it all before me this moment was it not his betrothal feast it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a police commissary followed by four soldiers entered and dantès was arrested yes and up to this point i know all said the priest				212.14848983654693
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be patient				5201.327888950029
be said the letter on thursday next at from six to seven o clock in the evening on the road to chaillot and look carefully into the carriages that pass but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you do not speak a single word do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant no signature				2506.4757868968973
you would love me then if you were not queen				27010.25432752774
now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much				851.2558116462798
sire said winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are ready the king looked at the three gentlemen				4914.750091979638

milady was looking out at the window and pretended not to hear the door as it opened				318.55720026119144
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word				29.806372808484753
you give away horses worth a thousand louis you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty under the name of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome woman you think of and who has filled your head with all this nonsense why in the first place i heard it from madame danglars who by the by is dying to see you in her box or to have you seen there by others secondly i learned it from beauchamp s journal and thirdly from my own imagination				639.9350286348426
d artagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his wishes				1307.7614277131709
are you a man of imagination a poet				12480.407369819235
don t you say dear d artagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her i believe so at least in that case porthos will assist us and how so if you please why by your marchioness your duchess your princess				1120.4603038269456
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob				5067.555848742835
i didn t understand it all he said but i understand now how droll it is you think so				18.275858795893196
he was yielding to your infernal influence but i will save him				8.465555529153251
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning				5137.956470517008
neither dared for some time to speak in that room				132.67951943698836
he was less stiff than formerly				2716.040626085636
the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss				3534.655273967357
in life our greatest preoccupation is death is it not then curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their countries different persons bear the transition from life to death from existence to annihilation				12990.51003896944
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival				4505.488526981958
i am about perhaps to discover something here i am in the vein she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor				2453.201237927502
danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dantès father the whole brought up by fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile				623.2997852855981
i know who it is then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said i wish you joy my lord impudent fellow cried d artagnan you will get me turned off the gate groaned on its hinges and d artagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal				31.183651308310182
i faith colonel said d artagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast				1358.4820953427804
so much the better so much the better				419.4999696982809

go on with your affair monsieur cried planchet i have finished mine seeing this the gentleman drew his sword and sprang upon d artagnan but he had too strong an adversary				1349.0304110869195
at this last thought mercédès burst into a flood of tears and wrung her hands in agony but the thought which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her mind and then too old dantès incessantly said to her our edmond is dead if he were not he would return to us the old man died as i have told you had he lived mercédès perchance had not become the wife of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity				11490.343173576954
it is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the cardinal monsieur de tréville must think us dead to a certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be a general of the army				161.33804397201308
curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito and he was recognized				199.62128664313215
there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mother s admitted lover enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill nature				1274.66270590257
yes he is at work in his library but he expects you sir replied the valet				355.4258915171221

she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste her hair was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious her eyes of the same color as her hair were surmounted by well arched brows whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno				3033.6993781713268
these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect				12683.632542763295
light me m bertuccio and go first we will see where it leads to monsieur replied bertuccio it leads to the garden and pray how do you know that it ought to do so at least well let us be sure of that bertuccio sighed and went on first the stairs did indeed lead to the garden				273.02720900653776

tilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold colored silk embroidered with pearls while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue				1374.5937674955017
at the sight of the stranger m morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair				147.56100957194553

if you have two coats you will give me one of them				50.88122037560256

we will arrange the matter rather better				1054.319109832863
now monsieur de chavigny is not amiable i allow but monsieur du tremblay is considerably worse indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness				15205.082022002844
d artagnan entered after the cardinal and behind d artagnan the door was guarded				2538.606855714302
where shall we pass the night he inquired				371.4249980768678
it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan that is true said the king but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him				4.3701100372285895
at length an honorable peer morcerf s acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived				1907.4064117246305
taste the hashish guest of mine taste the hashish franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth				223.2943056904372
what is the use of boring one s self with so many things				1935.7621002310345
ah my dear fellow said albert rising and lighting his third cigar really i thought you had more courage so saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage				180.9734670316417
i am monsieur du poins an officer in the guards on duty at the donjon of vincennes mazarin perceiving by the paleness and agitation of the messenger that he had something of importance to say made a sign that d artagnan and porthos should give place				1362.2580300632778
the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest go sir replied the tutor but in heaven s name do not expose yourself to danger do not fear				425.64190915169183
what is the prisoner doing inquired vampa of the sentinel				152.6048740547371
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it not at all ah that gives me more confidence this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascon s soul				596.6215753538457
my sister sends you this authorization with great pleasure for she is very partial to the little girl to whom she intends to be more serviceable hereafter				2511.5113543683847
yes continued athos four times only once at the house of monsieur créquy another time at my own house in the country in my château at when i had a château a third time at monsieur de tréville s where it surprised us all and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman				56.28187907326786
there monsieur there is that letter cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice take it and deliver me from your odious presence the chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and retired				629.4723419902313
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says				1317.3717803086238
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze				4885.6921261576035
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in madame de morcerf s apartments				610.7758730684419
you wish to leave before everybody and at what hour at ten o clock and the queen at what time is it her wish to start at midnight then it is possible				160.51727441810633
adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat i leave you bearing a remembrance of you a remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for i am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn				4520.237641995443

the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake hands with him albert felt his heart bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so powerfully attacked				18127.809672644904
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself				51.20738502698113
ah you are his son he said that is a different thing sir i surrender said louvieres presenting his unloaded musket to the officer				6015.059972297913

raoul angry and at the same time uneasy ran after him and seized him by the arm				1008.1157179310752
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan				302.73265637567897
hold sire said d artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute				14099.572616419602
there was above all one room continued monte cristo very plain in appearance hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic why so said danglars why dramatic can we account for instinct said monte cristo				1.0035047530433352
estafania give up the keys of my drawers and my desks for form s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture named but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that the queen would place the important letter she had written that day				764.4370283457362
an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you can not grudge it to me debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie				120244.08245941556
that s well monsieur de tréville said the cardinal pray let that napkin be sent to me				4.62559331766171
there is still something else said he				7.516682556920932
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second				171.2486294933227
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england				60.291877170069036

i tell you so by the faith of de tréville how so you will be assassinated and i shall die in the performance of my duty but your mission will not be accomplished that is true replied d artagnan				1.0060803891456978
d artagnan answered with the greatest simplicity i came to paris with exactly such intentions				1518.3831128995862

hold your tongue stupid fellow said d artagnan and laying hold of the casement he let himself gently down from the first story which fortunately was not very elevated without doing himself the slightest injury				2398.350543833822
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening				804.4807119691125
at twenty minutes to twelve madame danglars tired of waiting returned home				227.5513195649973
d artagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth				929.162672777852
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me bravo cried château renaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism				6191.29069654649
he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present				604.5868348659216
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at d artagnan				1.0190534588774796
speak to the governor then and where is the governor in the country anger mounted to d artagnan s face he frowned and his cheeks were colored				1824.4427287280128
luigi vampa replied the shepherd with the same air as he would have replied alexander king of macedon				4031.916840866506
well penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head why i says i still think you ve got too much on i think you re right answered he we shall have a gale a gale				3470.370500465147

i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said beauchamp				43.26582539084638
now by way of having a resting place during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookery which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name				2186.0807094960255
that admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king charles i whom heaven protect from evil came into france i would offer him my house my own house but alas				454.1776003604139
you must have received a false report or you have gone mad alas sire it is but too true louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance				3641.5885684798286
the cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than ever				147.96163401931358
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids				24420.611606531424
i may have been mistaken at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew				4100.682455518722
why then have you laid it aside because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners sir replied d artagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks				619.9033150053166
the queen made a sign for every one except mazarin to quit the room and gondy bowed as if to leave with the rest				1096.5275345967934
luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind				103.31761104622304
a cup of chocolate i did not ask for it				12.525970591153822
at the sight of the diamond which was as large as a hazel nut la carconte s eyes sparkled with cupidity and what did you think of this fine story eavesdropper said monte cristo did you credit it yes your excellency				13095.00568132049
and have those who have lost their lives lost nothing m				378.5295264034508
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale				432.2293607967444
courted by my step mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed idolized by edward who notwithstanding his fear of the count s large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful present m				616.3254772020792
madame de saint méran had three successive attacks at intervals of some minutes each one more serious than the former				16054.928184527873
you seem incredulous said monte cristo who repeated to ali in the arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french				627.0678954749978
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world				81.76837946281847
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos				8.4002127777175
those fellows strike hard and don t leave off in a hurry				5007.652564022414

but how have you become acquainted with all these details asked the president				109.23343167852225

as they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio				1136.3989610328433
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors				12576.577164956108
the swiss became as purple as a peony				57031.813187110856
the officer superintended all these details with the same calmness milady had constantly seen in him never pronouncing a word himself and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his whistle				12843.48900761846
the procurator s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud all surrounded by duchesses and marchionesses who cast bags of money at his feet				39.39448949718344
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket yes said d artagnan athos is right it must be burned				4299.290187813245
andrea had then in a fortnight attained a very fair position				412.5020252955466
daughter of a prince i restore to you the riches and name of your father haydée became pale and lifting her transparent hands to heaven exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears then you leave me my lord haydée haydée you are young and beautiful forget even my name and be happy it is well said haydée your order shall be executed my lord i will forget even your name and be happy and she stepped back to retire				18724.09312053407
d artagnan saw those tears and much disturbed softened he threw himself at her feet				46.87573132789773
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil				55478.76676671694
the comte de la fere is not a man what is he then the comte de la fere is a demi god has he not a son a young man a relative a nephew of whom comminges spoke to me as being a brave boy and who with monsieur de chatillon brought the standards from lens he has as your majesty has said a ward who is called the vicomte de bragelonne if that young man should be appointed to a regiment what would his guardian say perhaps he would accept perhaps yes if your majesty herself should beg him to accept he must be indeed a strange man				87.3070244944018

tomorrow morning d artagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him				1.8078138956486278
amid all this d artagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos				298.82616110543137
what sort of a man is he ask the vicomte de morcerf you hear m de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess				61.99774934481352

you shall take him with you there				246.11368700448784
danglars alone was content and joyous he had got rid of an enemy and made his own situation on the pharaon secure				1394.0098950872905
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river that s well said d artagnan				1.0038813352269422
my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread then whispering to selim she asked what were her master s orders				384.0494543968434
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him				5.078713872969634
why this evening said the abbess today even				12490.576026474388

why don t we go in with them asked porthos				8.422934800985658
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush				2961.6269269725613
some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with torches				3081.755322129701
now then said d artagnan this is something like this is a means of communication				7635.285002281131
as the rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them they fired upon him and he fell struck by a ball which broke his shoulder				3746.8118480040107
they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them by chance that is why i have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa				334.2327722648258
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket				4671.644517343292

mine you have heard and that is to pursue you on earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of god you persist then i swear it before the god who hears me				4.164047032972812
monsieur d artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity				1122.0300399676764
i am brave when i set about it				5.871791137040453

by that means all our secrets will remain in the family insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword				122.95249923508247
what s that the lightning answered the captain our felucca so far so good laughed athos				12.347595544855585
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre				343.4369567954005
he must place his sister in one of these and we shall be in peace yes said d artagnan till she comes out ah my faith said athos you require too much d artagnan				1.0462088584392877
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry true said andrea				77.5402145752767

oh you are young while i am beginning to get old				7439.432347785461
he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary				374.47505369644676
lucien had found time preparatory to the count s arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars				4.725424582225635

andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge but after leaning an instant against the door and hearing the last sound of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his road and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues				2810.003075843988
his health hurrah but the means the means said fernand				495.35448036978045

i once possessed piety innocence and love the three ingredients of the happiness of angels and now what am i monte cristo approached her and silently took her hand				13.283036500806999

there were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled				2662.708897386554
oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune				623.2079533891609

it is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you				68.6107907189828
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on d artagnan but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face				36.937363665267135
you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss				20850.63922329769

i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now well nigh if not quite corrupt				1622.0547270962143
anne of austria deprived of the confidence of her husband pursued by the hatred of the cardinal who could not pardon her for having repulsed a more tender feeling having before her eyes the example of the queen mother whom that hatred had tormented all her life though marie de médicis if the memoirs of the time are to be believed had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which anne of austria always refused him anne of austria had seen her most devoted servants fall around her her most intimate confidants her dearest favorites				6095.483834848738

but pride restrained him and he did not utter it				6.215287250891425
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coolly such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely				2078.6361060644367

30341m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated				5195.106344967502

while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune d artagnan related how aramis being wounded was obliged to stop at crèvecœur how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner and how he d artagnan had been forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach england				603.8820898939617

excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m debray lives some distance from here debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do				285.2293546023085
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinal s directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman				8906.4589117999

it was six o clock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp				8032.736678971388
these 900 000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased				464.03293050778217
sleep well your last night as citizen i am to be a soldier then said the young man				1.1079621315641544

in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived athos and became thoughtful she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan				12147.557317197223
the officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the bastille where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading their muskets				1359.1514114809975
monsieur bazin said friquet monsieur maillard you know who he is he gives holy water at saint eustache well go on well he received in the scrimmage a sword stroke on the head				496.3811380743828
you are setting up an establishment of course why yes replied the count				9.481691296309748
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name				2136.8774488142203
the château d if cried he what are we going there for the gendarme smiled				39.22645294919466
everything said olivain to athos has been done according to your directions the horses are waiting and i was asleep cried raoul whilst you sir you had the kindness to attend to all these details				24218.64806786848
bonacieux he will rouse the whole quarter bonacieux called a long time but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer s house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac				2675.2459228969446
well baron i promise you some good exercise said the gascon				42.922373430757
the others my lord the second i heard his name by chance for before fighting us these four gentlemen told us their names the second was called the comte de la fere				3.783489129828778
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do				2170.81197756134
the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table				34.23359310602753
and where is auteuil asked the count				11.793531832379848
the man in the mantle quitted the wall and advanced into the middle of the street				75.77058462304788
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke				4969.071275207731
it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteur s carriage said d artagnan upon my honor i begin to think that heaven favors us he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman s little finger				191.61267138453917
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert yes you are right watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger				571.9823985535036
gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings d artagnan started off for saint germain followed by porthos				356.5115420315759
this child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor s orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden				581.3107087308675
the four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark				42306.68643087849
besides one must lay out one s inheritance somehow ah porthos cried one of his companions don t try to make us believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity				5614.715993959224
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke				13.131684087513976
your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not he said turning to d artagnan				1.0099484917210768
what is it the child conceals it but where did he find it in his mother s laboratory does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory how can i tell				388.8860615602867
he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged				30038.29503506923
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step				287.9853203274016
be more economical but when i have no more money left to pay you asked the infuriated danglars				774.1198625047925
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands				62.77398099792907
oh i can not behold this frightful spectacle said he				5.848912440482727
danglars then without taking a crown from his pocket could save morrel he had but to pass his word for a loan and morrel was saved				1616.45376988985
here is monsieur comminges said d artagnan returning to the cardinal				17.949440366109606
the cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for albert				1689.3020460611558
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind				61.608040456697225
monte cristo in taking the seat morcerf offered him placed himself in such a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a whole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted there				548.3178854600288
making no reply grimaud opened the poor man s jacket to feel if the heart beat whilst the host approached in his turn but in a moment they both fell back the host uttering a cry of horror and grimaud becoming pallid				13951.943012275437
explain it athos groslow on the question being interpreted answered three without counting myself d artagnan understood for while replying the captain had raised three fingers				8951.402527558728
any why not this evening this evening monsieur i am detained in paris by indispensable business ah young man young man some flirtation or other				713.10026866808
silence whispered the duke she has her reasons she will ruin us returned the prince				103.40499602368389
then all is agreed said she				48.79693080427666
there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce you with your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received				259.5881499289078
it is true i fought with tolerable success i don t speak of your warlike exploits monsieur said mazarin although they gained you much reputation they were surpassed by others d artagnan pretended astonishment				80.66063668299435
but make haste i can not stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it				14.76447600728
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation				1479.1578601193853
the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m de morcerf and is justified by his son				268.45986792566464
oh m d avrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m noirtier just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking and the same love for you eh my dear child yes said valentine he was very fond of me who does not love you valentine smiled sadly				124.15908919888244
it is not true said milady in a tone of voice so firm and with a countenance so unchanged that if d artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have doubted				9348.106394771077
suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the doors of the church opened				299.5573226588291
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks				408.7212527379665
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope you re preparing a pretty trial why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume i should think not indeed				131.57250735568599
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day				50.77279974453425
oh cried madame de villefort it is really frightful madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard				338.8301867279708
traitors screamed lord winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the plain				2357.069499407281
let me fight like a woman then my strength is in my weakness then as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could place upon her countenance so mobile and so expressive she made it take all expressions from that of passionate anger which convulsed her features to that of the most sweet most affectionate and most seducing smile				1968.5799987876517
morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say here i am maximilian come and help me he had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the clover field a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone without a servant without lights at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions				3640.6544810271434
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind				170.66251586704988
arrived at the staircase it was still worse				5196.57306606604
from that time d artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of mme				41.63827766148122
observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites				42951.69627872101
unhappily those times are past nonsense				14688.372002603084
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg™ license as specified in paragraph 1 e 1				2145.987819997204
in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years for change of air will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty				1172.7438798654002
ah this letter gives me an idea a capital idea				1579.657817706286
she extended her hands to him with a smile				299.55375167855243
a fine prize friend mordaunt we have both myself and monsieur du vallon taken two knights of the garter nothing less but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen i imagine i faith i don t know				48.54860681048435
that horse was to have identified us in the day of battle				87.33891984387475
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground				83.101918411322
the tie is even more direct it seems to me oh madame said villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the marchioness				7031.881656798046
at six o clock villefort retired to his study at eight m d avrigny himself arrived bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl and then m noirtier was carried away				133.7955265960718
the queen is too virtuous and besides loves your majesty too well woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal but if the queen be guilty let her tremble indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it				4.783730653873117
the man was one of those puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around cromwell				4922.766827387272
now i travel a great deal particularly on this road and i wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune it seems to me said the host that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur bah i have passed perhaps ten times through chantilly and out of the ten times i have stopped three or four times at your house at least				486.6048105196312
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it				7.603065935595992
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated				1062.745319989719
as to that said athos i beg you to believe that i care very little about it				14.446340800135028
dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions				13221.243280654173
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six o clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening				56.95595727596337
yes replied the man but at what a price listen friend said monte cristo				1.0055482388450174

sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance				1426.2692283132653
upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected				2571.7322451754467
on my word i almost regret that in all probability this miserable peppino will not be beheaded as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts and whether it is worth even mentioning but really this is a most singular conversation for the carnival gentlemen how did it arise				9972.344887779765
the pope and cæsar borgia first found the two future cardinals they were giovanni rospigliosi who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see and cæsar spada one of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope				18391.694663675717
do you know his house at auteuil certainly what do you know respecting it do you wish to know why he bought it yes the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments				15713.52714054546
i hope these gentlemen have theirs i will inquire said morrel				23.293815024646275
if there is an army on board it is not here that it is hidden				15465.028925172086
her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory				14456.554629103473
it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled				1494.1686111607512
a man of the count s temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common minds but which destroys superior ones				1911.8737512246325
the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of richelieu the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austria to declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter				445.6334893539119
he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize at first sight the italian or german nobleman				3800.353432627329

he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady her first attempts after her arrival				8347.906624524037
it was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in paris				136.1681935108482
i thought i had told you a most lamentable story and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his heart				21.249513876468516
m d épinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m d épinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort ah that would be a great pity said villefort				36.6321983983158
there was no time to lose				151.7016003579629
great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us ah monsieur stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i have had how sirrah				11295.611119786116

no it is not finished i feel it by what remains in my heart				27.315631369877202
horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen garden and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation				22229.17725013991
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on l impartial the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor				11913.522545718632
i have four harriers which are considered the swiftest in the county and a pack of hounds which are unequalled for twenty leagues around and porthos heaved another sigh				257.8778292779728

valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of every day life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body				1479.5775835293152
how many have you then asked d artagnan				1.0067464111653104

yes said grimaud with his hair standing on end				1145.487715024164

what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place				258.51446964186295

monte cristo pressed his forehead on his burning hands as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its thoughts				809.1855375249243

a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily				1088.947216342328
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room				6.090125922225339
take care of the executioner d artagnan all right				237.63650723083555

at the noise made by d artagnan in entering aramis lifted up his head and beheld his friend but to the great astonishment of the young man the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer so completely was his mind detached from the things of this world				206.45311830552484

grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort				49.66027162636052
yes returned the count i know who he is gentlemen will you return to the salon				996.692988436512
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless and how was m de saint méran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count				8.568531145650462

now one evening when d artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them				1685.1771790105183
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop				182.47123785622944

one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and pastrini s account of vampa s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them				36.32315392537928
look at monsieur mouston see the honorable wounds he has received observe how his habitual valor has given dignity to his countenance mousqueton was in the third heaven and would have embraced d artagnan had he dared meanwhile he resolved to sacrifice his life for him on the next occasion that presented itself				1187.4066250081848
as for porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them				23.269241861411352
what cried aramis and athos what				314.76678777659674

aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate				27738.89392959924

ah maternal love is a great virtue a powerful motive so powerful that it excuses a multitude of things even if after duncan s death lady macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience madame de villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him				5.685691235664464

franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so				15.186129100076682

franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet				4765.183929295116
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted				13922.329586074562
you have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend he asked of franz				181.03768180765974
these names are too numerous for me to remember them all and i will content myself with the first said the queen graciously				949.0396989979095
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them it was past midnight the next thing was to find planchet				562.3635640966934
and now my lord that i see how hopeless the position of the king is tell me with what you are charged on the part of my royal husband well then madame said de winter the king wishes you to try and discover the dispositions of the king and queen toward him alas				491.478508798496
at this instant the minister of police appeared at the door pale trembling and as if ready to faint				2442.1064971426536
the jailer continued now this was his project				2831.666810418184
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head				130.53945148851213
courage he whispered to porthos as they proceeded				1520.3537290140448
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man				11.39387470984919
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations certainly and that is why m and madame de saint méran have died that is why m noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to die it is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his edward				1487.1303118169437
in the whole house said friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is noon good said comminges				238.71611430441226
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him				2.489977428064026
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired				513.789505738158
there were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from athos porthos and d artagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them				25.386442192075783
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them				15.946835471317032
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair				339.2783460839159
albert seized it and as franz had no reason to suppose it was meant for him he suffered albert to retain it				5.867648764352882
i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me				17.743757837768143
i am not a priest you are not a priest cried the executioner				105.90438101332595
it was only to fight as an amateur				12253.075639603096
d avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man				1.0690357675711095
i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home yes yes				99.60534615310075
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars				1176.1286072207893
he who for so long a time had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possible that the accursed cavern might be discovered by the officers of the papal states who would release him that then he would have 50 000 remaining which would be sufficient to save him from starvation and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to him and as he prayed he wept				573.9588243411227
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given				780.788314962698
the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains				1010.4026277675185
during this time olivain had finished his bottle and eaten his pie the horses were also refreshed				12515.7832721351
d artagnan slipped into the wardrobe				12910.76189273095
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded				76048.90715435482
three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate				9605.138378819933
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof				3593.1576085973147
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty i encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty s service in whatever way you may see fit to use me the abbé d herblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii of whom i have spoken to you madame then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service				562.0445491614682
the cardinal s guards and m de la trémouille s people retreated into the hôtel the doors of which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering with them				8.539955869672863
the ancona road replied the baron				381.08765096201813
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain				792.6589904965346
however i had better find him out first since he can t want money				607.7651911167281
the men i have put to flight will return reinforced if they find us here we are lost				345.9216786272668
wait my dear father said the young man one word more say on however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing what is that the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house oh the admirable police have found that out have they				1576.855994605985
you are right athos said aramis and it is a rather difficult matter				835.2059147585286
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act				5566.534301127042
oh my god my god have pity on me without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m bonacieux lamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomed the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting				1560.9691429988354
you can see it in his eye				537.900432514245
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities				19140.064444019114
besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life thus dantès who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough and panted for wealth				4105.522865181184
now i repeat my father is named m de villefort and i am ready to prove it there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult				7833.521637078337
monsieur d arminges was already mounted				748.6069881621752
well what is it asked louis xviii				22.110738057465422
the inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote nothing to be done this visit had infused new vigor into dantès he had till then forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date 30th july 1816 and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again				340.9762608489809
the more so sir as it was men s and not god s doing tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything				232.82905347232085
he touched him on the shoulder				348.66702842138466
we should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed athos and yet it will not be the less said we were four men yes but to yield said porthos				6.199410385071791
i hate the english they are coarse like every nation that swills beer would it be better to remain here said athos and take a turn in the bastile or the dungeon of vincennes for having favored the escape of monsieur de beaufort				143.50968592688977
how should he have been otherwise				491.4759308978868
besides my lord must remember that monsieur de chavigny is governor of vincennes continued la ramee and that monsieur de chavigny is not friendly to monsieur de beaufort yes but monsieur de chavigny is sometimes absent when he is absent i am there but when you leave him for instance oh				264.5596712032272
a lover is never terrible he said				36.707666162149756
then assisted by bicarat the only one left standing they bore jussac cahusac and one of aramis s adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the convent				2005.154761120289
what could she have done to you				6.700399033303151
at the expiration of a year the governor was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham				2576.428341820483
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose suddenly				2470.582246902357
is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself				356.04673090719393
d artagnan seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard				846.7100245924873
everything said he to raoul shall be done as you desire but you will not stop to have your wound dressed oh my wound mine tis nothing replied the viscount it will be time to think about it when we next halt only have the goodness should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant to tell him in fact that you have seen me but that i have continued my journey and intend to dine at mazingarbe and to stop at cambrin				30615.123014592584
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians d artagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans				2495.733877585722
i have dined many times with him and the count of morcerf so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same drawing rooms come your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light that is all very fine benedetto mio but i know what i am saying				478.4666856477619
mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed				427.20310660344245
now am i at liberty to retire said the general				2204.4022659321295
each was anxious to gain admission before the other				41.13076344566128
good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her				11.78118888299885
well said franz to albert do you know what is the best thing we can do				105.07471504908757
why buy what one can take take said blaisois covet the goods of your neighbor				1430.3897629504547
i confess this staggers me and it has staggered everybody				11131.099284499918
the ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass				9167.12279920745
climb up said he to dantès				341.9753749445944
but please to observe i won back the equipage cried athos				5.815311491238848
is it not tempting what i offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only to do thus				273.91393455567834
how few to day exist plague on t my lord have you brought me here to get my horoscope out of me no i only brought you here to ask you returned mazarin smiling if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of musketeers monsieur d artagnan				1.3098044496700108
good evening comrade said d artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner				2922.8605889302626
danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty				1733.041122460245
though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country brutal politics i must confess said maximilian but don t attach any serious importance dear to what your father said				32.24586648333842
i faith yes said athos for i am hungry look out for the black fowls cried aramis				13.507318754017811
how delightful to see you again dear friend he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass you ve not then forgotten me forget you				2.7570876909783437
in addition to this after a half hour s conversation d artagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head				242.77336945864792
but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature				5086.230274306666
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped				2938.5933756484715
the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances but porthos urged the commands of duty and the procurator s wife was obliged to give place to the king				27.317357251212908
i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky it is not like this then said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain				1276.8362497284927
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection				3370.6758018069363
marseilles resounded with their well earned praises				7102.703887105328
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived beppo has taken in plenty of others and beppo led him outside the walls said the count				8.426604552619336
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell				266.003240627094
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count				30735.123085433424
he fancied himself a burden to the society forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed this society for a month and he set his mind actively to work				374.01945814287404
ah good morning my dear count said he				5.129872547650999
milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole hôtel				223.16848767443568
in the midst of the disasters that befell the house cocles was the only one unmoved				9169.588501529284
and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m de blacas and the minister of police i have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war fortunately sire said m de blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment do not mention reports duke to me for i know now what confidence to place in them				13.903878307706222
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no				425.31891645271133
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too				181.83778281573814
then all his suspicions were confirmed the road by which the carriage had disappeared encircled the forest				1244.1968479182342
the rest concerns myself don t be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis				11.587126144379306
i asked said athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure why how extraordinary said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment i understand english then				254.35079805127137
on his part aramis wrote a long letter				418.7990395939131
thus you see though born in paris i was brought up in corsica there was a moment s silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness				8610.261368148304
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather no no no replied the eye of the paralytic				377.69924988664417
you know the vessel is lost the pharaon sir they signal the pharaon				416.65876210304964
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that d artagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois				1234.088313246254
but you my dear athos you who so generously distributed the englishman s pistoles which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do i am satisfied with having killed that fellow my boy seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an englishman but if i had pocketed his pistoles they would have weighed me down like a remorse go to my dear athos you have truly inconceivable ideas let it pass				938.3257193010775
it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange				1577.6140955423152
answer me on what i could get you lie repeated the abbé a third time with a still more imperative tone				320.13767716562865
what do you mean by that				76.7245978237813
however amidst all the prisoner s efforts to elude a systematic examination raoul had recognized his natural accent				1399.6687747289523
oh sir said danglars after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the power of gold personified in the man before him three letters of unlimited credit				1329.356203547811
the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary				480.9012947898067
i shall follow the count s directions not under present circumstances monsieur perhaps you mean to disobey me yes monsieur i must you persist then yes i am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out				14.875429812128713
we shall go out all the same do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked what then why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at and what have master pastrycooks to do with us we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us				299.2804837782989
it neither increased nor decreased my income albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject				114.78152605793431
mademoiselle herself packed all the medicines which were sent to m de saint méran and m de saint méran is dead				107.52392642148516
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes				8.004124796462085
but beneath my fingers as if by magic in proportion as the fire ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the paper				412.97791122689256
do you love me still ah madame said porthos in the most melancholy tone he could assume when we are about to enter upon a campaign a campaign in which my presentiments tell me i shall be killed oh don t talk of such things cried the procurator s wife bursting into tears				545.9104484281447
athos said a word to one of the vergers who bowed and proceeded toward the basement				20735.962410330674
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to d artagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him				3.970901526071618
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them				11.123441809380646
all we have hitherto done in the matter has been child s play				2802.135417057193
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her good murmured milady the austere puritan lies as to the soldier he only smiled				1986.247078239847
gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings				39592.58653562538
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest				640.5581323333948
seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count				31.29570815436016
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron s pension that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers				88390.74534609346
steel is for gentlemen and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter s skull and crushed it				12.890980142088747
the idiot how so if he loved her asked d artagnan				1.005584478374597
answer sir exclaimed he you have been asked politely and every question is worth an answer i suppose i am free to say or not to say who i am to two strangers who take a fancy to ask me it was with difficulty that de guiche restrained the intense desire he had of breaking the monk s bones				29030.46609046639
and of what malady it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face the smallpox				19068.972082340413
provided charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must thank and yet without the man the king would have been rescued cromwell smiled				135.06053629643347
we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while i sleep monsieur du vallon watches ah				123.28484251425613
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression				660.6134221509327
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared				288.6460471462552
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke				287.39023273737047
he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men				517.0807159689679
whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered				682.1779101842294
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme				1381.1211858367333
the gates had opened of themselves and the king ostensibly at least had no other guard at his bed head but his mother				243.747034414259
could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coiners say yes monsieur you are right said the host				44.33914722727294
wasn t i right to part with the horses madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt				1417.2228097087793
for pity for mercy s sake do not deliver me up it is too late they are coming said eugénie				205.83090401683052
the door was scarcely closed when albert bent his steps to his mother s room and no one being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for one moment at the door				8.594336987648518
but tell me valentine how has it all been effected				4419.962832775684

but this sudden and factitious joy soon forsook the young man and was succeeded by a still greater grief				1088.6362297101434
noirtier fixed his eyes on her				7.681142441293761

the comtesse de winter with whom i had quarreled became reconciled to me at that ball				1622.1111903644826
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for god s sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us				107.93971902531787
d artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword				113.31042195583993
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him				1.7165862196352024

but d artagnan found in his chamber the personal equipment of a man complete except for the sword arranged along the wall				50.36099019235787
jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis				8078.400676623912

he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis				241.80313267399967
under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend you will help me to recover my spirits to morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent				2242.6566160491816

no i have good luck that is all				225.1737893956864
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them				18.342865955789573
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought raoul handed the letter to the prince				148.64468306684438

will you come said he to porthos				75.83922700390703

i certainly never will get drunk again d artagnan it is too bad a habit d artagnan remained silent and then changing the conversation all at once athos said by the by i thank you for the horse you have brought me is it to your mind asked d artagnan				1.0066825153673493

gentlemen said groslow i beg you will take your places				37244.621817353
his devotion and the compassion he showed for her misfortunes produced the effect they always produce on noble minds mercédès had always had a sincere regard for fernand and this was now strengthened by gratitude				1169.5596075147914
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity				2110.271750831206

ah that would indeed be infamous how did danglars usually write in a handsome running hand and how was the anonymous letter written backhanded again the abbé smiled				14.052346097398916

he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly				1778.6317408501736

my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to life partly on my sister s account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance				1624.6122397227616
one moment my lord whispered athos and he said something in a low voice				6.949857668136385
now hastily interrupted the jesuit on seeing that his acolyte was going astray now your thesis would please the ladies it would have the success of one of monsieur patru s pleadings please god cried aramis transported				392.1208232803659
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer				1102.9661012155818
but the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees				168.23718412539188
my dear athos i wish as your health absolutely requires it that you should rest for a fortnight				928.5935159814284
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding light without warmth				5936.1331144314345
raoul continued his way and was visibly gaining ground but the horse and its rider of whom he did not lose sight were evidently sinking				1841.107686556087

here he said here is a draft at sight and here is your fowl danglars sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had cost				4799.416825484708
he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock				4303.269146877533

they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady				92.168349505012
how are you to get away from here				701.8602446566597
the second operation was as successful as the first la jeune amélie was in luck				5337.414523448279

perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march if they are penitent said athos let them follow us well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemy s army at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle				230.82556872932483
for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind				227.12930171642208

what do you want sir said the king				28.1379338669381
look attentively then at this gentleman the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel				104.54341223007148
we do what we can and she rushed out of the room				27.352276019049974
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs				276.40987621155955
at last he heard the voice of la ramee				86.4428192890644
ma foi he said i prefer waiting till tomorrow				100.09685120872507
what i think of is that we have crossed swords as enemies				2459.5379040391695
sir said the queen to him thinking he was the leader of the band you wished to see the king and therefore i determined to show him to you myself				213.8142262388848
what does all this mean asked aramis				20.12396996572043
what cried porthos are we all going away then				372.7980008521045
bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight				852.6809369400761
did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty				331.9044878898967
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated				724.5158061725449
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain and the count de guiche follow urban and planchet and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest				4864.296740062146
on what was d artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling				5624.566398578553
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver general				442.35976919705365
valentine with her woman s instinct guessed that morrel would be monte cristo s second and from the young man s well known courage and his great affection for the count she feared that he would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him				7.398113199507342
the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters				683.248295269307
has not some sage said nothing too much				185.37390918600067
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed				238.0332100652834
the return d artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation				62332.09275921098
the council of the musketeers as athos had foreseen the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses french and rochellais				3205.87262162873
may i venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit said m morrel addressing the magistrate whom he evidently knew there is doubtless some mistake easily explained if it be so replied the magistrate rely upon every reparation being made meanwhile i am the bearer of an order of arrest and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be fulfilled				2086.5965362597494
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her				9.201800889808364
from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the fête exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight				2530.7218112464843
it must have been charming indeed				201.6867931790884
i was reflecting in the first place replied dantès upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained				13934.988669665216
and aramis said the duchess quickly				103.09969277378826
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky				4418.378199810289
make no noise sir unless you wish me to consider you as one of the men of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield				19876.569511119716
no monsieur jester replied d artagnan but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of god amen said d artagnan getting into his saddle				2058.2531624828107
the nails too were turning blue				3391.819494379741
leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me but you ll die of hunger said the patron				274.05137320859427
in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine s mind				114.16689416226224
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable				22094.25145800047
shall we return to the camp said porthos				11.218223974894848
my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty one				1189.3689939967805
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out				41.86311130667003
i too would give up that good monsieur broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean did i say dead or alive replied mazarin				20.56597497567714
monte cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep				2075.323282004176
it was impossible in daylight for the impoverished state of the habitation grudging charity had conceded to an unfortunate queen to pass unnoticed by athos aramis and even the englishman				1164.9888164703075
i thought i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle ages yes no doubt but improved upon by ours				5956.735697922591
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm				4110.337628913771
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house				17.514915724184014
eh he said negligently this money is not mine				379.6287211860148
what do you mean to say				213.22370670755015
you are safe you are free mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a miracle				4085.8174588887787
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box yes what do you think of her oh she is perfectly lovely what a complexion				2542.350064132653
who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection that is possible said the countess reflecting				2262.1598401658043
after giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me i have also sent for the procureur he will not come in time i feel my life fast ebbing wait a moment said monte cristo				1.0044175387307863
that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them				32.11358183667934
instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched				31640.134205508242
what do you want screamed milady				67.51539282336282
he wished once again to press the count s hand but his own was immovable				367.73478457444907
no where i can confess but perhaps you are not so dangerously wounded as you think said raoul				59.91889087365798
fine spoil captain fine spoil said peppino in italian and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling place				481.11551953119977
i will even venture to say that i am certain m de buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some great event				952.6932599533939
now planchet has an excellent memory and i will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to death				279.0866141568461
yes monsieur a most excellent sister married nearly nine years happy asked the count again				2107.942548340403
consider in short your people who love you and who yet are famished who have no other wish than to bless you and who nevertheless no i am wrong your subjects madame will never curse you say one word to them and all will be ended peace succeed war joy tears and happiness to misfortune anne of austria looked with wonderment on the warlike countenance of d artagnan which betrayed a singular expression of deep feeling				943.1294865093525
well said the other if this last resource fail you well returned morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune i must habituate myself to shame				327.40525989733504
well what is the matter the matter is that you have proposed to me what is impossible said rochefort shaking his head with an air of disappointment				14838.019394373288
d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen				4822.375274033656
i do not seek your confidence my dear friend				37.410666772676144
d artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with lord de winter and then returned to milady				269.6130341987947
certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied milady frigidly				613.3845369092602
his house has been full ever since				792.624596040064
we are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires				8753.179452567287
they still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top				2426.7673405070454
in your place i would stake the furniture against the horse but he will not wish for only one harness stake both pardieu i am not selfish as you are you would do so said d artagnan undecided so strongly did the confidence of athos begin to prevail in spite of himself				61.182726239024575
fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person				609.1619149870927
here are the horse s hoofs again it seems athos he said carelessly				736.2109714405776
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you maximilian whom i love as my own son				131.6466225805813
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling				671.2021755441802
did you come here sir to see the telegraph he said				13.646381147052416
by no means said d artagnan				1.0083855386505356
and then resumed d artagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following				3922.0741609012102
to troyes in champagne i answered				973.8488468061904
as he was passing the allée des veuves he thought he saw the count s horses standing at gosset s shooting gallery he approached and soon recognized the coachman				1417.1322574791666
i will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example				2006.7645776440224
but to return to what you were saying beauchamp well do you know why they die so multitudinously at m de villefort s multitudinously is good said château renaud				2058.826410023954
the house to which d artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening				31.549271036723624
i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends				3517.2604993830387
i my lord answered the gascon i differ from monsieur d herblay entirely as to the last point though i agree with him on the first				263.7994389860343
sir said raoul allow me after thanking you for that poor fellow s life to thank you on my own account				205.05122592313748
well my dear viscount said monte cristo i have an infallible remedy to propose to you what is that asked the young man				1.1378309698786582
but at this sort of work many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken				1582.0949192072758
i should affirm the culpability and i deny it said tréville				379.882416450892
watch her arrival for she has great and terrible projects				2978.069616964069
but what i know is that i promise to do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going and you will leave me then yes without waiting for my coming out again yes word of honor by the faith of a gentleman				125.58131198858284
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said porthos				11.646588158017078
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them i learned it all but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love forgive me replied morrel i will go away no said valentine you might meet someone stay but if anyone should come here the young girl shook her head				7.9499160081804705
what is that noise demanded milady				44.787368028709764
it is eleven o clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king charles i				35.4232712542057
aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud				1191.676634895244
will your excellency visit saint peter s asked the cicerone				31350.19748291981
a little sooner or a little later it isn t worth quarreling over if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened oh it will happen you may be sure said d artagnan				43.853549224588654
we must go and find lord winter they both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for				134.61901183793378
well this letter gives the count of monte cristo unlimited credit on our house well baron what is there difficult to understand about that merely the term unlimited nothing else certainly is not that word known in france				259.75184036346644
the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the bone				8432.650778773239
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with papers				843.0756830274058
no no monsieur said monte cristo				1.0070652963375788
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed unless said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects oh my lord my lord that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public but your honor will soon be called so generally i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak				369.3307630351268
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spin i feel very keenly fernand that this is charity and if it were mercédès poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of marseilles				247.5241091510825
but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses				5492.34556953261

the procureur then told his wife to come up				98.65642241938933

at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress				10305.595467684172
as for the count he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before him				2.3133155929202793

i still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myself no indeed you have then a repugnance to your profession so long as i struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly sheltered as i was by justice and law but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of god s creatures since that day the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair				239.45714874579622

now sir said d artagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier				4127.464076442563
he knew that i should arrive today at ten o clock he was waiting for me at nine at the barrière de fontainebleau				820.0668586612155

the queen saving monsieur de buckingham her lover nothing more just				2856.4626047740294
no i repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almighty s pleasure dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé s plans				885.4171613808487
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming				814.1892097124411
that is true said d artagnan let us call the others they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis				14.763905757979357

from that moment the old man s eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it				6.7848296304384625
and to you also m morrel my thanks are due				1167.3610338943904
just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of the east do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste albert turned towards haydée				4337.673658879752
according to his conviction she was some creature of the cardinal and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we can not account				4628.734025296911
porthos gained fifty pistoles from groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be				948.8360790178531

this movement was observed by mordaunt				323.0398739823805
villefort s impatience during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead and franz was stupefied				557.2421885006542
one may see that you love your family madame coquenard said the procurator with a smile that was almost tragic				11303.326745016187
and now gentlemen i repeat excuse me but on that account only and on guard at these words with the most gallant air possible d artagnan drew his sword				130.6121751375406

amongst the catalans mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any				1302.9574113001286
the day on which d artagnan presented himself the assemblage was imposing particularly for a provincial just arriving from his province				4182.271066979705
there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different key				1486.0372522348973
the chancellor advanced therefore toward anne of austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air and now it remains for me to make the principal examination what is that asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to understand				359.81519531071984
in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of god				923.250768885664
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of d artagnan and porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile				93.49915726969714
tomorrow this order will be sent to the duke of buckingham				398.1293007444318

edward cried m de villefort so harshly that the child started up from the floor do you hear me go the child unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or passion				3038.84198628226

the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between the rue cassette and the rue servandoni				350.05570817930095

i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china				1112.882214890055
a slight oscillation showed dantès that all went well				144.75930300906919

oh the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those days monsieur returned villefort i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation				14003.54421627059
at these words he gave me a ring				541.165943956619
you are the son of the marchese cavalcanti and the marchesa oliva corsinari				304.7953999928168
we are not generally very severe with the austrians				6665.0209253307075
de château renaud m debray and five or six other choice spirits whom you do not know even by name				2899.7054030497334

as to your rank an annual income of 50 000 livres will enable you to support it admirably				1036.2692295941183
porthos had forgotten that any other address was necessary in his pride he fancied that every one must know the chateau du vallon				29.16263675195458
that would spoil my plans sir said the gardener glancing at the sun dial the ten minutes are almost up i must return to my post				765.2806096736674
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived				9615.284045728102
oh no said he but help me to die if you can are you a priest asked raoul				75.62757178533309
villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin				277.78627846406505
i must absolutely see it i shall find a way no nonsense caderousse i will offer myself as floor polisher the rooms are all carpeted well then i must be contented to imagine it that is the best plan believe me try at least to give me an idea of what it is how can i nothing is easier				1185.9184533977934
but are you well assured sir lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all and when is this to be consummated to day this morning so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose to do what				121.01374806881945
it must be it shall be seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death				688.356261724806
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium				2794.1645419495553
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort				1.9942705638105362
really said athos to them you are not men but children to let a woman terrify you so				19.743481216714315
ah it is jacopo she said the captain of the yacht and she beckoned him towards them				14.128443310440643
i don t see what is to keep me here a glance was exchanged between athos and aramis				18.557408920110113
planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway while grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable undertaking that by five o clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready				883.0505224382351
at your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly				3125.805236287502
yes he appears to be a resolute fellow well he will do more than he has promised he will do wonders then the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs				65.88856567620064
you are gentlemen and i am a poor innkeeper				1073.979273604218
because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands and that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what i see it has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the future then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister we have not thought about it yet madame answered d artagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly i ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants alas madame exclaimed d artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us perhaps said anne but that idea if at last i have it your majesty will do us justice				836.1136376050205
his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him				3.1113278034665606
what undertaking can have brought him to paris				159.7271831602209
the duke walked so fast that d artagnan had some trouble in keeping up with him				4.582041656175512
well said he they likewise have refused me that dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than yourself he took a quill wrote the name of d artagnan in the commission and returned it to him				7.635923254755732
there are several branches of the d artagnans at tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal to which do you belong i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry the father of his gracious majesty that is well				342.40842757250704
ah madame said comminges hastening to d artagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector				2783.9334619364654
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him				3.608860500638518
but you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear not but cried the young officer speak then speak confide my shame to you cried milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another confide my shame to you a man and i a woman				372.86733523517165
0065m as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event				1642.0062981641784
you are placed on high my lord but tremble				655.1584465607508
tell me i entreat you my dear doctor that you may be deceived doubtless i may but but 30345m but i do not think so have pity on me doctor				2104.1665878688573
remain sir he added to aramis who had moved to leave the room				17.14425891791952
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precaution s sake				1202.9591844877275
he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias				1929.4550888736883
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen				223.46643563673123
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human				2379.4004988330275
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately				419.178839398335
no madame answered de winter but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies allies said the queen shaking her head				9.963398688980833
then i went out of the house i proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready				671.8627720969212
god who can read my heart all the gratitude i feel will reward you				4.339690366330892
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london the devil				345.3082854990727
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice s steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins				3394.395286075256
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared				181.95001631076724
i had been told but would not credit it that the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very box was the daughter of ali pasha it is true nevertheless then said morrel i understand it all and this scene was premeditated how so yes				651.9504406867709
well he thought of me when he saw the king was taken and as they were passing before the house he begged in the king s name that they would stop as the king was hungry				1402.8720176765626
his father and mother were catholics i believe his hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of de winter and what name does he now bear mordaunt a puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in france do you say as a monk it was thus and by mere accident may god pardon me if i blaspheme that he heard the confession of the executioner of bethune then i understand it all				82.46701030825817
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman a gentleman exclaimed athos				5.77357026865103
a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there				115.77729246607463
comminges so to speak threw broussel into the carriage and sprang in after him				2.6483525034750466
most likely said d artagnan i am one of his most faithful servants it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england yes a certain d artagnan a béarnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to london do you know him personally asked the governor				51.723334463882786
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers				16826.575624998688
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt				863.0834623768602
the king in return looked at the four gentlemen and drank with a smile full of nobility and gratitude				686.1678023418863
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest				1930.440698953195
from time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its whole width darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees and like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two parts				5244.572627612627
i will take charge of the inside one				149.59786331369003
be content i will depart but you will not follow me you will not watch me i will return home instantly ah i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man said mme				31.296327463184234
see said she if everything does not second us				77.93283443174087
53 yes i am vice president father your coolness makes me shudder why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a hay cart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierre s bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things				642.0635892186236
he was nay probably may still be a bonapartist and is called noirtier i on the contrary am a staunch royalist and style myself de villefort				9.180509818515464
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly				6379.5741624769125
oh i see you prefer peregrination				13121.983335935061
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down				197.32893459302218
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility				845.5097413132331
after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down				497.5992320763948
might not this young man be sent by his eminence				179.53755174487472
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy why cried the queen how is that because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity				580.1429706471224
the marshal recognized him and hastened to meet him				1.9286067022746198
he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two families that you should be united				1170.513087284998
here said milady rising with the majesty of a queen here felton behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl the victim of the brutality of a villain				8202.205773601461
the other drank it only by accident and although barrois is dead it was noirtier whose death was wished for but why did it not kill my father i told you one evening in the garden after madame de saint méran s death because his system is accustomed to that very poison and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another because no one knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve months i have given m noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection while the assassin is not ignorant for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison oh have pity have pity murmured villefort wringing his hands				26.123623831139625
was felton suspected by the baron about to fail her at the decisive moment				176.1344250674344

if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king no in presence of the scaffold as i am royalty i assure you is a very small affair but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his children				1047.2892295405682

adieu monsieur de rochefort he said				6.830371669840279
it is well sir replied villefort from below it is well have patience but one day longer what i have said i will do noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side				838.6843480169435
possibly continued aramis came toward me accompanied by five or six men who followed about ten paces behind him and in the politest tone monsieur duke said he to me and you madame continued he addressing the lady on my arm the doctor s niece hold your tongue porthos said athos you are insupportable will you enter this carriage and that without offering the least resistance without making the least noise he took you for buckingham cried d artagnan				1.0078771117466718

a barrier had been placed between dantès and his old friend				124.84245635461056
0313m two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht				1204.8357962445896
once thus ensnared unless the protecting hand of god snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction				1604.350959884864
he went to desire you to come to the palace				1598.7028805728903
at this time that is about half past twelve madame danglars ordered her carriage and went out				15.683455891902122

the letters were long the four pages were covered with closely written words				2607.6736956572295
she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited d artagnan s reply				217.62375501854723
which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume				964.4718065268715
it is impossible to form any idea of it without having seen it				7.433644533575431
my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open				707.6858458418087
women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris				52.453200868019145
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh				1169.280796013235

you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husband s father yes madame m de villefort spoke of it to me a paralysis i think alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire				1828.9067367475493
if he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride				1325.0875078596905
he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present				479.2101212826122
what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously				5848.032447701313
sir said d artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman				722.3363730283771
decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal				1159.5641540774675

john felton i put faith in your loyalty my lord said the young officer summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart my lord i swear all shall be done as you desire milady received this look like a resigned victim it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance				129.9519918324751
and with whom with whom can it be if not the duke of the duke of yes monsieur replied the citizen giving a still fainter intonation to his voice				473.5323096896668
but has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel				1194.9291006055994
well said the president your name i can not tell you my name since i do not know it but i know my father s and can tell it to you a painful giddiness overwhelmed villefort great drops of acrid sweat fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand				27.764609730335525
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre				6630.646236833768
then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand come i had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson i only wanted a murder and here it is				215.6697499945809

do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back				240.5356218985662
but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous in what respect are they capable of attempting violence d artagnan burst out laughing at the idea				12190.45033742628

the general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son				1527.6002566565226
we even joked very pleasantly if i remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest				686.9456470586241
but i think i have it said athos				9.324421523184146
the young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room				18.758590934824962

gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit				1265.9879611031597
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career				316.67602787565994
oh i wish it you with all my heart added caderousse with his hoarse laugh				277.14961732578246

my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not intoxicated they continued at their best speed for two hours although the horses were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse service				4870.944261532981
yes my lord it is i i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly and d artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking				2229.112252554449
a table with two covers bearing a supper ready prepared stood as if by magic in the middle of the apartment				122.07656127663628
yes monsieur said d artagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me i hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business speak then i am all attention it concerns nothing less said d artagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the queen what did you say asked m de tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon d artagnan				1.0072962044239846
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies				420.36620633472523
international donations are gratefully accepted but we can not make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states				75.32245499262402

he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling				663.5257442222971
a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot the day began to decline carriages were passing and repassing				5063.995328136811

monte cristo examined him with the same look that at rome he had bent upon the execution of andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward the abbé busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in 1829 he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities				1309.170250525874
there was no time to lose				151.7016003579629

all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos favorably				3026.5703391239726
then valentine s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds				4582.540823524087
how many people thought he and not one true friend and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said respect to fallen majesty the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart				599.1726423311272

my god at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened several men rushed into the chamber				69.12056105072107
but as i can not and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier s gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance				3407.349108338391
why much the same story but how could a poor catalan fisher boy without education or resources make a fortune				651.4050846959901
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tréport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion 30279m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars				544.1743414983641
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head				158.3288782245342
my very self replied planchet but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud proud toward an old friend				92.4219776124967

it is a little worse for the journey but that s no matter there are no horses albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand				203.39807976310507
now you talk my dear you pardon me we shall see said porthos majestically and the two separated saying till this evening the devil thought porthos as he walked away it appears i am getting nearer to monsieur coquenard s strongbox at last chapter xxxv				451.8765587208146
this time a small troop advanced consisting of from twenty to twenty five men but they were not pioneers they were soldiers of the garrison				1251.061565925569
the baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward				557.7408905777727
it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the hôtel des postes when chance brought us together you madame de villefort and her son i now remember having had the honor of meeting you i perfectly well remember perugia sir and the hôtel des postes and the festival of which you speak said madame de villefort but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count				24.334196156088737

they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy				976.1120125665173
the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance two soldiers said d artagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out fine looking men upon my word said d artagnan				73.99746939341591
monsieur de chavigny be so good as to lend me your cane monsieur de chavigny handed his cane to monsieur de beaufort				32.12654686453789

remember we are waiting for our turns speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities interrupted aramis				111.99677727918716
this time d artagnan was only in part mistaken he himself was not in question but his horse was				154.90504982065207
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage				11808.270358706506
i recommend you to sink forthwith to the bottom of the sea and if you come another fathom nearer i ll stave your wicked head in with this oar d artagnan				1.0345960862966317
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan				1143.5394001600505
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose				853.8331775115034

bonacieux with a half smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience				1266.6654601759244
felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall				38.85639886922312
having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of doubt yawning before him				4.941708914474047

but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf s or jackal s				451.4798344087074
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable begin with his father if you please said the abbé edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love the history is a sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it yes answered the abbé edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles at la réserve				89.57208808828779
it was the abode of the little abbé scarron				173.055297675474
my lord said d artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time				1107.6463077198098
albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress a jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat				359.1155144505094
there was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them				8.481191948002538
ja in the most german and the least gascon accent possible				600.5997352573605

all was over carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall				2876.6554670569785
no mother from this moment i have done with the past and accept nothing from it not even a name because you can understand that your son can not bear the name of a man who ought to blush for it before another albert my child said mercédès if i had a stronger heart that is the counsel i would have given you your conscience has spoken when my voice became too weak listen to its dictates				3758.9375579498974

what do you fear everything replied athos				7.634931121660058
now then do you wish for anything else said the patron				373.81762452351217
and am i not a hundred times better thus cried eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so oh you are beautiful always beautiful cried louise				1077.5890673170527
haydée had remained until the close of the meeting				1899.7155765522948
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo				1.0032885073923568
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway				1514.7882643010219
come my friends a moment s delay said athos our servants here we are they cried				834.9980503630788
it does not concern me you are right and if i have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the french captain or the count of morcerf but on the fisherman fernand the husband of mercédès the catalane ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit for i am the only culprit edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude but exclaimed monte cristo why was i absent				344.0353780974214
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her				32.895322640026876
no country can say it saw my birth				547.1449324182437
i am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives				3446.682146973009
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them				14.268799959912963
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes				4485.150697521134
impossible said d artagnan those beer drinkers are too clumsy and awkward				5904.284381478263
be so good as to mention this name to his eminence and to bring me word whether he will receive me yes or no saying which he resumed the proud and sombre bearing peculiar at that time to puritans				2445.4135487472613
but it has not been so with me i see and always have seen during the last sixteen years				31.97432244101359
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused				524.7801995731911
behold for what end the wretched mazarin has made use of you				22.544629407942345
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh				490.8302414754732
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of god s mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my father s tomb by your father s tomb said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of death				141.41458836471472
here we are without occupation it seems to me you forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of charenton i hope to see monsieur de chatillon whom i ve hated for a long time there why have you hated him because he is the brother of coligny ah true				215.7669550801915
mercédès read albert while showing you that i have discovered your plans i hope also to convince you of my delicacy				2678.2607213848664
now said gondy there is a communion between us				5002.569057862225
the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected something something had occasioned the noise and something must follow				349.80842076381316
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies				5858.124575813595
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand				27.658660509804
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger				2167.880417908636
and morbleu why do you not go yourself				176.9567279207863
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves				520.0402695399388
indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration				543.3806448035006
0173m will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell let us visit them all said the inspector				3129.862026775328
as d artagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish his respiration was broken and short				1039.621889347276
after me it will all be over and people will hunt with gins snares and traps				3047.4149419265927
athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind him				1.5510441292310273
the king saw the four gentlemen come in but appeared to take no notice of them				13.558597594780162
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot				216.65482853121816
and what will he promise us said d artagnan				1.0055327414634039
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass				205.06403498494166
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word				31.884790716829027
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him				3.447915077278511
d artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere				6303.163652693788
good evening valentine said a well known voice				126.51201405930072
debray had told you ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now then you are wrong madame				122.62298139957701

bonacieux who was to have paid him the price of his devotedness but let us hasten to say that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the happiness he had missed than from the fear he entertained that some serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman				160.30707859159403
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him				2.448989329218597
to be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward				534.686494717516

unfortunately the qualities of this horse were so well concealed under his strange colored hide and his unaccountable gait that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh the appearance of the aforesaid pony at meung which place he had entered about a quarter of an hour before by the gate of beaugency produced an unfavorable feeling which extended to his rider				1543.5301736144543
a quarter of an hour afterward the rowboat of this craft took them all aboard				329.94197864411876

the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès residing in the allées de meilhan and also a young woman called mercédès an inhabitant of the catalan village				2005.97337742443

i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message				4248.302412434956
my death believe me will not be the end of this atrocious misadventure where was the monk going asked grimaud				62.307392478816965

no hermine replied debray you can not make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count s				25.977053548926694
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner				260.52401014214865
not at all why just think for a moment with this red handkerchief on my head with scarcely any shoes no papers and ten gold napoleons in my pocket without reckoning what was there before making in all about two hundred francs why i should certainly be arrested at the barriers				36979.00162580472

those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents				7969.579367443071

i should never have thought of that said porthos and yet it is very simple come aramis said d artagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to marie michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the duke of buckingham mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing				2656.960927219696

on the evening of the 4th of september m morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study				904.8004863105533
no but gaetano did i thought gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone and if this person be not a smuggler who is he a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree what is his name if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be his real name sinbad the sailor yes and where does he reside on the sea what country does he come from i do not know have you ever seen him sometimes what sort of a man is he your excellency will judge for yourself where will he receive me no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel				381.1181805992676

yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is half the battle so added madame de villefort constantly returning to her object the poisons of the borgias the medicis the renées the ruggieris and later probably that of baron de trenck whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance were objects of art madame and nothing more replied the count				5740.4588109184515
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing decidedly my dear athos said d artagnan i should like better not to risk anything that s a pity said athos coolly				26.643121787590392

i will not detain you monsieur continued the countess i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate my dear count said albert i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready a thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the count of monte cristo but i suppose that m bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half i have given him and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door albert was used to the count s manner of proceeding he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count s orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house				23.772359733204905
the noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant				616.5021285334983
wait whilst i light the lamp said la carconte it is growing dark and there may be some mistake in fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half hour				91.70619859646648
the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage but d artagnan whose anger already excited was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos caught at his bridle and stopped him				1.9049270059859902

porthos told him of it in his calm manner				24.49140638300202
but will you not go up pass on before me i beg of you as the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant				110.75686344889668
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady s chamber				95.59828827807071
these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so soundly				169.6192748816886

the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture				342.6821825987366
they now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades				635.7869661077783

but rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility				6897.4644302255365
he drank to their good health and the travelers returned his politeness				1425.186243306008

athos was the last to enter				166.43708126759964
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said				14.673638151170882
the count told baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest who began by sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine				783.9212336135977
at present i confess that is the thing i stand most in need of buckingham gave d artagnan a chamber adjoining his own				228.64364794721877
as to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men the soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it				6.894536387072676
i said my good fellow that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included				741.5264010292535
the first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four friends				145.55050058288367
but be assured my dear monsieur d artagnan that if i had obtained them from any other source or if they had been confided to me there exists no confessor more discreet than myself oh i don t doubt that replied d artagnan but it seems to me that you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms a certain embroidered handkerchief for instance to which i owe the honor of your acquaintance this time aramis was not angry but assumed the most modest air and replied in a friendly tone my dear friend do not forget that i wish to belong to the church and that i avoid all mundane opportunities				2340.9480401539977
come milady opened the window and made a sign to mme				42.75032577390254
de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismounted				16510.470436094383
well but we should be taken out of prison madame bonacieux was released				5572.249351900165
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four but you are not one of us said porthos				8.765320381463297
d artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies				19939.165054366713
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model				2575.521841195867
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything there was a brief silence the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat				417.7762344115534
he says to you jauntily gentlemen there is fighting going on in gascony or in flanders go and fight and you go there				146.35167508242108
i find england a charming country and i stay but on one condition only what is it that i am not forced to learn english well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears us i believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again so be it said d artagnan but i i confess i have a contrary conviction our good d artagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye but in the meantime saves the country added athos				4.412617201909134
it does replied the abbé with the addition of an equal division of that part intended for the elder dantès which i believe myself at liberty to divide equally with the four survivors and why among us four inquired caderousse				32.423284728656384
often before his captivity dantès mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers				1053.0871153290236

he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before				227.0700673229551
he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future				1086.9888088741945
the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence				781.3410168726477
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work				1250.5432690709522
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile				553.0338421802671
and after this reasoning she slept easily				1846.1872364857425
you know said the abbé that i was the secretary and intimate friend of cardinal spada the last of the princes of that name				505.12230430751566
after this second part of his discourse fixing his hawk s eye upon poor bonacieux he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation				244.88873081613625
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room				22.33947803321819
a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy				2202.183373814494
another way of getting hanged so you refuse my request to be sure i do furiously the pretty landlady was desolate				1490.5123946973451

the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so				15.4106419680162
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century				3751.2524392229466
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tréville				2962.9730725314826
then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned but this proved useless for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six months				1124.457397905078
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out to night for paris eh cried the young man turning pale				71.14811508760764
yes that is a great word sir				40.68105017351795
the royal procession set out for paris				134.12046441126088
these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man				1.1202712034296456
ah monseigneur do not mention it cried the host in the most pitiable voice imaginable				287.7566325539221
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely				3746.3044825305924
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns				1931.2877501245393
but i repeat to you i am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up well he has then charged me to take it from you how				260.6976138155455
well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears i see that i am condemned to die no valentine for i have foreseen all their plots no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live valentine live to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart but to insure this you must rely on me command me sir what am i to do you must blindly take what i give you alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die you must not confide in anyone not even in your father my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked valentine clasping her hands				18.31352724174121
at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams				1442.0649630553712
he knew what were the rights of the great land owners				3837.0186200323933
if he comes to france will you accord him hospitality				12026.489369060666
never never the devil said athos				4.991914767932715
my father s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson m de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared				4.779893738837064
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation and in noirtier s name gave that order				859.7489553637711
you have an excellent memory milady but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace france the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great bitterness				975.7974214529565
who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him				2.9573528405345324
i would rather find it triply bolted and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth				778.6103727884648
the bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques rousseau you remember the mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger				928.0884324083601
athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte				986.0154160710601
how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands how i have called him in my long sleepless nights how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them				10.134487332874263
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man				1.179870840654527
that will be for another time he owed me for the councillor the pettifogger but said porthos if he was not crushed completely ah				713.1934437161065
speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed				49.88060281098932
in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance				151.68019012879614
d artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance ah said bonacieux they took good care not to tell me that and my wife on her part has sworn to me by all that s sacred that she does not know				67.83738844020527
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan				1.0125175710797827

at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness				254.87747219044834
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone				910.0195402499667
he then called for his horses drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget				12230.928392774273
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldn t serve mazarin				1912.1910325999734
be so good as to show us the way and we will follow you mazarin was by degrees recovering his senses				277.8731850414346
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel				960.2871196294831
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time sit down said the old man				1.1231880155816873
i know that i ought never to name the persons who answer my questions answered the child for if i do i shall learn nothing further at this very moment mazarin entered				52.7876929867976

large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companion s elbow directed his attention by his glances				1408.8006284854055
the only thing to mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things he said of himself				60.39264170379992
a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain				152.69469578876422
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered				4640.039601229609
it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory				529.9053482579155
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foot s pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles				228.78902551956494
how many men think you you could collect together to night two hundred muskets and five hundred halberds let there be only one man in every district who can do as much and by to morrow we shall have quite a powerful army				460.0316098385677
she looked at him in amazement				180.5308849203267
ah that said the prince i understand that language thoroughly and since he is italian i will myself continue the examination				578.7161914510247
these conditions being agreed to porthos took leave of mme				38.212046008010894
it is sacrilege to struggle against so many things my lord				8.093876962849093
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her				7.91490931337443
the anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer in spite of his efforts to suppress it terrified his sensitive inamorata				26012.345281368413
if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival				1286.8567367482935
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent oh i take everything on myself				88.643775554617
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master				105.40320515065879
i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london and i say to you live sire it is the will of heaven the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked				2845.6519528436447
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see				569.0402815926445
for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this house i will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man				1.1278269275465436

guémené was reading aloud and everybody was listening to her with attention with the exception of the queen who had on the contrary desired this reading in order that she might be able while feigning to listen to pursue the thread of her own thoughts				230.249871110928
debray paused a moment before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his mind how to act whatever it might contain				3490.3749146029822
oh said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me d artagnan bah				205.88224172962134
but all i know sir is that i am ready to hand you over this sum in exchange for your assignment of the debt				6023.056099055144
this cost me on your account and mine 100 000 francs				412.0418161804089
we were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the place royale said the wounded man				1.11382019405557
at this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of raphael s picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object				730.8615005998804
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution				2073.662423223557
it would be no doubt parbleu if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower said athos				69.45359002373755
but after he had gone about two hundred steps d artagnan stopped short alighted threw the bridle of his horse over the arm of planchet and took the pistols from his saddle bow to fasten them to his girdle				1386.0124639874498
no he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket and took from it a paper folded in four and after having examined it in a manner almost reverential he said good				403.9360066008855
d artagnan seized the hand held out to him and kissed it ardently				20591.63235057759
monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison				1485.7892637061295

but we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is indispensable for my own part i demand it said aramis				20.951786775796606
two large slabs of marble on which were inscribed their names were placed on either side of a little enclosure railed in and shaded by four cypress trees				640.8511181183472
i will in the meantime go and prepare the young man for this much desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself i should quite imagine that to be the case said cavalcanti				1002.1448221254587
all i have is at his service the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching gaze there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper then observing in the countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent you are i presume m caderousse yes sir answered the host even more surprised at the question than he had been by the silence which had preceded it i am gaspard caderousse at your service gaspard caderousse rejoined the priest				198.5014251914426
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him				1.5691708165703213
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him				1.5762596026665845
under that pretense you run against me				2.7097408254833346
and he is dead yes well sir said d arminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not exempted				6257.285902427756
had he better deny everything or tell everything				117.76768952334636
i am betrayed on all sides				136.86928890658962
planchet had no need to learn more				2433.8874351834356
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived but have you only two days of leave raoul on the contrary sir i have ten nor is it to the camp i wish to go where then said athos smiling if it be not a secret				103.59134827304437
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof				2338.2527305599087
we can find out his well that s all very sensible athos said d artagnan				1.0044951436887475
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot afoot my lord i have served always in the infantry				76426.1038207206
porthos is in picardy then aloud and he has taken his ancient name of vallon to which he adds that of bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my troth so that porthos will be a baron i don t doubt it				15.680277870756418
yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the money				226.19310988414256
from madame de montbazon he cried				38.75646618763641
there were but three hôtels in this part of the street and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied the other belonging to aramis himself				159.6786741514454
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fère all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said				269.6985411612393
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brows				754.4298190535061
since god himself dictated those words to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god edmond continued mercédès with her arms extended towards the count since i first knew you i have adored your name have respected your memory				316.0772641555148
thus they applied very curtly to the salutations healths and jokes of their companions				211.45062262926822
comminges had arrested one of the ringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of du trahoir but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were attacked in the market place with stones and halberds the delinquent had escaped to the rue des lombards and rushed into a house				19.093786982118502
there are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which are highly becoming to beauty				398.6283303863668
planchet took place behind his master and kept at a distance of ten paces from him				2.2220175761696646
but said madame danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate but this is trampling on the weak sir the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us is not death in my house oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture				51.78457343069854
this announcement was received in silence				1162.0394652259592
now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellous that which we do not understand				135.01604192648233
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer madame cried mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last he has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle but in case he is beaten well madame in that case my advice i know that i am very bold to offer advice to your majesty my advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom				1216.3357295853782
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away				51.37880193480972
monsieur de tréville is ill so my company can t do without me there				310.49321233830403
lord de winter d artagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her				6.184590675377075
villefort after having received m de salvieux s letter embraced renée kissed the marquise s hand and shaken that of the marquis started for paris along the aix road				342.63120446830766
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open				357.4794619443025
the king made his entrance into paris on the twenty third of december of the same year				228.23690786716872
i searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years				139.89681206161623
a gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world even to a man void of uneasiness but for one who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming				1913.8685750879913
you are free to night without fighting so much the better				313.3961341621408
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so i know too that you are a good marksman there we are about equal				15383.46378660828
more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp and in a separate group might be distinguished m de busigny the dragoon the swiss and the fourth bettor				2364.5341294336663
each time he had been brought into contact with his father something terrible had happened				325.82090722109376
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward				593.1560487428809
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion				869.0227203535559
i want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the king s throat a man in a mask cried athos				3.5985386414696774
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same				83.85095761810435
alas said milady i know it is so				33.43289579894291
the two guards led in athos				210.8038977095643
with respect to aramis though having the air of having nothing secret about him he was a young fellow made up of mysteries answering little to questions put to him about others and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a princess wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor				5448.330644898255
the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past				273.0897071274656
d artagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake				952.5288249498694
what does he mean asked a gendarme				156.41953631152623
we shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance my good edmond answered the abbé be not deceived				195.42245488077475
a torrent whose bed was dry led into a deep gorge				21685.514792023318
i bought my experience dearly particularly fair women				425.1277116290342
well said porthos what do you want and why do you not let us listen to the end of the conversation hush said athos speaking in a low voice				3.028022959158871
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors where i know not but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d emery and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant				1587.152195201673
monsieur du vallon and myself came from france with him it appears too you kept him waiting a long time at boulogne what would you have				188.43620557980472
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul				423.72601171785914
d artagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and d artagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what i should say to it as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a hunting hound in his old master s company				773.7759106031676
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m andrea cavalcanti s solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration				2674.9244767311247
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes				80.63321794624021
hold your peace porthos don t remind me of it tis that which has made me so cross since yesterday				282.1529723395413
the cardinal was lavish to his underlings yes yes guitant said mazarin richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect				2779.7921435836433
it is a quarter of an hour s journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hour s journey from the city to hither				1456.1409308554573
if the letter must be written under your censure my faith i renounce the task and you will do right				451.22501203298134

after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon				997.6753599275822
immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it				4.8238524585005615
he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word				47.918371433754146
oh i am very presuming i am aware				456.93244655250913
milady smiled and d artagnan felt that he could damn himself for that smile				368.8659475961115
the young count s conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long				670.961218039786
everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror				451.0843187743226
the guide carried away the torch				1142.8024163770683
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the banker s family in which he had been received as a son and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in mademoiselle danglars				22.340069243314954
i know that porthos was in a fair way replied d artagnan and as to aramis to tell you the truth i have never been seriously uneasy on his account				199.57883782329435
athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms				4657.755983347336
you hear madame said the king who enjoyed the embarrassment to its full extent but without guessing the cause				208.5751913749721
there are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or the issue of an event it is to these powers we should rally i am sorry for it madame but i acknowledge no other power but that of the great man whom i have the honor to serve you serve the cardinal yes madame and as his servant i will not allow you to be concerned in plots against the safety of the state or to serve the intrigues of a woman who is not french and who has a spanish heart				424.90295825137497
they are fed on thyme only your hares and how do you like my wine asked porthos it is pleasant isn t it capital it is nothing however but a wine of the country really yes a small declivity to the south yonder on my hill gives me twenty hogsheads quite a vineyard hey porthos sighed for the fifth time d artagnan had counted his sighs				2862.898803593195
she had succeeded d artagnan was then in her power				511.8584267909722
i enclose a draft for 5 000 livres payable on m ferrea banker at nice and also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo whom i have directed to supply all your wants				1074.4658913772334
quite contrary to the lot of monsieur de conti unable to be cardinal he was obliged to remain a soldier				844.9978698321621
yes monsieur it is here he lives the servant replied to planchet who was not in livery				7283.479298484911
depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and earth a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlet s stood on end and racked with fury he cried out silence sir				300.0731331844969
a bottle perhaps a whole bottle				927.5685852683504
he was we repeat handsome young and bold he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return				1082.6885711130014
he jumped from his horse threw the bridle on his servant s arms and joined them				14.026943352450077
but at pont neuf he found louvieres and his bourgeois				15929.775055305976
on one of those immense staircases upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house ascended and descended the office seekers of paris who ran after any sort of favor gentlemen from the provinces anxious to be enrolled and servants in all sorts of liveries bringing and carrying messages between their masters and m de tréville				6.636231582082731
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by d artagnan				1.0103964801627305
where do you keep your wine no no thanks				830.5347249624732
you are not convinced yet i hope at least that you may be mistaken shall you see the king again perhaps would you pass in his eyes for a prophet prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man well what should i say to the king say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble				3897.8703370266308

but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida				3324.186225195277
dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty				615.4949252034374

villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination				755.3376295141695

they found raoul near his tent reclining on a truss of hay of which his horse stole some mouthfuls the young man s eyes were red and he seemed dejected				179.36188005425808
i really never heard a person speak as you do because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us why should they not				407.14663098464234

caderousse then was as usual at his place of observation before the door his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted road which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill voice of his wife and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her chamber first taking care however to set the entrance door wide open as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be passing				507.76880977283474

has morrel whom we know been killed				415.46403705372694
of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful				383.82207545335257
signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied				213.4775317675417
how madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the king s safety				801.6370892061564
come come where either to seek the duc de beaufort or the duc de bouillon and to tell them about this yes but on one condition that we begin by the coadjutor				344.6877619534878
you morcerf replied the secretary resting on the stairs				52.92221502655692
but formerly it appears began mousqueton timidly				42.703079216194865
we left paris each with seventy five pistoles in his pocket shall i see you again before your departure i think not monsieur unless something new should happen well a pleasant journey thanks monsieur d artagnan left m de tréville touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his musketeers				420.69386310064687
while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years				160.03273978679843
athos had been out since six o clock				1.1970171887391399
coquenard who knew that a simple minded procurator was a very rare variety in the species smiled a little and colored a great deal				350.2146516824758
bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life				215.22358084064862
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment				106.29155698133509
he approached the duke took his hand held it for an instant in his own and letting it fall all is useless said he he is dead dead dead cried patrick				292.431730467527

while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from athos				47.020382086847995
consider by becoming a gardener i effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger 30053m i beseech of you maximilian to cease trifling and tell me what you really mean simply that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which i stand was to let i made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now master of this fine crop of lucern				1735.0437671586349
you said that his majesty king charles my august consort had been condemned to death by a majority of his subjects yes madame chatillon stammered out				13.354795757793175
ah mate said caderousse you are getting on better terms with your old landlord faith yes replied andrea whose hunger prevailed over every other feeling				733.1358706017668
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the king s bed ready to die for him laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst d artagnan glided behind the curtains				3460.495482562893
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother				137.85242109345415
that is the least we owe her that s true said athos but that concerns aramis well replied the latter blushing what must i say oh that s simple enough replied athos				5.781623741985883
can he have and she stopped				429.59067311655247
i see spots of blood on the ground and he set off to follow the two friends				61.13653175825817
messieurs porthos and aramis repeated athos you who are her judges what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman the punishment of death replied the musketeers in a hollow voice				4.194173873081782
the king saved we shall assemble our friends together we will head the puritans reconquer england we shall re enter london place him securely on his throne and he will make us dukes and peers said porthos whose eyes sparkled with joy at this imaginary prospect				699.3066605660563
athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not d artagnan				1.0127353664106187
do you still feel the same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion				651.711111495586
well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly				125.69352076755267
for women have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me				3.721515219003087
countess returned franz totally unheeding her raillery i asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian lady opposite i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her husband nay answered the countess i know no more of him than yourself perhaps you never before noticed him what a question so truly french				609.2691082297397
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another				81.99421006962034
how were you to blame in that affair listen when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive everybody pities you sir and above all mademoiselle danglars poor eugénie said danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life no alas it is unhappily but too true				98.88460947350539
château renaud and morcerf exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder				1132.470653814537
i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house				149.71161264652605
corbleu i am more your friend than you think for after our very first encounter i could by saying a word to the cardinal have had your throat cut they this time embraced heartily and without retaining any malice				3960.004326223121
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he re entered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment				69.53616926439119
i am a friend captain groslow cried mordaunt				653.3499419082558
madame said he with dignity there will shortly be a ball at the hôtel de ville				25.6049622105714
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father				131.26951534155776
the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it				27.01076692111421
the handsome madeleine announced to d artagnan that planchet had returned bringing mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit				141.63607256795342
where is this lemonade asked the doctor eagerly				8.347637138125174
are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison no my lord but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted and what was it that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes you believe in sorcerers then you fool i i mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my lord giulio who cares about them as an italian he is superstitious the duke shrugged his shoulders				16.111654997396318
when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan these words produced a contrary effect to that which mordaunt had anticipated				1190.4192249068967
you must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me				5.069728775102023
i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile as though in mockery of my words				183.7957755725282
but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me				21.830003518215243
moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart				184.2637579683209
those imbeciles of magicians can only imagine things to torment honest people and what did you reply to his most illustrious eminence that if the astrologer in question made almanacs i would advise him not to buy one why not because before you could escape you would have to be turned into a bird unfortunately that is true				77.70414571048921
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champs élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light				269.92356037798857
meanwhile lord de winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of buckingham s household had all made their way into the chamber				155.86841911869215
a light yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of night over the immense lake extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles and from tunis to venice				77.67628743305583
all hands to the pumps i shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in				68.57644733401439
did i not tell you that she was the goddaughter of monsieur laporte the confidential man of the queen				43.818119396368544
on y va coming exclaimed peppino who from frequenting the house of signor pastrini understood french perfectly in all its idioms				5374.476774111522
words might be heard at a distance through all these open doors				883.3988170742094
i will so advantageously bestow 2 000 piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for peppino and during that year another skilfully placed 1 000 piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison and do you feel sure of succeeding pardieu exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french				322.9436149421227
but do you happen to belong to him monsieur d artagnan replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority				3278.622370402207
how hot you look my good barrois said valentine				30.7250753326443

the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him much more so would be that of the king				77.4058933845822
shall i complain of him demanded the inspector				36.999537362848415
where in that box no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize i am sure of it and who afterwards sent the cup to me undoubtedly but i don t know him said the countess i have a great mind to return it do no such thing i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby				2141.2470603216107
in his arms he held the child whom no skill had been able to recall to life				227.82708904104504
how did you manage to escape that scoundrel mazarin				347.27855850013447
how do you mean yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars				5.305185407298116
do i turn to the right or to the left hand to the right said caderousse				21.83552117453295
grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and double locked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure				652.7710428223478
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter				1.9835682379645063
these would just have suited them				48.91801720677144
she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and madame danglars was recognized				170.89606829116912
the queen at last asked him if he had anything to add to the fine discourse he had just made to her				10.822784061376577
buckingham threw himself at her feet and before the queen could prevent him kissed the hem of her robe				103.2083975403956
has anyone brought a letter for me asked d artagnan eagerly				13.480246290544393
20293m it was the end of september the wind blew violently				439.0606866512837
every soldier must be ambitious must he not				141.8827308580269
athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions				167.9491941843197
that was not the appointed hour				171.07454214482382
it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption				8235.698370804575
20053m maximilian my dearest brother she cried				66.6056942669202
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you wish me to do so yes well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron by whom are you charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable				1185.3395330024593
he took to his heels and was soon at m de tréville s but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m de tréville s office				28.72732166330567
as he passed by m noirtier s room he perceived two figures through the half open door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further				2569.0480554182914
the bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor ship owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources				1651.1784719041696
this circumstance pleased m de tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m de la trémouille s testimony and himself				33.168124133292125
when his patience was exhausted he called his valet				1761.2829972289526
what do you wish to say about it i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified to what do you refer				1543.8209259492212
well now that everything is decided cried porthos rubbing his hands suppose we think of dinner				1860.3609914771066
it wounded the pride of the parliament which supported by the citizens replied by declaring that cardinal mazarin was the cause of all the discontent denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from france within a week afterward enjoining in case of disobedience on his part all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him				3.8701593575707682
gentlemen said he you have heard the comte de morcerf s defence				1137.5532034870096
one of them went away and dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement				4825.618641922356
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality				471.70147680809686
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london				159.60749844114184
advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down				100.1433509267651
you are the offended party count doubtless what does that imply that you will fire first i fire first oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that and at what distance twenty paces a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips				47.3020236413413
i come to ask to be your captain said the young man				1.1142516142884287
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips				1282.86213989021
i don t believe that monsieur de mazarin thinks of cutting off our heads for heads are not taken off without previous trial a trial would make a noise and a noise would get the attention of our friends who would check the operations of monsieur de mazarin how well you reason said porthos admiringly				677.3150329022315
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friend you can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction				192.7771176715919
all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off				135.49097450700168
this probability afforded him his first consolation				343.3534475637146
this strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your reason				341.11969552244574
come planchet let us pay a visit to the king s treasurer and then set off toward paris sir toward paris and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain				969.8116701799564
about half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of greney				1418.0251929621925
the journey at two o clock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrière st denis				57.35394003679609
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation				925.5455068132521
come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m noirtier de villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being not of providence but of fate				1437.5597859899697
for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the king s attorney but can you not say that sir				208.28974808830904
sir said d avrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him his blood has thickened				2078.4834713449136
ah is that you d artagnan and you athos said the young man				1.1093634381170216
when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door				33.46319941360933
50039m oh the magnificent hair said louise with regret				631.4537809215503
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward				2030.8602529508944
that person is here madame said the officer leaving the entrance open and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect				251.7158223681629
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours				123.77362169222359
you see it is yourself who have first named her you her father have pity on valentine				177.445960523538
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house				29.501507853940787
goodnight and before dantès could open his mouth before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoner s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon				56.07844523289242
both got into albert s coupé and as the young man had no reason to conceal where he was going he called aloud to the opera in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance				3416.244837058997
well then the place will the place royale suit you asked d artagnan				1.0058363677841868
you say you fear nothing but death i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans and old age my end will be achieved before i grow old and madness i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom non bis in idem				1378.978545980026
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place royale				28.43127676790966
m bertuccio lay covers for three he then took franz s tablets out of his hand				17.02466056302913
m de tréville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m de tréville hastened to report himself at the louvre				481.4611407327293
in the corridor he again met the pretty kitty that was the name of the soubrette				176.54408753840195
if you arrive safely at home what have i to fear except from you if you reach your home safely leave paris leave france and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well i will send you a small annuity for if you return home safely then then asked caderousse shuddering				57.79459481779707
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye				135.93192347010182
the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerf s are you not no replied madame danglars i am too ill you are wrong replied villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen there do you think so asked the baroness				36.313949389845995
the count s tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune				74.92401283298211
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily				376.5609291287043
as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse				864.0701003234867
a customs officer was laid low and two sailors wounded dantès was one of the latter a ball having touched him in the left shoulder				490.69872519149243
devil take me if i ve ever been so happy as at this moment and he wiped his eyes still moist				3522.349327774606
no one had a more searching eye than the cardinal de richelieu and d artagnan felt this glance run through his veins like a fever				923.4480175956281
ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the bishop of noyon good said d artagnan to himself				3.414179978411037
they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for them a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one				577.1233768920409
here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will				1029.4289107700642
he forgot the necessary slowness of navigation he exaggerated to himself the power of milady				161.92656732288722
i promise you he keeps a good watch over the prisoner				153.96062853414705
d artagnan however who had consulted with aramis spoke to the poor wretch				565.0412875074142
i had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held				695.94188022808
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him				2.635191865706458
as all this however bore some resemblance to a duel d artagnan began to recover himself little by little				473.9836686711733
he will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to take				238.69357728304612
besides they felt that the dénouement of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make				74.22685747248583

ah continued the count be good enough to ask pastrini if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an account of the execution there is no need to do that said franz taking out his tablets for i saw the account and copied it down very well you can retire m bertuccio i need you no longer				426.85531786224607
albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother he threw his arms around her neck				564.0377347161971
but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it				5.437245499540417

to save a man to spare a father s feelings or a mother s sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and i thank god that things are thus and mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them				14.97901910336888
at five o clock albert returned delighted with his day s work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome				27.819387919972346
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence				3603.005714907741
the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged				4010.7436374368917

13 paris now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address noirtier repeated the abbé noirtier i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria a noirtier who had been a girondin during the revolution				395.91243602052845

count to possess valentine would have been a happiness too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this world since it has been denied me but without valentine the earth is desolate i have told you to hope said the count				8.138289546682065

d artagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast				99.36331848264902
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded				2060.7033414076222

noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead				1290.0447591329835

his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule				1661.7578955393856
madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers				1548.1348988385646
