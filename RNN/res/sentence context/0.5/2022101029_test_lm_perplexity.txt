powerful memories were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower fort saint nicolas the city hall designed by puget 28 the port with its brick quays where they had both played in childhood and it was with one accord that they stopped on the canebière				1396557.5504705098
this time it was not a host but a hostess who received him				3.041409015450335
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith				179.09489445748227
let us try him my friend said he slowly i wish as the son of an ancient friend for i consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true i wish i say in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in my reception of you to discover to you the secrets of our policy				964443.3859121301
she saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing				210.20765886418215
the thought was maddening and dantès threw himself furiously down on his straw				1163849.0242167828
a tent was erected for them near that of the marshal				3438.0481370611474
the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure				857.7833964320449
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz				221.53897336656527
danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart				1954.6486476370371
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him				3.9639784022995634
now what would you say to an ensign s commission in my guards and a company after the campaign ah monseigneur you accept it do you not monseigneur replied d artagnan with an embarrassed air				52.19012760188117
it is the hotel rambouillet cried guitant				207201.19182080534
whatever you say sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house and do not do such things no the commission i ask is quite different name it sir i beg you are the inspector of prisons i have been so these fourteen years you keep the registers of entries and departures i do to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners there are special reports on every prisoner well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared suddenly				22467.58305922505
as soon as the door was closed sire said aramis speaking rapidly you are saved the london executioner has vanished				27053.512508809577
mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears				12128.260775869745
you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money				511.18352181004536
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse dantès whose restless anxiety concerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him hurried back to the abbé s chamber and raising the stone by pressing his head against it was soon beside the sick man s couch				31432.974205412975
the count appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his toilet				43291.419242201715
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another				715.6212965501484
besides the woman wore that black mantle which d artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer				1264.2903726205932
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him				5.571451757799109
people fight for all sorts of reasons you know i fight in the cause of honor ah that is something serious so serious that i come to beg you to render me a service what is it to be my second that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get home				1573.3185028918656
this famous invention of yours must i tell you replied the duke on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first yes that s the thing my lord cried his custodian gaily				917288.6470864767
the rowers waited their oars half lifted out of the water like birds drying their wings				4293.901905932728
i will write a letter today to the director of the royal academy and tomorrow he will admit you without any expense to yourself				435.7463127974063
what these happy persons took for reality was but a dream but it was a dream so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the holy herb now before you had given them a slight foretaste then cried franz it is hashish				94316.59747830445
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look				344.4255432916814
women weep for the dead men avenge them oh yes cried d artagnan yes				709.9084058089857
and what do you know about them monsieur				296.73999325671656
three is just my number now then who are you asked the englishman				31.805449464310605
ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps follow me monsieur said mazarin				26.402777413383713
and he took hold of one within his reach his two companions did the same thing				2187.0691323617702
do you know what has become of athos asked d artagnan of planchet as they galloped on				500.45253171685994
he was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal s bodyguard but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings the house was now being searched				1086176.4963046445
but as to what had been done by porthos and d artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau				1031.513780358803
that s true replied d artagnan i have not the uniform but i have the spirit				142529.43920506307
it was m de villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house of m de villefort				3.7560753749423745
but the most fearful spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed his face expressing all his meaning and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty				1119543.432857419
morbleu cried the latter i should say that i do pledge myself to it				62.901984962574716
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around				1352.7310512633135
what is the matter then with this dear child				612.4726636258202
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans go my dear boy said old dantès and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son his wife said caderousse why how fast you go on father dantès she is not his wife yet as it seems to me no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond				350.2854648730332
as d artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been seen				771.7396933223683
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer				35198.393524841464
well then speak that which i have to say of her can only be heard by yourself my lord leave us patrick said buckingham but remain within sound of the bell				1662.1612699364064
here are two other cavaliers as he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed				408.18739865997765
thank you sir answered the young man much moved				1559.9311505812586
was mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen				93.2066551311849
milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will				314.43016033689463
are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain				1258.7153882287691
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur				2138.2911896125397
but how can lord de winter my protector my father asked felton possibly be mixed up with all this listen felton resumed milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures				275379.02537238493
it was just two o clock by albert s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing room				14.64557581984145
he motioned to valentine to approach				27712.08267038165
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes yes said monte cristo i think m danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a side glance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugénie is pretty i think i remember that to be her name very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful fellow you speak as if you were already her husband ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing				286.2812709743927
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a plot				13253.232516064953
you are then some secret implacable and mortal enemy				1630.930351959293
his recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnestly				36643.84591461777
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of god s anger ah indeed said monte cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilian s face				35.518597709521295
you said only imagine and then paused				4053.8899259512937
the officer desired to have milady s packages pointed out to him and ordered them to be placed in the boat				342.30884548841817
he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors				1258136.4469651214
felton give me that knife and at these words as if all her strength was exhausted milady sank weak and languishing into the arms of the young officer who intoxicated with love anger and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown received her with transport pressed her against his heart all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom				10446.881981462539
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois the only serving man whom he had left				1314.3656442447482
now that i have the word of athos i can set out d artagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queen s presence				736.0803914002323
everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future				2088.444011967695
the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion				1592.1702141322953
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you				4.708084980692141
the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room				10.770532022938998
ah monseigneur continued bonacieux throwing himself at his eminence s feet ah how truly you are the cardinal the great cardinal the man of genius whom all the world reveres the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as bonacieux did not the less enjoy it for an instant then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy man the cardinal has touched me with his hand				5265.661707816836
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said				81.47484350056008
if you can be satisfied with my dinner it consists of cooked tetragones and fruits what do you mean by tetragones asked d artagnan uneasily				1904.1013460354177
are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort				1.8653194741496057
confess you know i have the right of giving absolution i monseigneur said athos				8.247589522360522
penelon replied julie go and inform m emmanuel of this gentleman s visit and maximilian will conduct him to the salon then turning to monte cristo i hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a lateral alley				1387866.3446717856
in the first place he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell besides				442462.3372377298
for a mind so perspicuous as that of d artagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future				931.8772672082587
on the ground floor dining room two drawing rooms billiard room staircase in the hall and a little back staircase windows magnificent windows so beautiful so large that i believe a man of your size should pass through each frame why the devil have they any stairs with such windows luxury has everything but shutters yes but they are never used				487.57706335827186
in three days m bertuccio planted an entirely bare court with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different parts of the house and in the foreground instead of the usual paving stones half hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that morning laid down and upon which the water was yet glistening				1254349.4244578728
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow				75.65202579874476
you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations				395819.97977330827
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged				369843.4598188198
at last when pistache was sufficiently well trained monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment				185.70904508664404
it is a veritable army my faith yes said athos there they are				393.36657413361536
the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair do you really think so				21.357425116362915
that the king has forbidden your lordship to have any pointed instrument are you mad la ramee				66.75421088838083
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh				364.6227711979913
monte cristo carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa				103802.4948962251
he is really king of paris he can t go out without being mobbed by his admirers ah				796.6642105933124
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box				4008.2925980907207
nevertheless had caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of bellegarde as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist				1172.8081905324448
adieu sir one word one single word more doctor				5622.0887743501535
in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution this order to heat the irons made dantès shudder				375.28786331828724
providence still murmured he now only am i fully convinced of being the emissary of god chapter 91				316360.1668182927
you are born to good fortune said franz as he returned the letter				106.34991000542635
he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running				507113.37056804675
yes sire yes it is the same and your majesty has a good memory come how shall we decide said the king				25.3966125959024
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me				6.9678375259282905
these steps came on came fast				6859984.264340914
i believe this man paid his predecessor a hundred pistoles for his the rascal is rich then some of those men sometimes die worth twenty thousand and twenty five and thirty thousand francs and sometimes more hum said gondy laughing i was not aware my alms were so well invested in the meantime they were advancing toward the square and the moment the coadjutor and the curate put their feet on the first church step the mendicant arose and proffered his brush				340662.15156378376
mademoiselle eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel				432548.77380037034
a gascon a match for cupid chapter xxxvi				245211.60813621024
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				1825.0918358877454

your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects				26859.36906013271
she stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen why then do you always weep mother when i am away from you she said				11.196673785073726
ha laughed the apparition every gentleman seems to have the same fancy for not a quarter of an hour ago a young lad well mounted like you as tall as you and of about your age halted before this clump of trees and had this table and this chair brought here and dined here with an old gentleman who seemed to be his tutor upon a pie of which they haven t left a mouthful and two bottles of macon wine of which they haven t left a drop but fortunately we have still some of the same wine and some of the same pies left and if your worship will but give your orders no friend replied raoul smiling i am obliged to you but at this moment i want nothing but the things for which i have asked only i shall be very glad if the ink prove black and the pen good upon these conditions i will pay for the pen the price of the bottle and for the ink the price of the pie very well sir said the host i ll give the pie and the bottle of wine to your servant and in this way you will have the pen and ink into the bargain do as you like said raoul who was beginning his apprenticeship with that particular class of society who when there were robbers on the highroads were connected with them and who since highwaymen no longer exist have advantageously and aptly filled their vacant place				970.7795820344579
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen s carriage				431.50530970504235
in the morning i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus				748031.8556454178
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated				3860.48744885312
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting				1523216.5385399133
you will find mine on my saddle already loaded mouston breathed a sigh he couldn t understand visits of ceremony made under arms				325.29201345639586
milady that woman so courageous and firm shivered in spite of herself				2575.586931557687
i swear by my honor as a sailor by my love for mercédès by the life of my father speak monsieur said villefort				10.710156054748612
good to eat he said and put it in his pocket				70.49762312782755
did you fancy yourself dying no i had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you might have made your escape the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dantès				1594.511806973778
don t worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to smile it is nothing it is nothing i was giddy that is all another attack of giddiness said morrel clasping his hands				26.109837886968833
how strong one feels here said porthos almost burying his large feet in the sands				1778156.1810228566
the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination				9658.451438553057
as morrel and his son embraced on the pier head in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event a man with his face half covered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentry box watched the scene with delight uttered these words in a low tone be happy noble heart be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds 20064m and with a smile expressive of supreme content he left his hiding place and without being observed descended one of the flights of steps provided for debarkation and hailing three times shouted jacopo jacopo jacopo then a launch came to shore took him on board and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a sailor thence he once again looked towards morrel who weeping with joy was shaking hands most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a look the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies				1820707.6352586066
come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune it has happened and i really can not pretend to lament it				6.301552261766971
as you will replied the duke				12.110437316342
my house oh your excellency it was not yours then whose then				726.4994765139547
it was the voice of a cavalier mounted on a magnificent black horse who was charging at the head of the english regiment of which in his ardor he was ten steps in advance				6704.239567865551
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence				1264.9717886965711
why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair he took care not to do so monsieur on the contrary he came up to me and said it is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not i since he knows everything and i know nothing				125.71839639537606
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden				1904.1104255198127
i was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me				9.825405956222246
albert with his eyes closed was standing grasping the window curtains				8008.397551454086
he my thief replied d artagnan				1.0065363644075225
he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german				27287.754955344048
at the end of this time he gave up his search and gaetano smiled				91.92387673970889
i only speak that exact truth and you say that one of your friends lives in that house i say so and i repeat it for the third time that house is one inhabited by my friend and that friend is aramis all this will be cleared up at a later period murmured the young woman no monsieur be silent if you could see my heart said d artagnan you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity				942.6632429989504
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me if so let dinner be served in her apartments				1973.6187647097663
i have looked at it with all possible attention said dantès and i only see a half burnt paper on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink this paper my friend said faria i may now avow to you since i have the proof of your fidelity this paper is my treasure of which from this day forth one half belongs to you the sweat started forth on dantès brow				290.5565521787211

so thought the gascon here s a young blade who has already his love affair who doesn t at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex				1430775.3177045297

decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg let each one pick out his man i cover mine said d artagnan				1.004634976467364

the carriage creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough stones and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the road and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror				644.6982803360787

the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings				2519047.2860275107

apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that i should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether i am as he says too old for action and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make d artagnan shudder but d artagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said go demon do what thou wilt				321081.4265133511
and what favor pray asked lord de winter				1.794107001156468

your eminence may be certain of that the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately				226.06382596687888

help no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue				851.5708564020554

the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this dantès declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed s head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself				2233.2881340367444
a deathlike silence oppressed all nature				3351.8944085715802
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder				398.3832015536012
the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yew trees monte cristo recognized him whom he sought				163007.98871929472
you are welcome monsieur said milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill humor which d artagnan had just remarked you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail				47908.22060959554
i heard the chevalier d herblay say so the fool cried blaisois i wish i had been in his place thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures				10689.412133467269

bonacieux moved by a double sentiment love and curiosity				3986.4031840335215
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect				27689.046771176952

the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother				233.14845929970105

to the boat but porthos i do not see him porthos is coming he swims like leviathan in fact porthos did not appear for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward				6148.507762791161

this glove wherever it had not touched the muddy ground was of irreproachable odor				43007.686736538504
to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when d artagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure				3760.9348232019206
i go to morrow my friend replied d artagnan				1.0069112777719593

how was it that a presentiment did not warn mercédès that her lover was within three hundred yards of her				18.871679574031948
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheard of that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs				764105.4676983543

friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others				599.5859182429151
emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight				1273.1301320703212
after all continued d artagnan there was certainly one with aramis				422.3621627472129
he showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers as he felt some self reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice				22400.061877868076
the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which d artagnan occupied with authority				3271531.1062473864

nothing will ever go well with us hereafter oh heaven				1903.2008763188323
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne				37627.37695681906
mercédès was much changed within the last few days not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery no the change in mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit				36582.00826197304
you must try to see her and have an explanation with her				37.452584651684504
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the count s agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides				456632.56481009827
but nothing could be farther from his thoughts				266.82999899763905
as they returned toward the castle d artagnan thought of the miseries of poor human nature always dissatisfied with what it has ever desirous of what it has not				329.3217437062422
