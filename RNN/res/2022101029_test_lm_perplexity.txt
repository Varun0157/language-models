sir began raoul with his usual politeness are you an ecclesiastic why do you ask me that replied the stranger with a coolness which was barely civil				630879.301879835
the dog sprang and in spite of the height jumped lightly over it				19.219547283493718
monsieur de chavigny who at heart detested the cardinal took pains to tell the story to two or three friends who put it into immediate circulation				781749.9107341027
he was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty times beheld the image in his dreams a coffer long and deep locked bolted fastened in the wall a coffer of which he had so often heard and which the hands a little wrinkled it is true but still not without elegance of the procurator s wife were about to open to his admiring looks				234870.10848444788

d artagnan remained for a moment motionless asking himself where he could be but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen s apartment				227.6982826702024
during the night between the 4th and 5th of september madame morrel remained listening for every sound and until three o clock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation				7126.4513298376705
more than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal whose police without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police were excellent being better informed than himself even upon what was going on in his own household				118719.26967682377
a great age you mean monsieur porthos				79.0173187577682

a vast crowd filled the apartments of saint germain				392.9080409680376
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan horse with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the others and come to the winning post in such gallant style i actually clapped my hands with joy				1115.4839108948358

this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible i will try to accompany you said aramis though i scarcely feel in a condition to mount on horseback				1666.5683001618847
madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm				3836.1587888501326
at the moment he re entered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was doing				600.271910187962

my friend you impose a painful task on me				52.58109094542052
i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much				1473.445268830262
the general s carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went				7469.696283547246
franz continued it was as we said the fifth of february				4149.938085046953
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge s door and which merits a particular description				16248.160441049853
that gentleman your friend defended himself desperately				1815789.9655288188
in the year 1811 i was transferred to piedmont in france				347.18120210046527

god would not permit such a crime water water cried d artagnan				1.0175223351259952
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne				1047.9086518087636
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist				10036.325795351046
in ten minutes d artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt				43807.11378735761
die in peace i am lost murmured milady in english				1133.1690943905253
it was precisely at this moment that m de tréville on leaving the residence of the lieutenant criminel and the governor of fort l evêque without being able to find athos arrived at the palace				1778.6198672419391
my heart is that of a musketeer i feel it monsieur and that impels me on withdraw young man cried jussac who doubtless by his gestures and the expression of his countenance had guessed d artagnan s design				118432.49190667462

he went on his way				134.4672207520282
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it				13.18815397125585
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coolly such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely				31454.654920047087
athos did not move				537.8488803111353
then d artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house and this d artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle				27448.192015924436
oh said she seizing the count s hand and raising it to her lips oh thank you thank you edmond				410.71772948122765

i have come therefore to discharge this duty and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude and as he said this the eye severe of the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance				2685706.5518459384
encouraged by this discovery edmond determined to assist the indefatigable laborer				1044928.3990100205
sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison				1785.9958838465266

now sir you have but to say the word and i will spare you all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two firms the blow had struck home and danglars was entirely vanquished with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the count who held them carelessly between finger and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with a minuteness that the count might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present purpose to mislead the banker				120181.94537818032
one of my friends one of my friends please to observe not myself said athos interrupting himself with a melancholy smile one of the counts of my province that is to say of berry noble as a dandolo or a montmorency at twenty five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen beautiful as fancy can paint				963053.7035742116
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans				374669.4172602325
he had not done so for ten years before				341.7764915890614
listen i am the only man in the world having the right to say to you morrel your father s son shall not die today and monte cristo with an expression of majesty and sublimity advanced with arms folded toward the young man who involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man recoiled a step				304.76110220840064

eh egad to give up broussel as they demand				12940.370806911502
then the count knelt down by the side of the bed which death had converted into an altar				816368.6487644291
it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption				953250.0064022415
how did you penetrate hither				28348149.897473
felton did not enter				678.8751522347329
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect				647196.6224655076
again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with dantès request he began to speak of other matters				1483.8754771319436

how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know but without doubt m de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home				2104.347197686585
athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him				844.723924307482
i stumbled over some object i stooped to examine it was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet				996595.6604462838
your affair is not bad said athos after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man				136.70335703185629
yes sir he said				2.807126814277298
edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray				1315098.6317997251
monsieur d arminges who was at the door perceived his hesitation				23971.741214270554
aramis suffering at once in body and mind had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts upon religion and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double accident which had happened to him that is to say the sudden disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder				119.95481102231439
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each other s prudence how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine				429.70745051930083
do you see this firman i do said my father				6472.860834046628

the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually				2234233.1275423015
there was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti				914071.5583599564
the door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and beard				504903.69821530854
on the summit of a rising ground a little in advance of the enemy appeared a short and heavy looking man this man was surrounded by officers				4103.616541357675
and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study				1619.797034886529
he saw that he was on the highest point of the island a statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam				5798.694629356656
five months after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercédès arms				472.0475380186691

when luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded man				1.942705237942855
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night				226.79694448790744
no object affects me and i even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for you				5.627688575896883
but he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the spaniards are ranging through the country and i shall die without absolution				14167.721784238372
the streets were crowded for it was the day of pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle				576.5122199381457

in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental d artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance				2365.6912251322574

0065m as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event				885.5712777202081
but i must not forget one grand point which that i have been singularly assisted nonsense i have indeed by circumstances no by you by me				25.929636759729537

nevertheless it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and frank				744763.1827685324
sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction				12811.291366964093

if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery				9338.928402763908
but what could these men whom i at first took for robbers want with me and why is monsieur bonacieux not here madame those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been for they are the agents of the cardinal and as to your husband monsieur bonacieux he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the bastille my husband in the bastille cried mme				22.189043836180396

that knife which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of because he knows the use i would make of it				8.010058090536067
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings				1542537.759934318
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy				2477.7174702785223
haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear				2902.084600706146

on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres				779849.6192752736
do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do				1116.1756006894143
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man				5.465506315221863
you want me to throw again do you not no i would wish you to reflect on what you mean to take your horse without doubt you are wrong then				98.89757708415675

if i had wished to widen the breach between those whom monsieur d herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder i could have spoken out what are you meddling with cried aramis pale with anger suspecting that d artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with madame de longueville				1081.477056553507
for one second d artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d artagnan recognized the coadjutor				350.4829489474371
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors bah				1673.462876438074
toward midday lord de winter entered				174.41117337412254

through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley				887113.579381217
after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have done i inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly				215386.32614875134
sir what a cook must monsieur pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating and drinking even whilst he was only called monsieur porthos say no more cried d artagnan				1.0227774384735593
then athos raised his hand and pointing to the coffin this temporary sepulture is he said that of a man who was of feeble mind yet one whose reign was full of great events because over this king watched the spirit of another man even as this lamp keeps vigil over this coffin and illumines it				193.28252984807355
i don t speak of my brother				371.6205781533748
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure				1927199.745107894
oh it was cruel to us and dare i say it to you also listen my friends said the count i may call you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years the discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know				298.0416375518134
it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it				21.194504617400206
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke				674.2598752696283
you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself 20125m teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felice s daughter				2610.2787503967616

his soldiers formed a legion of devil may care fellows perfectly undisciplined toward all but himself				1539.8941449406543
30297m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need				11369.513044776237
taste of this it is a spanish wine which our friend athos thought much of at that moment the steward came in to consult his master upon the proceedings of the next day and also with regard to the shooting party which had been proposed				1705.806744554549
yes i shall pay if as i hope my vessel arrives safely for its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents of which i have been the victim have deprived me but if the pharaon should be lost and this last resource be gone the poor man s eyes filled with tears				191.4072035319715
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercédès has declared she will kill herself if dantès is killed caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès				95.99331970113701
gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances gentlemen m noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m franz de quesnel baron d épinay he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect				1767658.1832335142
which route must i take demanded d artagnan in his turn				51.041675202799304
still as five o clock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner				440.42448072623307
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke				3378.6282643034633
it came from my brother the king of spain				1397.121573530288
i am very sorry for what you tell me said the governor replying to the assurance of the doctor that the old man is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching ah added the turnkey there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty years i ll answer for it without any attempt to escape still said the governor i believe it will be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that i doubt your science but in discharge of my official duty that we should be perfectly assured that the prisoner is dead there was a moment of complete silence during which dantès still listening knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time				518.5975748307212
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell and are you going to leave me at such a time this very instant and where are you going ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service ah me				203.17086745015507
do not cast yourself against such a rock he would break you like glass that will not prevent me replied d artagnan if ever i find him in the meantime said tréville seek him not if i have a right to advise you all at once the captain stopped as if struck by a sudden suspicion				2327.5169175609176
i believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it oh yes they will only listen to that charming finale				5106125.532596127
he had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals				16123.45370689714
i know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests				18604.26696727624
her skin was admired for its velvety softness her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable				593221.7278901127
before him on the front seat lay two pairs of pistols one in front of porthos and the other of d artagnan				1020.7877831591933
28 rue de la fontaine in a room hung with red damask my father took me in his arms telling my mother i was dead wrapped me in a napkin marked with an h and an n and carried me into a garden where he buried me alive a shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of m de villefort				88.54513319126434
are you french sir said he to athos				75.86024059522309
i can not resist doing so he must live zounds replied d artagnan why don t you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch				40823.414078057336
save me porthos and aramis arose				2529.5756657784955
the evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it				69.83892377990442
what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation				119879.51520462902
the inquiry m de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil				14425.88390688494
his insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor which he had climbed four steps at a time				127.84707799087928
the injured man had recovered his senses				1374.7884521244323
d artagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his wishes				2678.7524477986753
the peak of monte cristo reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky				28357.67858234519
jussac fell like a dead mass				5628.977338977032
then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf pardon me he added with a smile i leave you albert albert understood his thoughts				537.5550501849259
an hour afterward rochefort set out at a grand gallop five hours after that he passed through arras				9728724.323498162
some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two				1292.008553001416
he sighed and set to work again				179.89447243747512
but after his bath asked morcerf				313.3563859297473
thanks my dear friend said madame danglars trying to smile it is over now and i am much better chapter 64				170485.5450312505
thank him then madame if you have any affection for me milady frowned slightly a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at it				52.05181953089054
finally said felton finally what did they do at length one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he could not conquer				634216.4435993708
the queen full of energy and courage was quickly alive to these two virtues in others				555.6091178234559

when this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women alone				1171.6081198225727
well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it i am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the duke of buckingham to him whom you allowed to be assassinated to the duchess de chevreuse whom you suffered to be exiled to the duc de beaufort whom you imprisoned but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which i stand to you anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride				6355.060128619523
have you been satisfied with him this voyage that is according to the sense you attach to the question sir				128.50312415792104

be said the letter on thursday next at from six to seven o clock in the evening on the road to chaillot and look carefully into the carriages that pass but if you have any consideration for your own life or that of those who love you do not speak a single word do not make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an instant no signature				13053.149258344018
and yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame i proposed to chevalier de rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze horse				4795.637645633505
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme 20143m and you will probably find your theme ill chosen but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present				839879.0273986871
i hope we shall have something better to do to night than to draw the sword what have we to do egad				2921.0033391091224
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand				15.88363456691852
ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died of what did he die why the doctors called his complaint gastro enteritis i believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but i who saw him in his dying moments i say he died of caderousse paused				1619.542941990495
but there he is in the hands of justice and added he with a smile she will take her own so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon where m morrel had agreed to meet him				2.1220902933509525
you have come then at last				735.8849156618944
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over				366.57912153897877
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance				7363.721458322412

shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès				1710.0000458337176
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances and now i am convinced said d artagnan that this abduction of the queen s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration				704.9557484271393

in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal s hat				454.12627646529836
then gloom settled heavily upon him				1.9952800067246952

no you sounded me nothing more				303.3217608088958
poet as i am i am intimate with sarazin who is devoted to the prince de conti and with monsieur de bois robert who since the death of cardinal richelieu is of all parties or any party so that political discussions have not altogether been uninteresting to me i have no doubt of it said d artagnan				321.1340676508768

20177m the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen half an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men s minds so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld				6375.213399725442
the villefort family vault two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten o clock in the morning around the door of m de villefort s house and a long file of mourning coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint honoré and the rue de la pépinière				1586410.0873071651
he could not see it but he felt its presence				2251.38152167779
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit search then monsieur				250.64099726717956
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise d artagnan s vigilance				1358579.3953525722
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth				774.4004514715775
perhaps they are penitent and preparing to march if they are penitent said athos let them follow us well said the king what shall we do let us examine the enemy s army at the same instant the eyes of the little group were fixed on the same line which at daybreak they had mistaken for fog and which the morning sun now plainly showed was an army in order of battle				1072.4338047072788
mercédès extended her hand to the count				83.47269220272365
do you hear it				12.171473341600842
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us				129.90484430808655
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him				30.72714849893574
he wished to hasten their steps but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend				321.47679921560774
he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends returned				3069.3191609585324
it is he who in an encounter with your eminence s guards decided the victory in favor of the king s musketeers it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail it is he who knowing it was i who had madame bonacieux carried off has sworn my death ah ah said the cardinal i know of whom you speak i mean that miserable d artagnan he is a bold fellow said the cardinal				17.469620148113194
my shoulder quite burns if you would permit me said d artagnan with timidity				1025245.5034852219
pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified eye on the agonized sufferer				26919.580681049938
at the door stood two horses fresh strong and fully equipped				19717.60100317791
undoubtedly madame said d artagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own				1550.0288223099012

one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere				2655569.1821949873

the three presents of d artagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april 1625 the market town of meung in which the author of romance of the rose was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it				21478.582481312165

but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of château renaud this was followed by rather an awkward silence				725.1102687363166
d artagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him				44.601123803270156

one step farther into rest two perhaps into silence				376.7191531732056

when the two musketeers had entered when the door was closed behind them when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food had recommenced when m de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on parade he stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday evening do you know gentlemen no replied the two musketeers after a moment s silence no sir we do not but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow				3755.354464567539

he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet				1797.462250490684
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly				1005432.7196343732
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose				1631.3044628818823

ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know nothing we believe like mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said athos				635.53932703146

therefore he knew nothing either of the enemy s numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army				423.5868232999295

he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m de tréville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the queen				95.63895858275728
i would then rather die truly murmured valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not				127.0785904449649
planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow d artagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself				44.11403444354762

who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m de richelieu who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine my friends monsieur the queen shook her head				601.4649640773431
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of d artagnan and porthos in their hands				58.64826536731383
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her calm yourself				545.8307992607978
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips				68.62054083169119

i understand my game kitty i have this one safe what will you do with him madame what will i do with him				27.819925170534084
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the spaniard who had advanced to meet raoul aimed in his turn and raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip				14455.782586407624
another possessed all mercédès heart that other was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead				260.7662421378665
ah said d artagnan				1.0255050660232015
d artagnan owned nothing				717.5891686648663
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady s forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed or upon my soul i will blow your brains out with another man milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew athos				185.51406531478892
he remained there all night not knowing where he was				89.7358646232769
at length a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely master her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single tear				2173.38267579186
but when he saw the carriage take the way to la grêve when he perceived the pointed roof of the hôtel de ville and the carriage passed under the arcade he believed it was over with him				59.24417264814268
the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering				4224.59059790854

morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in law s gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance				227.6667980965492
an intervening elevation of land hid the light				2214.87646322075
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world				63.58921533755637
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city				444.8920756284365

oh i am sure of it we talked of you an hour after you left us the other day				179.86145002666282

the old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so and then when d artagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good				465.4161437508971
what do i say				38.67111560755676
m d avrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind				942.0889610102865
then he resumed in his turn discipline monseigneur has i hope in no way been forgotten by us				232.6784459687396
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads				1146.2100337505974

it was m de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers				10477.492989445622
for an active ambitious nature like that of milady days not spent in climbing are inauspicious days				710.6758856319115

my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said morcerf				372.58403449537207
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them				882.8880038727635
and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself i should my dear d artagnan have been so but nature said no when i am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me i look at her again if she smiles i smile too				334.0148188994291
this is the history of most men who have passed twenty years of age				403.71475637595023

they conducted me to the chatelet where i slept soundly being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free				6411.558759320354
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement				1844690.5780849576

they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy				12461.1287376655
it was necessary that d artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber				748.3303924607716
maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his father s neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on morrel s breast				574.3473146243794

but unfortunately i must wait 40138m you must wait for what asked caderousse				304.2251925952937
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground				3487.037843917026
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the case with those whose words are few and weighty				619785.4440968991

this is what was done				220.68663948052708
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers				872410.3347709985

at the sound of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges dantès who was crouched in a corner of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow iron grating above raised his head				36.129856714327275

the young men therefore had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of lucia di lammermoor supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy				4664.1568319001835
i wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office				3563.4346509036905

monsieur d artagnan said the valet de chambre				1333.2730418585252
i alone can save you and i will valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage and began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress				11251816.219935704
loose half drunk imposing the king s musketeers or rather m de tréville s spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged often killing others but then certain of not rotting in prison m de tréville being there to claim them				73.43940383098851

the interior of the musketeers when d artagnan was out of the louvre and consulted his friends upon the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles athos advised him to order a good repast at the pomme de pin porthos to engage a lackey and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress				1198.517295372317
this is the order he said				25.09008298068966
is the king dead				230.9723336235984
now we are alone dear aramis said d artagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchet s horse i faith answered aramis as you see from heaven from heaven replied d artagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which d artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same here then is a puzzle for the learned observed d artagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise some place it on mount ararat others between the rivers tigris and euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near				1006.5618294734235
he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse				2892.3615873060753
the morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence pardieu and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted				28793469.896371003

d artagnan signed to them to draw near				709.7939984099065
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to athos				112.04362257886312
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world				55.624583866092735
let me think a moment				73.42711331809316
the iron box was there no one had touched it under a beautiful fig tree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot				749.9682557548239
now m de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten months				1759.6863358490257
every man that s born must fulfil his destiny if it be not an indelicate question resumed d artagnan have you grown rich oh heaven				3508.128495782599
then athos took from his pocket a small paper on which two lines were written accompanied by a signature and a seal and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs of repugnance				17002.806367927078
he placed the young girl again on the chair her lips were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as her whole face and remained motionless looking at noirtier who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did				1014.1478186251568
they fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions				12378.46668146387
the poor girl under the caresses of d artagnan lifted her head				11.116826949213566
you are now almost a man since you have made your first passage of arms and have acquired the right to go where you will without consulting me never sir said raoul as long as i possess the happiness of having you for a protector shall i deem i have the right of freeing myself from a guardianship so valuable to me				264.37593174550125
the physician has a sacred mission on earth and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb				2110.3230705104374
the president again arose and having imposed silence said sir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimed if you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the general s anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said i will not swear then you must die replied the president calmly				4343.692633454079
you were right he said my dear monsieur d artagnan and you can not set out yet				1554.431296811113
at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment				254.52672053389384
the two friends were perfectly stupefied				474.82586250281753
yes i recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams yes i recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night crying to my soul which can not sleep strike save england save thyself for thou wilt die without having appeased god speak speak cried felton i can understand you now a flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of milady				44.73554498285696
and thou hast left him noble honored powerful for the ruin of us all god abandons him who abandons himself said milady				50.29862847855457
pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy then i have full occupation for i am so not yet wait a little				301.6693386666724
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man				3.5946250486730564
he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he re opened them and stood motionless with amazement				436.7035664282912
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the ante chamber where d artagnan was waiting				5634.057958154088
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with				1047.2023399081345
you were right my lord said felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of milady you were right my lord and i was wrong and both again left the room				20.526555861776522
caderousse terrified looked at the count				58.723765306059356
has such and such a perfume done anything for me				9.419759279540733
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid				434324.14056524576
you are in a shocking hurry to be off you forget one of my guests				4228.706091319508
at dawn twelve leagues had been passed without drawing rein half the escort were exhausted and several horses fell down				91.87549815170144
but there is no need to know danger in order to fear it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest terror				1414.761040005081
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime villefort tried to smile				557.4521419305025
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven				34474.16982740596
if richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great				2199.4569476678134
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire				2065002.0656013256
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at london why so because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering one of a most dangerous kind i give you notice ah				135.5170783022908
now say if i conceal anything from you no and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion and your princely father is he rich very rich yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his fortune is it possible it is evident enough to me who am always at his house				214.88917555767415
but his confidence in grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance				1261114.3998939148
that s true replied d artagnan i have not the uniform but i have the spirit				78350.19891812572
talk only by gestures or rather always listen yes monsieur replied raoul				50.87166202324011

you didn t know king charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side				97.49802067479135
and he answered that monsieur bazin went to noisy tis his custom				2075717.3758157399
i scarcely thought you were so curious as that i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies and he was not among the least of them				225.47667241526696
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness				390419.51201408205
they had reached the ladder which led to the boat				473.81418920906617
the host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which athos went himself to draw at the fountain				1143181.315606885
my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and i am sure he ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires				2665591.6127507645
m noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night				334.97149184364065
the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features				5624.115840246322
if she seduced your brother you said she seduced him did you not yes if she caused his death you said that she caused his death yes repeated the executioner				150.56900182625643
m de tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning only when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre and that he might repair at once to his post				20066.36421314477
sir said planchet in a mournful tone do you abandon me thus to my fate				4886.987599708341
danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror				142.87966238685175
it was now athos s turn to take a sly look				218.61160816347544
what is that again he asked				9.86750030182908
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba then said monte cristo you went to him monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out				219.51903773433023

yes my prince but listen				688.0103901760181
what are you doing asked rochefort				212.49180184143373
it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him nevertheless believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father however much i might be proud of such a son				447.32816055555054
you know there s only one way of saying things so i went in and said my lord we were not the strongest party yes i know that he said but give me the particulars you know porthos i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so i merely said they were fifty and we were two				1880.6350940448012
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table				282.0935114743006
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood				586.0714416162415
what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you eh parbleu they should kill me the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words				1846.1678693124697
the disappearance of mazarin was not as yet generally known				702.9521272217082

he now called himself du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds and resided on his new estate				17979.432035990132
in an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted				10088.481329067312
he attempted to ride over those gray cloaks but the gray cloaks held their ground and the marshal retired toward the rue saint honore leaving four of his guards dead on the field of battle				147.08458138354362
i am called said andrea				99.74393945086007

i was induced to marry her about three years ago although she had but very little dowry because monsieur laporte the queen s cloak bearer is her godfather and befriends her well monsieur asked d artagnan				384.9884042004263

besides she found herself in circumstances where everything must be risked for the sake of everything				383.9450850223836
what said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect and here you are running headlong after another d artagnan felt the truth of this reproach				4718054.638536531
my turn said athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent my turn				184.7640294588736
d artagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and listened				2999.3624069272732
how has this terrible past been recalled cried villefort how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame alas said hermine doubtless it is chance chance replied villefort no no madame there is no such thing as chance oh yes has not a fatal chance revealed all this				596.2819893777661
no i spoke of the duchess de chevreuse did you see her after her return from brussels after the king s death yes she is still beautiful yes said aramis i saw her also at that time				157.26314041436376
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment				263.02307951622765
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it				175.6734344265214
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his eminence i understand				653.3287574276967
yes a thousand times yes and who completed it as it now is i did				582.7758408840293

the curates asked him what was to be done				164.881414699788
his warm and fickle imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed				4708.2846794067855
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars				41.18709036034154
he went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him				3.629088220074219

our host has a well furnished cellar the key of which never leaves him only this cellar has a ventilating hole				19510.198872998324

milady was there as it were where you sit athos changed color				17749.657756020195
during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed madame de villefort had gone to visit m noirtier				80.93116943465598
d artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their companions and all four set forward athos upon a horse he owed to a woman aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress porthos on a horse he owed to his procurator s wife and d artagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortune the best mistress possible				2180.8863343846874
where is the count friend				733.9743083297072
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side				390.89430151122986
and me too said porthos				9.348181276257927
oh you know it tell them tell them and the young man s voice was choked by sobs				2433.4627043707537
at this moment the duke s surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admiral s ship where they had been obliged to seek him				5.032143506969947
an effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through				1515.395123987905
but continued d artagnan how did you escape i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window				57.678799459727294
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions				1487451.7201025586

for peppino cried andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged				975903.1430828923
m noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m noirtier try noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself				4707.781807204152
planchet whom he had sent home two hours before from the hôtel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him				3.3911185264898016
i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london and i say to you live sire it is the will of heaven the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked				212986.0465932225
then turning towards albert it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek both of which haydée speaks so fluently the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation the count made a sign to haydée to address his visitor				4284.5019367647565

she turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was bowing to her				49.29421071512255
but he had been unable to send to albert the following particulars as the events had transpired after the messenger s departure namely that the same day a great agitation was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly				1277.261292850847
did you see the president at the minister s last night yes what did he say something which will surprise you oh make haste and tell me then it is a long time since that has happened well he told me that benedetto who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning is really but a very commonplace silly rascal and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on his phrenological organs after his death bah said beauchamp he played the prince very well yes for you who detest those unhappy princes beauchamp and are always delighted to find fault with them but not for me who discover a gentleman by instinct and who scent out an aristocratic family like a very bloodhound of heraldry then you never believed in the principality yes in the principality but not in the prince not so bad said beauchamp still i assure you he passed very well with many people i saw him at the ministers houses ah yes said château renaud				5548.588166573047

if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france				390.5952553101256
the three musketeers possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about d artagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from d artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent				1755.6206442451512
i am a faithful subject of the king madame and all that his majesty commands i shall do well it is true said anne of austria and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully				3201276.431353936
in that case sir rejoined madame de villefort i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes she then bowed to m noirtier and retired				662.046041148494

the palace was surrounded with water but a kind of staircase had been fixed to the lower walls and the only difference was that instead of entering by the doors people entered by the windows				187.27502860699704
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once				709.5111054552904

descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it				3555.104836027269
immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun and the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice enemies				6868.215345385919
you are all mistaken gentlemen answered athos gravely you are eating horse eating what said d artagnan				1.0168383130022978

from him whom you have rendered the happiest of men comte de wardes this note was in the first place a forgery it was likewise an indelicacy				1197525.1299407831
but à propos resumed m de tréville what has become of your three companions i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them none monsieur well i left them on my road porthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining see there now said m de tréville and how the devil did you escape by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry there again				2152.7849995960323
between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover				948496.4481702981

yes tis too true said comminges tis almost a prison but what a singular fancy this is of yours count you who are the very flower of our nobility to squander your valor and loyalty amongst these upstarts the frondists				416807.6387695382
dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves				2620.7262694096326
he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone				1370.46208688237
he has taken part against his queen or rather against her minister				5466.291348987525
oh my king and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation				2378703.058573716

indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you i must try and persuade m danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may be compelled to ask us in return what said debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house why not				80.44553686291204
you are not willing that i should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul but i repeat it again to you replied felton in great emotion no danger threatens you i will answer for lord de winter as for myself dunce cried milady dunce				39992246.94802888

however to teresa s great astonishment luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening				132.11197072064584
i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen				959.4307697004615
i said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless next day next day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dantès was arrested yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak but danglars restrained me				60.111170998287776

most probably morrel and château renaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces but it was not the case with debray				567.5014287986872

one can easily see it comes from a priest gondy remained firm and the abuse of the day seemed to glide over his head as the sarcasms of the evening before had done but hatred and revenge were accumulating in his heart silently and drop by drop				4514148.815533973
as for the world it is a sepulcher and nothing else the devil				163.19112594830602
describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hands going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me let us see the watch said albert				1279.9670994327248

on descending we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view				4568.79083098947
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time sit down said the old man				1.229892604877604
farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full gallop				1645.556199355043
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside				479838.7399701999
that s all that is necessary said athos now for my idea i should like however to comprehend said porthos				7.02211694432014
he bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant journey				1152.2873893788847
what will it signify if one two or three more are added				4220.475084848668
oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again				93.08464629924035

ah said the king we shall soon see whether my highlanders have betrayed me or not what are you going to do exclaimed athos				8.009380159158745

the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods				472162.61821699096
dantès himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined				5137.515495100663
no divided as we now are we must perish				4529.131009183734
dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress got in by his side				418.19239460241926
besides the eyes of the gascons have as it is asserted like those of cats the faculty of seeing in the dark				38902.70428249836
dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it				875.5571110377435
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her				62.16023226737052
upon my word said caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of dantès united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantès good fortune upon my word dantès is a downright good fellow and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be				293.8011828573827

when you wish to obtain some concession from a man s self love you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to wound it i believe you are right i am glad of it then i will go alone go but you would do better still by not going at all that is impossible do so then it will be a wiser plan than the first which you proposed but if in spite of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight will you not be my second my dear viscount said monte cristo gravely you must have seen before today that at all times and in all places i have been at your disposal but the service which you have just demanded of me is one which it is out of my power to render you why perhaps you may know at some future period and in the mean time i request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my reasons well i will have franz and château renaud they will be the very men for it do so then but if i do fight you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing that too is impossible what a singular being you are you will not interfere in anything you are right that is the principle on which i wish to act we will say no more about it then				276.4868595898796

but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion				869683.16559599
in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs d œuvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grétry and porpora				1069414.3981134885

uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present				4127.318437522264

m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character				1806.7824023853632
the breakfast hour arrived but m de villefort was not at table				276.7236122755158

she then tried to seize the sword with her hands but d artagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty s apartment				168.40236150149576

he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier				15223.741357120512
the stranger placed the point of his sword at his throat and monsieur porthos finding himself at the mercy of his adversary acknowledged himself conquered				10563.899436366855

he was a man of twenty five or twenty six years of age of unprepossessing countenance obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his position as responsible agent on board which is always obnoxious to the sailors made him as much disliked by the crew as edmond dantès was beloved by them				1650.0710514822888
there said the king that consoles me they are not all traitors at this moment winter s voice was raised with the cry of forward the first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the plateau				2456660.6025955733

the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught				23855.318248124935
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand				23.877724051526826
and who brought you up he asked again				857.453378374177

tell me his name edmond dantès villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five and twenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch				1628859.2854757034
just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain				2204.2183239472897

athos was invited four times and each time took his friends and their lackeys with him				44.009697169306264

at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is 22 rue de rivoli and that i am at home to my friends every saturday evening				810.1955502412848
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table				46.62876772396176
thus d artagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means				10330.579456700345
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia				352190.9528685337
oh sir planchet only touched the tips of the count s fingers				707.8238767224253
the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all				258.8756542476189
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence				660480.2518191994
tis indeed they said she				79.10689335412312
planchet and bazin came last				1644.4901886689177
you make me young and happy again by it				33.42715715458042
ah it is m de morcerf said monte cristo quietly i thought i had not heard aright yes it is i said the count whom a frightful contraction of the lips prevented from articulating freely				239661.98772378248
monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling ali a horse for m de morcerf quick				9299.618819037443
believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you				14.868161101973214
you have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late now				645.6836864096625
in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in time to witness the raising of the siege				11125.877711394545
they had not seen him for two days				1540.6660653148606
no one can say that m noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed				144.25944893643356
she has always believed me sire to be her enemy although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you				11.4074599264939
how often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend a friend lost to him forever and on his death bed when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light this thought which had until then been but a doubt became a conviction and his last words were maximilian it was edmond dantès at these words the count s paleness which had for some time been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour said a few hurried words to madame herbault and pressing the hands of emmanuel and maximilian madame said he i trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first time for many years that i have thus yielded to my feelings and he hastily quitted the apartment				325.12050556632255
then i speak at random instead of preaching about the torments of hell i talk of the joys of paradise				3072.6461834866345
it was situated in the via dei banchi near st peter s				147.00513944380992
well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to france with us friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable then you have some other motive unknown to us athos smiled and d artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head				9.055685061373737
m de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court				1619.431740619752
all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel long live the coadjutor long live the queen cried de gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness				4615.184323295078
at length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him				18.18858623945551
but tell me all about it why do you wish to know asked cavalcanti				367.58383954841446
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter				141.73680655027042
well at twenty nine i saw valentine for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife				14211.430867119663
it may be worn at via reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in paris that s unfortunate oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave paris but what shall i wear what you find in your trunks in my trunks				9285905.352396924
the arrest produced no sensation indeed was almost unknown and scarcely interrupted the course of events				36708.62364093523
yes and that s all settled exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail				563281.7279060503
there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce you with your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received				733.6100630820405
this cursed rolling said blaisois				6355.78744915121
whatever command she had over herself milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him				2.2755361075407348
then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him				2.7670347261632147
yes but why don t you come there also athos colored a little and answered should i go i shall be delighted to see you there halloo planchet cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay then turning to athos he added i seem to miss something here				236.99465906385316
he has come thought milady				42.17455164400888
d artagnan rushed out of the room				41.32422535395027
you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali				3087.3474113460534
the joy she felt at this discovery was so great she could not conceal it				10.71624532957526
ah my friend said the abbé turning towards dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass probably if ever i get out of prison true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty but wherefore are you here because in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in 1811 because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my cæsar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me				1380.450924369518
or at least i will go later he drew kitty to him				5.0044939747557855
you do not madame at least i hope not				132.74533294044812
this might be a kind remembrance of monsieur the cardinal				45.951375810637494
why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment				5241.892447464573
the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes				1086535.998729312
how fortunate that eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and her glance was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all things and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing				1172259.2593077035
he was never seen at the theatres at concerts or in any place of public resort				521349.0372507439
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twenty five thousand				46860.32658988223
at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine				427.6033732039654
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm				4178.750682301656
god doubtless neither heard nor saw me and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death				121.65010002303636
have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave				36178.8555172747
take care i repeat to you take care				1657.8046277349968
is treated at the court of france monsieur aramis is not an officer asked the queen of lord de winter				3.165618322777596
from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues before our letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will take that upon myself				815.4772286825478
go on my child said the count in the romaic language				446.9759232665802
at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams				5336.834277303943
you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m d artagnan a difficult commission my lord replied d artagnan resuming his serious manner				217.9043252180387
is he prosperous and happy he died a more wretched hopeless heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head				14266.807926781747
your majesty is bored				1306194.16609458
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel				11322.919627717434
what are we to do maltese asked the captain				50.96715628283702
yes but listen this was not all				173.45655789175953
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat				549.0933958895218
i never saw a man with a nobler air than his without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can said porthos				679.7860434600403
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared				37.161719943849604
planchet two hours before had asked his master for some dinner and he had answered him with the proverb he who sleeps dines and planchet dined by sleeping				6212.091599217678
eh eh said he reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period there is one who will be equipped in good time porthos yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator s wife as a bark yields to the rudder arrived at the cloister st magloire a little frequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each end				1410.2537408508203
it is you mordaunt he said				3.497973896580781
three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him				2.0704532136470393
i speak to you in french said d artagnan be kind enough then to reply to me in the same language				851.4295590275184
the cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the manner of that splendid picture by léopold robert				815556.2472548089
didn t i say so cried planchet				180.6147500483996
how came it known i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from yanina who wrote to yanina to yanina yes				1329.3593729837607
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue				2309.49103440972
for the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague				87743.37420652984
our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his majesty was announced				254.1793604023045
as to that you must leave it to me i give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like d artagnan shook his head				4.656474756162076
de salvieux my brother s chamberlain yes sire he is at marseilles and writes me thence does he speak to you of this conspiracy no but strongly recommends m de villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty m				1169.5819153067182
seven o clock in the morning				112.40954966283218
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best				13259.503075665925
a few shots were fired and one musketeer was wounded				3776.7638982387225
the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet				427143.0584410534
when the patron awoke the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze				42102.46128182964
upon the side next the ground were scratched the following words eight of the light dragoons are pursuing us				111.03204352158984
at the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard				210.27422532402113
he will see us if we go out then you must come up into my room ah said mme				46.68982978677736
ah my dear fellow said albert rising and lighting his third cigar really i thought you had more courage so saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage				77.29833859890562
the interrogatories preceded by a minute search operated upon the persons arrested were almost always framed thus has madame bonacieux sent anything to you for her husband or any other person				1808.9116622833933
overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night threw himself on his bed and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight				13376.73391060642
that poor little diamond was worth seven thousand livres it appears so said athos since here they are				252.9457380484011
i was most anxious to see you but it must have vexed m morrel good worthy man said caderousse				22.627595220897838
yes monsieur i am on the point of marrying a young girl i have been attached to for three years villefort impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous voice of dantès surprised in the midst of his happiness struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom he also was on the point of being married and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another				168.6624949404839
i am saved murmured he				23.649664131111155
the agent arose and having bowed to lord wilmore who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired				839.1427768378483
dantès was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom				2023.5003030369278
athos surmised what had taken place and smiled				1273.8229939718733
is it because my opinions differ from yours nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement				35827.19758659349
however as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt				773947.5726418438
madame de morcerf did not lose sight of monte cristo she saw that he took nothing and even noticed his gesture of refusal				14810.267676556477
do you know m andrea i think you have managed this affair rather skilfully not badly by any means said the young man i was born for a diplomatist well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is something that is not to be acquired it is instinctive				2292800.7260242146
is the baroness at home inquired danglars				68.11010607929218
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven				278.2979076327267
i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles that was no reason for staking my diamond replied d artagnan closing his hand with a nervous spasm				2902595.5543020437
grimaud came rubbing his half open eyes to answer this noisy summons and d artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lackey				63560.57388243131
in ensnaring me you have fallen into the trap yourselves				1377274.709229201
for a time the delightful remembrance of madame bonancieux left on his character a certain poetic tinge perishable indeed for like all other recollections in this world these impressions were by degrees effaced				3878.0334368192794
she drew her husband to the door				43.60374959379484
why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you				5.100714274581276
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to franz				134.34794828233015
d artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal s letter it was however merely a letter of introduction				1415181.5206158436
how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same night as he had stated but the next morning the count of monte cristo went out by the barrière d enfer taking the road to orléans				28991.95329028943
if anyone wishes to stop us i will show monsieur de tréville s letter and you will show your leaves of absence				20390.451338209783
i did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange the letter signed sinbad the sailor is it not exactly so				51.771833508720746
go and tell lord de winter that his prisoner has fainted for this event not having been foreseen i don t know what to do the soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer				3919.636190270453
in about ten minutes d artagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos				395.1451999179582
take this ring raise money with it and let your husband set out in an hour you shall be obeyed you see the address said the queen speaking so low that mme				804.4488732765527
it was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking a death without agony a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing valentine s name and pressing your hand yes you have guessed rightly morrel said the count that is what i intended thanks the idea that tomorrow i shall no longer suffer is sweet to my heart do you then regret nothing no replied morrel				22.327092850692868
they had seen no one				887.5412591574272
yes but he couldn t understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in 1643 immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her and what said the abbé asked athos				1072.9550237636945
olivain take care of our horses and give me my sword the two gentlemen then went into the church				24330.949741245244
i shall follow the count s directions not under present circumstances monsieur perhaps you mean to disobey me yes monsieur i must you persist then yes i am going may you be happy monsieur and grimaud saluted and turned toward the door to go out				26.530943457573482
several persons are invited and among others m danglars your banker				7742.11067521464
poor fellow he exclaimed				564.2841505292744
athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers				994.7368383225972
good said he our syndic is at his post he knocked and the door was opened				790.3337391097265
the frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled beppo but he could not resist five armed men and was forced to yield				15376.452735505187
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he re entered the hôtel and flew toward kitty s chamber				69.8115550693521
i can imagine the effect i do not see the means i will find the means myself you are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable oh				1114.5454949695663
after so many years of painful separation said andrea in the same tone of voice and glancing towards the door what a happiness it is to meet again indeed it is after so long a separation will you not embrace me sir said andrea				100.54393030468566
the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts				4209.90270765765
you do not understand the points of english horses the countenance of poor ali recovered its serenity				19879.79225390863
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès				407.83019798693357
my lord said d artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time				2320.789889043621
there is the prince de condé the hero of rocroy				16797.10693950039
do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars oh no not at all				29.99555299323009
sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome				1364.9876780954178
i am not in love with mademoiselle mercédès but for you in the words of the gospel seek and you shall find i have found already what i would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself pooh				6088.744359949186
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all				679.8045201041077
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of d artagnan				1.0604338656000982
it is now three years madame since i saw you for the first time and during those three years i have loved you thus				401.9134637518521
i have a despatch from the prince to his eminence you must still deliver it said athos				5.713744695820654
she opened the door				13.088761728961265
40164m then i shall believe god has forgiven you and i will forgive you too as true as i am a christian stammered caderousse you will make me die of fright now begone said the count pointing to the window				8995.140224399516
however his remark did not make madame de villefort even smile so much was every mind engaged and so solemn was the situation				1691.2597925163318
at this moment grimaud appeared at the door				14.436607112417393
she knew him she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone				970364.5392177505
i love to see you thus				268.840460035199
i say your troops for i presume that you gentlemen are frondeurs yes almost said aramis				7.226376857723634
but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake what happened during the night asked beauchamp of château renaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron				175669.17918107947
he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood				20326.419675314908
morrel called her and she ran to the gate				864.3132267531039
the sum was collected in a minute				3502.0347437004034
the bird on the branch the dog in his kennel the sheep in the field the boats moored in the loire even became alive and vocal				6117529.705151786
three days passed seventy two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes				5775.162306488149
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that i do so				11.90420284051259
the prisoner himself is named edmond dantès mate on board the three master the pharaon trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna and belonging to morrel son of marseilles before he entered the merchant service had he ever served in the marines oh no monsieur he is very young how old nineteen or twenty at the most at this moment and as villefort had arrived at the corner of the rue des conseils a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached it was m morrel				636.8829483242708

at the same minute one of the little windows of the hôtel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared				106.3590384831677
i will allow you to make me hateful but i will prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me the baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of villefort had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising as if touched by a spring she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three steps towards her husband as though to tear the secret from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation odious as all his calculations were				3983.655480392543

grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes				2612.4989547709265
her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her				19.57815391820215
luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind				100.668323602814
madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass				273.6630126342264

and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves				1051.260870796798
you sir know how necessary subordination is in any large establishment of servants d artagnan smiled porthos wanted to lengthen out his names mousqueton to cut his short				2356.946993313876
at length m de tréville himself returned				1831.7554570569555
and now now escort me where where i am going but where are you going you will see because you will leave me at the door shall i wait for you that will be useless you will return alone then perhaps yes perhaps no but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman i don t know yet but i will know it how so i will wait until you come out in that case adieu why so i do not want you but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy the word is rather hard how are they called who follow others in spite of them they are indiscreet the word is too mild well madame i perceive i must do as you wish why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once is there no merit in repentance and do you really repent i know nothing about it myself				556.362839010362
la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus grimaud however did not even smile				783.4018199123864
adieu sir one word one single word more doctor				3904.481577429691
the host his mind at ease about his bill placed pen ink and paper upon the table				63.97830641082619
i do not understand italian yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant s shoulder				1174.227837195198
and with my grandfather s consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but morrel s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them				19.1610152653048
the queen breathed more freely				4631.895746840804
i believed i had a right to endeavor to find her				99.58943642123094
ah exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says himself alas yes murmured de winter				3.3478583942026945
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power				1353.4265749680433
well my dear parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner oh my king said parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall and why parry do not look i implore you my king but what is the matter				93.44344403462591
as usual valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them				565.5226992406346
you unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today let us say no more about it well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied aramis patiently				5199996.698169157
this is something new replied the king				15.982599312441117
it was like having a spy in the enemy s camp				1008.3320593064918
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions				21600.02338938724
as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table				164.38590132502972
i did not lose sight of him for an instant				225.47893025534148
these were all who were left of the little troop				16186.157771085453
these proceedings made d artagnan and porthos draw back				201.83514456228895
presently the door opened and she perceived felton				282.28485335224616
the obscurity was broken only now and then by the still darker lines of the roofs of houses				2167.2664716531467
twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare				1041052.1626227461
then he had a moment s hesitation				13305.408734661012
by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide				3826.534534813561
it seems like a woman				471.36128832825324
he had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board and as his orders were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure				1637.7571486989123
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses				1256.365991051589
a laborer would not have done in a day what occupied me an hour				3914.219754404242
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her d artagnan then related the poisoning of mme				214.43633871733093
bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable				27092.653960678326
then when he thought i had said all he advanced toward me i sprang toward the table i seized a knife i placed it to my breast				540.6506095148753
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep				813.7122078582751
have they offered you money				756.6332012790958
come you are no longer twenty years old to my great regret mordieu				19905243.73301642
he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette				2243127.408671273
the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day				1230.8624843116518
as one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree to the wing of a pigeon to the collar of a dog and yet me you see plainly that i love you you say so i am an honorable man you say so i am a gallant fellow i believe it i am brave oh i am sure of that then put me to the proof mme				240.58769966573263
one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita at this moment carlini heard a woman s cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came				425.8264414885502
in england the post was well served				1200.6314128350427

another gasconade murmured the gentleman				10844.199965379452
shall we go forward				1144.3619812448972
then valentine s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds				4184.357585598567
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan				2785.57869923137
why does he go in secret				631.4486622316477
you wish me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she				57.24063791089054
i am of d artagnan s opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our camp my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat				1177.8414815004778
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo				392.78478193072743
during the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man m de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans				12486.740970164823
you will i trust excuse me monsieur for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you he said but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that i am myself a representative of the liberties of the people so much so replied monte cristo that while you call yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count upon my word monsieur said danglars with affected carelessness i attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions but the fact is i was made baron and also chevalier of the legion of honor in return for services rendered but but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs de montmorency and lafayette				15626695.691785157
sir tis this very coating of fat that makes me shiver how is that mousqueton				2527.943003949278
a galley slave escaped from confinement at toulon and what crime has he committed he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the count of monte cristo monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him				2.8536639728774515
lord de winter thought athos was mad				3073.6455795593693
in his eyes and to his conviction mme				166.4639082534868

what does your worship want demanded the host pale and trembling from the discovery he had just made				1690.750189423087
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall				2441.321758931913
i know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much				323.37677532940995
at the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number 1 d artagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the chamber				273.09934352715055
to hold for five minutes the gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder				63986.85514458428
he opened his eyes				11.431377973158947
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom				723717.9201683775
come come cried rochefort				884.0448100589201
danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart				920.0272470656392
how can i understand				291.3169278521757
but where is my old friend winter the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence				344.68217376106924
come father added dantès put this money back in your box unless neighbor caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his service no my boy no said caderousse				20.289194298441277
do you come from the end of the world said monte cristo you a journalist the husband of renown				23750.01316188965
tomorrow you shall be free i had but one wish that was that he should kill me				3.996528717311469
alas i have only my tongue but i will try to show that it is good for something				20078.04104272864
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening				817.1728189522532
adieu adieu murmured the old man clasping edmond s hand convulsively adieu oh no no not yet he cried do not forsake me				5.806387345737661
the first opportunity you have undeceive him i beg and tell him i am nothing of the kind franz smiled an instant after the count entered				12.677699599331271
is he afraid of me or of his father				118.59760968569019
oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render but can not they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions well sir go said louis xviii and remember that i am waiting for you i will but go and return sire i shall be back in ten minutes and i sire said m de blacas will go and find my messenger wait sir wait said louis xviii				3882.1889433824617
grimaud and blaisois are holding your horses ready saddled in that case exclaimed athos let us not lose an instant but set off come added the king				11.097326099843574
