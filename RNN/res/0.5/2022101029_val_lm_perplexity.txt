anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival				15853.452487250413
take this said madame de villefort giving her smelling bottle to valentine				337.19167297976685

they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said				65.07202093386431

but do you know where no in the king s room the king s room cried athos				5.618441491677468
his warm and fickle imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed				752475.7995264156

tis true thought the gascon where has he heard it				13.719229946016933
i am no longer astonished that you knew me not				33.5024275016331
albert glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate hand and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some attention				2052.959162454683

it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance see that now said porthos and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him				8.311812440187955
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule				557.126349333835
vampa then removed the stone and cucumetto came out				180.96854829068442
men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the café de paris it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters				311529.72266336746

the son has been educated in a college in the south i believe near marseilles				7129.55792207562
what has happened then sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen				125.37285687344892
as to fortune he had made he humble as he was an enemy of the cardinal that is to say of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom beginning with the king				60.94454612110012

the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated				275371.67205725703
he lost it the day before yesterday and olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn olivain according to the custom of serving men well pleased with their place relating to the tavern keeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman whilst raoul wrote on thus sir after a four hours march i stop to write to you for i miss you every moment and i am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me				210.97263630989607
blood and anger mounted to his face he was resolved to unravel the mystery				12492.934813596941
it was about one of those purchases that interest women a purchase by which much might have been gained but the more the young woman excused herself the more important bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him				2.8359764180245812
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more				380.0623331002825
oh he said i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans				2621.4436722320597
milady had told the truth her head was confused for her ill arranged plans clashed one another like chaos				2000951.4270396146
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room				1410.0224331054433
the count had just opened a door				20.46178944702666
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by god s				250.53596564716528
do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat aramis rushed after the fugitive hat				6370.071897928282
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned				659175.7941107389
and yet he but desired the good of the people yes my lord like yourself said the queen ironically				173435.73272694158
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner you have seen him asked aramis in the same language				2155.470016503252
we performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirty six pound shot at his head and his heels off el giglio island				11138.670669580955

and yet at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts				1923.840933264257
well while i was watching not the king as monsieur le comte thinks for i know what it is to see a man led to death and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill while i was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as i said to find out who he was				34.90434608157294
why you see he did not expect to see dantès return so suddenly he thought he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless				284802.2290868878
police affairs cried the king taking up tréville s words police affairs				103781.01547003724
in the first place said athos let us leave this chamber the dead are not agreeable company particularly when they have died a violent death planchet said d artagnan i commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care				1586.5052518519194

these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them this is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy				2003.352306214906
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen				1537.0257897952483
if you do not come across one return for me the patron shook his head				9.424438537797498
i knew very well that they tired out their executioners but i did not believe them so strong against their lovers alas				191.20104428448207

go monsieur duke and return often				152112.24793523323

fifty cavaliers cried the gascon and porthos				253.0545552103148
you can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than speak very well said d artagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me planchet				519.117631837033
england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained				15874.75438075066

what again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me a long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground				126.62577899092565
in about half an hour the girls went away and maximilian understood that mademoiselle danglars visit had at last come to an end				292.16691004892954
yes skirmishers that is to say highway robbers at them cried raoul				155.6950437393084
felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning him and he made several steps toward the door but the prisoner whose eye never left him sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him				2.2335144918930174
a paltry piece of business murmured d artagnan crumpling his note				166989.18965342978
on whom do my hopes rest				950.1232390602552

my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for heretics in truth said athos aramis is right				12357.848686559359
monsieur continued she turning to monte cristo will you do us the honor of passing the rest of the day with us believe me madame i feel most grateful for your kindness but i got out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris which i scarcely know this is but a trifling inquietude i know but one that may be appreciated we shall have the pleasure another time said the countess you promise that monte cristo inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent				9440.518917681902
his calm noble gaze forced the man to turn away his head				27.548445302139857
oh d artagnan my beloved d artagnan				1.1237311390408602
three of them were overwhelmed and disabled by numerous assailants one of them alone arrived at the port having either killed or wounded those who wished to stop him				2.078141742858365
i don t suppose that our friend d artagnan has added any of his own to the amount but gentlemen in all this said d artagnan we do not think of the queen				78.64173171110625
suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleon well can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellow creatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey				4268.335532350104
yet you have need i believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if i mistake not you came to paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said d artagnan				1.0071661470240971
he came down into the kitchen where your doublet was				737.5243767810554
i do not jest said athos				7.450923426293235
indeed i expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack				14420.698225853286
what do i see that he wouldn t swear swear what that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight and aramis wouldn t swear no attention then athos did not lose sight of the two speakers				2787932.3218267155
neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it				14.90370515157786
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the darkness				500.841418111899
at another time added he i should have said give them besides two hundred francs over as a present but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this account penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them				19.23118984317907

never have i seen you look so young so beautiful the duchess shook her head				6.390407759852275
the count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wall flowers				663.8612063484686
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task				3737.340465083234
the baron took the pen and signed then the representative				2635222.5288309334
the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface dantès touched it and found that it was a beam				798236.6368449014
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention				2876.7885246672754
monsieur de tréville awaits monsieur d artagnan cried a servant throwing open the door of the cabinet				80565.92972335174
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abbé d herblay and in spite of bazin s assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion				2860.546275316667
i will see the queen i will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman of which she is no doubt ignorant				1529.591587503558
once sir when i was grafting a rose tree well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another ah that is another case i should be turned off and lose my pension three hundred francs a hundred crowns yes sir so you see that i am not likely to do any of these things not even for fifteen years wages				1179575.5247169128
i remember now yes it was about stop a minute yes it was about a woman that s it replied athos becoming almost livid that is my grand story of the fair lady and when i relate that i must be very drunk yes that was it said d artagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue eyes yes who was hanged by her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued d artagnan looking intently at athos				44.57320835071986
in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study				3124.5951844938627
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear				4124.977111895816
the servant conducted him by the rue des petits champs and turning to the left entered the little garden gate leading into the rue richelieu then they gained the private staircase and d artagnan was ushered into the oratory				150147.2269815266
i think so indeed we should be hard to please if we were not				132.9049395417112
hope faintly murmured fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance				310.7758292515242
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory				6537.105158102018
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his father s or in his cabin on board the pharaon very good resumed danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the king s attorney and that s all settled and danglars wrote the address as he spoke				3761.835194403151
30321m doubt if you please but i am sure of what i say				172.00915839230382

the deputy procureur du roi in one of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain a second marriage feast was being celebrated almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by dantès				905.8503630892139
in fact he could say these two children of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which i alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the english people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say a throne				4302.9408460204195
the breakfast and what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast said beauchamp				53.507976801557284
my lord who told you that nobody but i know it i regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the gascon impudently firm to the promise he had just made to anne of austria				68.7022606288219
there are moments when a man grows young again in his children the duchess smiled half tenderly half ironically				903316.3351675428
thence introduced into a half subterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment				215518.4442587833
it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on foot wait said caderousse we shall see he then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off cavalcanti s hat which he placed upon his own head and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a servant whose master drives himself				128.42447105553535
yes it is i my uncle i the son of milady i the monk i the secretary and friend of cromwell i know you now both you and your companions in that boat sat three men unquestionably brave whose courage no man would have dared dispute nevertheless at that voice that accent and those gestures they felt a chill access of terror cramp their veins				13822.854134365287
then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon				7360.962096783803
before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived				669.4646141780065
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity				48153.969379832706
and pray what would come to pass supposing the king were five years older than he is as soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands himself and tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of henry iv				2898.566292528491
the poor girl originally possessed much more than that she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the thousand and one nights would seem but poverty she must be a princess then you are right and she is one of the greatest in her country too i thought so				57.808789244928036
there was no great cunning necessary				46784.72832922342
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance				486.94740920036344
has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command				19612.4287119427
this evening or tomorrow the cardinal will send someone to take you away who told you that my dear asked milady				54.486004916712346
in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into life valentine the daughter by my first wife mademoiselle renée de saint méran and edward the boy whose life you have this day saved and what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired monte cristo				250.55376654334853

good said the sentry you may now go on luigi and teresa again set forward as they went on teresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the trees				577.8340895262622
all three then cried all s over hush said d artagnan				1.004324436222166
he aimed a terrible blow at d artagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bastion				12514.231690780478
one of them hat in hand said to him would you believe it monsieur				198.02192598088655

the baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price				11301.645238085426
all had plainly seen a woman s head appear at the window but none of them except athos knew mme				24.06061054222293
very little except long live cromwell where were you placed mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general s face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything				213.79709855750372
when i look at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this man it seems to me we are not of the same race i am highly flattered returned beauchamp				1413.140205213642

we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis				279.0957967497982
noirtier s hair was long and white and flowed over his shoulders while in his eyes shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body and so although the movement of the arm the sound of the voice and the agility of the body were wanting the speaking eye sufficed for all				325.6921363198757
who art thou cried he clasping his hands				21.482016814770393
we shall see better what is going on and then monsieur de chatillon will not come to the place royale to look for you				14.691102392353535
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then reappear				32741.058892434216
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthos s horse and that of d artagnan				1.008213043269929
edmond said mercédès i have but one word more to say to you the count smiled bitterly				1298.524548643352
behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first peppino and then andrea				3791.2853983469145
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand				24.181459763553626
but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of henry iv				2970.6293221352744
ah but the valise i want cried porthos is a well filled one my dear madame uttered fresh sighs				10564.745729908294
dead dead the cold sweat sprang to the young man s brow and his teeth chattered				309052.9116979543
i will swear to you by my soul s salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth				26452.411568084204
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank				2874.413617759122
he can not possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere slave a dog who should he fail in his duty towards me i should not discharge from my service but kill baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment				52.36643231636208
it is but you will not look will you it is because they have had the axe with which criminals are executed brought and placed there on the table				69.39264644289086
come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are a fallen prince exclaimed mazarin piteously				52459.95947656295
let me see it said milady				53.43311837351982
the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first				253.42551222462333
during this time nothing new occurred in the camp at la rochelle only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of st louis at st germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty musketeers				779.6156788203191
i depend upon you to escort me home				1266.433548035928
ali was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey				840651.5185353227
it is only the dead who do not return you think so porthos replied the musketeer with a sad smile which d artagnan alone understood				90056.25175414502
there can be no longer any doubt but that it is himself said he				6.279937476456046
without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance				1319.8056790070846
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds				2089686.4037919266
well said athos don t you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question				246.4408585118445
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed				592643.8229518827
this man is still your friend and you perhaps make use of him as your accomplice 40160m oh reverend sir since you left toulon what have you lived on				394.58843484535026
in the position of porthos d artagnan would have been perfectly happy and to make porthos contented there was wanting what				222.85829082101063
bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent				2435.090080629211
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villefort s we say slowly for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts				366.3203362787977
he has put out the lamp i can see nothing now get down then and quickly grimaud leaped down				275.65278696673806
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken shall i send word to him as coming from you yes certainly shall i tell him that he can count on you to the end and you will leave the command to him of the war yes but in politics you must know it is not his element he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinal s hat in my own fashion you care about it then so much since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing				9858.870998699615
the count s serious face was illumined by a faint smile as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his hand				15.764318772193468
he rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window he saw glittering below him the muskets of the guards				120.93506560559837
oh mercy mercy monsieur what i require is that justice be done				175.8989139071099
monsieur if she has escaped it is not my fault i swear what business had you then to go into the chamber of monsieur d artagnan your neighbor with whom you had a long conference during the day ah yes monsieur commissary yes that is true and i confess that i was in the wrong				8806.19689391455
meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours				721.9500182738368
the count of monte cristo had just entered				361.16560255935605
the men are all infamous and i am happy to be able now to do more than detest them i despise them what shall we do asked louise				1473.462131169663
20043m there s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it rose				12200.824891198201
monsieur said d artagnan you must excuse famished travelers				741115.010654855
he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground				103.19004250033836
at the moment she entered the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed was drawn and the pale face of the cardinal appeared he being dressed as a spanish cavalier				4237.90685660153
i neither reproach you nor hate you my friend				61.80671363341454
i hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim oh no monsieur d artagnan said raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you eh				2231.0827202999917
at pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine o clock galloped into the yard of tréville s hôtel				1300.093891186924
the island was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his treasure was just as he had left it				6.287190615940399
the captain of the musketeers was therefore admired feared and loved and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune				4103.522618103748
must we then asked anne of austria yield to the storm buy peace and patiently and piously await better times mazarin smiled sarcastically at this speech which showed that she had taken the minister s proposal seriously				7515.484447341754
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said d artagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m bonacieux				230.73434187478395
yes this self of whom i thought so much of whom i was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the château d if and whom i had succeeded in making so great will be but a lump of clay tomorrow				2352.4692191240392

yes my lord apropos what are the names of your friends the count de la fere formerly styled athos monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos the chevalier d herblay now the abbé d herblay whom we styled aramis the cardinal smiled				22.92363084197773

andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances				60390.02698518355

felton and he addressed patrick the duke s confidential lackey at the same moment				116.07230700115385
speak out there s a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise				2540.8836199771645
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you can all three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools				1540204.9239236657

at least you don t speak well of him that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim but this letter in which he recommends you to me is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites but why have you not fled whither should i go				473.4442567350309
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee				9440938.480488816

great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality				4684.377056084508

without communicating his thoughts to his companion he sat down drew out his opera glass and looked another way				464.01080422092855

we will do the same the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with d artagnan				1.0221098660273507
what cried d artagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos yes that disturbs you by no means and here is the second d artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis				26.327396633115008

oh i would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists say our masters in everything those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities but said franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law				1332.0523173576194
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served				15023.00813464976

everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow				292071.24362236704
then i saw that they took me for the assassin				18161.587330388887

d artagnan rushed out of the room				22.409797741532
zounds exclaimed porthos tis astonishing how empty violent agitation makes the stomach and he drank off half a bottle at a draught and bit great mouthfuls of the bread and meat				25493.194201181348
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure together till tomorrow then said aramis for iron nerved as you are you must need repose the next morning when d artagnan entered aramis s chamber he found him at the window				1970.0411456715285
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir				32948.79474421925
that health which excellent my dear friend better than ever				382.4664619793937

a man bringing a letter from oliver cromwell said mazarin				40.747145103675265

my friends retire they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered				4184.7127564493185
my friends said athos this is what i expected from such hearts as yours				403.41359656165747
during the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man m de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans				6480.42099905299

when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos porthos drew his dripping hand from the font				1952533.2970773845
you will say then to my good and faithful parisians continued anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive d artagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but but what asked anne of austria				25.538927516637138
d artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising milady to renounce by pardoning de wardes the furious projects she had formed				1474.7723625535848
who goes there cried a hoarse voice				105.95974254032298
besides the king i am certain awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king				352.4535035753229
i will not sign this order				2006.6047817201552
we bet upon one hour and we have stayed an hour and a half				11287.287173982228
i respected your father very much said he				7.464226601613436
he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from hunger				3199.7850934081875
the face of the shortest of those three gentlemen no he looked to me but tis impossible at this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said the passports are in order let these three gentlemen pass the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission				33762.69000138416
i am of d artagnan s opinion we have no time to lose in regaining our camp my faith said athos i have nothing to say against a retreat				1168.9719504898706
the only question was had she ten or twelve				21642.314079748616
i expected thee said the bandit to rita s father				176.67933686507658

ah my head oh what agony shall i suffer like this long no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer ah i understand you said the unhappy man				2.501907848632036
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette				132535.04686887877
villefort understood the king s intent				1169862.5843303567
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber				96.86465227553225
an envoy of the duke of buckingham named montague was taken and proof was obtained of a league between the german empire spain england and lorraine				375712.43258941127
i am taken shouted athos with all the power of his lungs				68593.95053771959

will you permit a grandson of henry iv				18.162733090213642
not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other				11948.260118870789
if you had been a man you would not have let him go from here woman or else he should not have reached beaucaire woman the road takes a turn he is obliged to follow it while alongside of the canal there is a shorter road woman you offend the good god				854.6816701660969
but a woman who wanders in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover				46847.81520322729
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwell s desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords crossed				81514.13837434855
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you the king is really very handsome said porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed				69785.06895188222
athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right				4564.353063533369
the lackeys were ordered to act as sentinels				5830.602095024625
have the fugitives been pursued yes my officer unfortunately they are well mounted how many are there four and a fifth whom they carried away wounded four said d artagnan looking at porthos				79.26529176660131
had you then that sum the queen s famous diamond answered d artagnan with a sigh				78.41608527394642
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose				775203.3499968665
but touching these spanish affairs i think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the don carlos matter				24179.945854243906
come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody				80899.23016335518
oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him				1.6613215838763244
a similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men				1737.2955738191583
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary				50666.885977825244
the other leaned against a tree supported there by the two valets and was praying fervently with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven				212.35151444889476
now he said are you in pain yes my head is not only swimming but burning what s the matter with this head said d artagnan raising the battered hat				1172.8221715788954
it closed after him with a spring				70351.65296232807
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door				8.173685934692603
what is proposed to me would be in fact almost an abdication and an abdication requires reflection an abdication repeated anne i thought sir that it was kings alone who abdicated well replied mazarin and am i not almost a king king indeed of france				2701.5212523661025
notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain villefort rose as he perceived her				21.53922041723813
where my god where we have orders to lead you but that is not an answer it is nevertheless the only one we can give ah my god my god murmured the poor mercer now indeed i am lost and he followed the guards who came for him mechanically and without resistance				1541.4280824614766
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name				471.401297764914
do you know monsieur de tréville their captain oh yes him				259.0295080963856
he led the way toward the hill of saint roche				2546721.932664984
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her				8.86015141515459
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other that s exactly the reason i won t go said d artagnan				1.006284117887315
now this is not all he said you can not live upon your fifteen thousand francs i shall still have my place no you will lose it for you are going to alter your correspondent s message oh sir what are you proposing a jest sir unless you force me i think i can effectually force you and monte cristo drew another packet from his pocket				100.31808476181008
and i too he exclaimed in a low voice i unite with m morrel in demanding justice for crime my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession oh merciful heavens murmured villefort				91.57174336235914
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five and forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year 1829 your excellency in what month june the beginning or the end the evening of the 3rd 20303m ah said monte cristo the evening of the 3rd of june 1829				19065.571680431185

i tell you i am madame bonacieux i tell you i belong to the queen cried the unfortunate woman				136.26724785449485
d artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son				284.80994271559484
general oliver cromwell the four friends looked at one another				68.7745011614818
halloo he cried are the prisoners still there yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering				650179.6859413396
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery				12065.180257247208
everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack				8404.863292080012
he could already see the intendant s beaming smile change to a contortion of grief				9098.915686633038
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms				60043.626821320686
i don t remember him groslow is the man who broke parry s head and is now getting ready to break ours oh				3933.4464142262777
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it with such a heart as yours and such a sword one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed				720867.5369515849
exordium repeated the curate for the sake of saying something				1340.6317849285751
it was like a besieged town				111736.58492309484
dantès had been flung into the sea and was dragged into its depths by a thirty six pound shot tied to his feet				30.881584816693675
to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friends to athos and aramis was apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety				32032.185076497433
the total amount was found to be as m noirtier had stated				2293421.80031426
this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow				560813.9391445442
what is my daughter doing asked madame danglars				10.706724700286886
splendid lace adorned the falling collar of his shirt and lace fell also over the top of his boots				116102.48649430028
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder				10553.23590581373
i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours				487.35508131260445
he had reflected that in a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger who appeared to be his agent and he judged with reason he had not a moment to lose				339.8408373825578
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances d artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once				51908.10312080937
yes replied m de boville i myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817 and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of soldiers				2189.2560927986815

it is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it is bertuccio bowed				100.29488727993785
six o clock came and although they were not to sit down to table until seven o clock dinner was ready and served up				419.2564000310337
he was a nobleman a man equal to buckingham in every respect				4237.490594005061
i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan				970.7004287156583
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the world				97.92069767872239
about five o clock in the evening the island was distinct and everything on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting				568664.6549319633
teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at luigi who could not refuse his assent				15295.135962279857
i don t care to be shot in a box no said aramis he has not seen us				201.9257290730245
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldn t surprise me at all perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us nonsense				6126211.212115902
monte cristo thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with morrel and his family departed murmuring as he went these lines of pindar youth is a flower of which love is the fruit happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own the carriage was prepared according to orders and stepping lightly into it the count drove off at his usual rapid pace				320.55820832394625
debray continued when you receive this you will no longer have a husband				461.5305215331615
the door of the guardhouse opens as you see yes i see they are about to send into our court which monsieur de mazarin crosses on his way to the orangery the two guards who attend him there they are coming out if only they close the guardhouse door				245.47328761763632
i would rather have had a hat said d artagnan				1.0048152206095067
the count of monte cristo i believe said he				14.137500695752745
one would have said that his gaze could pierce the branches of trees which limited his horizon				2824.3767916734178
danglars left last night left m				464.33594548860054
the sweat streamed down his marble forehead and his hand under his coat tore his breast				158.1831604359638
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors bah				4626.792138656179
i yesterday took the place of another				2276.695193922837
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room				147.2647993923912
you see i destroy it oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness itself listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have done oh command and i will obey listen this is not a command but advice i give you speak and i will follow your advice i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice				1357.5800447470112
then my friends and i took her tried her and condemned her d artagnan then related the poisoning of mme				70.84640751442218
0215m you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place				240.18066954317416
there to his great astonishment d artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into				5867677.8692784775
he acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the englishman paid down on the spot				68153.6787773439
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled and affixed his seal				10873.02988919928
d artagnan put his forty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple on the contrary thanking his majesty greatly				11102.83445895135
the king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the palais royal				9.735337622864762
the generation who follow us are very precocious come beauchamp said château renaud i will bet anything you do not believe a word of all you have been telling us				1505.9909254611284
is it because my opinions differ from yours nothing of the kind sir replied danglars if such had been the case i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these things when i made the engagement				41633.22894624605
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man s eyes				207.65813673103554
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery				683368.5909261855
albert summoned his servant and ordered him to acquaint m and madame de morcerf of the arrival of the count of monte cristo				1.0167291159918803
act then as you think proper there is still time to withdraw no monsieur no you appear to be an honest young man and i will have confidence in you				22.63812300031693
has any horse got loose not likely answered the gascon these marks are regular where is raoul asked athos how is it that i have not seen him hush exclaimed d artagnan putting his finger on his lips and he related what he had seen watching athos all the while				1486089.1233282087
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled				32149.98144106484
and the other which the short one oh he was not a gentleman i ll answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration some lackey murmured d artagnan				1.0056418181939133
compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way				2902.339235082934
the antechamber of m de tréville m de troisville as his family was still called in gascony or m de tréville as he has ended by styling himself in paris had really commenced life as d artagnan now did that is to say without a sou in his pocket but with a fund of audacity shrewdness and intelligence which makes the poorest gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope from the paternal inheritance than the richest perigordian or berrichan gentleman derives in reality from his				5306.950682232733
now said he the sacrifice is consummated				373079.187391847
we are going again it appears to have our hides pierced in all sorts of ways you will take your musketoon and your pistols there now				479.4139912680743
gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m de monte cristo and myself possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life				229.18450942613052
and athos i have not yet seen him				10.818377716032389
edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse heard the voice of the governor who asked them to throw water on the dead man s face and seeing that in spite of this application the prisoner did not recover they sent for the doctor				770.308420914638

the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew it				8.474392419075539

during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life				280.3285999343798
isn t it reasonable yes dear friend athos replied but you said a word the other day that was more than reasonable it was noble and generous				3088.121865659016

through or over coachman gallop on the coachman raised his whip				7504.648105193382
i had the king and monsieur the whole of one day in my care				2533.919282825868
he wore a large brown mantle one fold of which thrown over his left shoulder served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat				1208.9609331235104
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had disappeared				849.7917355733194
you and the wounded man sought to recall the features of the person now before him				3.4056391606127816
i wish to thank them all at once				150.5631863900738
no replied athos and he oh he				223.9759322839888

it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had been ushered into madame de villefort s room who had said she would receive them there				318.47062907787046

it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least ah				839.1107666918344
he remained there some time alone				754.7766882950933
then turning towards albert it is a pity you do not understand either ancient or modern greek both of which haydée speaks so fluently the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian which will give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation the count made a sign to haydée to address his visitor				163107.9779236922

oh my god my god cried mme				20.739164275856695
milady continued one day our doors will ope with god come our desire and if betrays that hope to death we can aspire this verse into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer				441.3482353938063
it had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs				869563.7409886394
i am here what do you want with me and at these words the musketeer in irreproachable costume belted as usual with a tolerably firm step entered the cabinet				218909.23436991137
this was to go himself to m de la trémouille				43922.90728124978
yet thither it was that dantès guided his vessel and at monte cristo he arrived at the close of the second day his boat had proved herself a first class sailor and had come the distance from genoa in thirty five hours				264.5586619900978
you have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door go sir said the queen i will follow you d artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box				3326.9263990034606

had he escaped we should either have seen him or have heard him spoken of you are right aramis let us travel on to describe the impatience and anxiety of these two friends would be impossible				918.9473554017901
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that m danglars trembled too morrel morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this can not be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartism i mean about the year 1815 yes replied m danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner indeed answered maximilian and what did your father say then valentine oh such a dreadful thing that i don t dare to tell you always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile				1333.2673200836473
that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized d artagnan by the arm and said if occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not yes my lord he replied				2245.5425946532514

morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips				1289.3805775900878
he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised winter s head and unfastening the order of the saint esprit placed it on his own breast				315.1260138646866

i thought that we were finally quit of monsieur de beaufort yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water				1264.311472918662
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction				302.0784293988289

if there is a third shot said he to himself i am a lost man he immediately therefore took to his heels and ran toward the camp with the swiftness of the young men of his country so renowned for their agility but whatever might be his speed the first who fired having had time to reload fired a second shot and this time so well aimed that it struck his hat and carried it ten paces from him				2.5441551014336214

well said the queen when the chancellor had finished speaking what do you think of it all i think that matters look very gloomy madame but what step would you propose to me i could propose one to your majesty but i dare not you may you may sir said the queen with a bitter smile you were not so timid once the chancellor reddened and stammered some words				2064.880756701445
a light appeared under the door this light announced the reappearance of her jailers				3995.0843697229134
d artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet				819.2343698105069
the child was born was given to me motionless breathless voiceless we thought it dead madame danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention				61603.7868479517
truly sir you overwhelm me with benefits therefore you love me a little i hope replied athos in a tone of emotion				3743.5044899878944
nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream				894.0605535566398
my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation madame de villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her				6.655562533520678
by the bye continued d artagnan should this man attempt to fly or to call out pass your sword through his body the musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should be obeyed to the letter and d artagnan went out followed by bernouin				3215976.572071056
ah cried d artagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i pant to make a reality of it well merit this pretended happiness then i am at your orders said d artagnan				3197.088657450833

in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them				8.71665046003792
then she rang for her lady s maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might happen				1089.2941309216408
when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil what difference does that make said porthos				6.786388395433851
alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff behind				2340.5395279322865
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness				26542.296323796396
the closet into which d artagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see				1258.1249277315164
sight and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable body which seemed fit for nothing but the grave it was only however by means of one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that still occupied his mind and the look by which he gave expression to his inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees by night across some desert place and knows that a living being dwells beyond the silence and obscurity				1359.9520431637363
this letter had been conveyed by d artagnan and had arrived in time				667.0498879500639
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m franz				72.93801049213978
the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of de luynes				50303.86214338797
it was nearly eight o clock when they set out again				245.59622171445605
in another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept				3531.3903710214913
you would have done what i did mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength				6215.2085691614375
lord de winter continued the officer who commands here in my absence you have already seen and therefore know him				80.10810822214677
extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning i scarcely knew her these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart				487.2140415945786
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so much				759.4475397463941
at six o clock lord de winter came in				402.72226136752175
well how much for the equipments if we say one hundred pistoles for the three good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and fifty porthos made a sign of assent				244.75996511408866
and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own				13498.502264379844
oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day i was torn from her i loved				9822.570468613596
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring				1710.6565620365309
de morcerf said the president do you recognize this lady as the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina no said morcerf attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my enemies haydée whose eyes had been fixed on the door as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the count standing shrieked you do not know me said she				528.0433541684524
his reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of him				47.94794749995356
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me alas continued athos the poor abbé was not a st ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature monsieur cried the duchess seizing athos s hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you athos laughed				26505.643542960734

and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to you my love for you				5.346436292328924
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition				3555.1624735014525
descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it				23.91965482489469
no be assured i am not mad				104.52467024122217
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone				14443.49060655419
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbé busoni it was your excellency the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me				14.515107040496297
he had gained much information but not enough				1107.9843861311647
charles stuart said the colonel of the english regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner colonel tomlison said charles kings can not yield the man alone submits to force your sword the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee				43866.8130118867

i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains				4785.79648873694
therefore athos had invented the phrase family affair				422.8667644599847
two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea				210.7546490888178
in the midst of this tumult the voice of the president was heard to exclaim are you playing with justice accused and do you dare set your fellow citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never been equalled several persons hurried up to m de villefort who sat half bowed over in his chair offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy				11558.726816102737
i heard it from m debray who was present at the explanation valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer				158.89475630968045
ah sir said d artagnan you have a wicked smile				101.53448773636796
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no suspicion of it				6.020100941037958
you were walking one day behind the chartreux when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere				4748.344815191737
it appears to me that this cavalier has made you very angry				1764.4293447022512
this is quite another man and does not resemble him at all				222.93906846358215
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne				23652.592972605453
where does he live rue férou two steps from here let us go both resumed their way				504.12444032670396
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honoré				5275.256915075607
at last charged with murders with debauchery hated by every one and yet threatening still like a panther thirsting for blood she fell under the blows of men whom she had rendered desperate though they had never done her the least injury she met with judges whom her hideous crimes had evoked and that executioner you saw that executioner who you say told you everything that executioner if he told you everything told you that he leaped with joy in avenging on her his brother s shame and suicide				22528.259713196418
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast				7082.8036910691635
order was re established in the hall except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one another				62.970228319507875
besides he doesn t know you like his mates he is ready to obey our orders knowing nothing of our plan very well let us go they then went down to the thames				9638480.528061636
it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep yes sire said aramis yes you are right				41.36279603113681
the witnesses endeavored to insist but the president bade them be silent				217.86359831185206
at nine o clock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to m de villefort s house				263.73818667276817
at last raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet again				935.5008890862534
the young man burst into a laugh				1445.2825306420903
she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration				201029.97337254288
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch s blood fell down insensible				14678.163775579005
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue				4768.093254517242
thank god we can keep a secret the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker				26271.449548133874
to nobody in the world not even to athos or porthos i have not breathed a syllable to them good enough tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with d artagnan and both soon arrived at athos s dwelling				1946862.2022365385
monsieur d artagnan sides with mazarin				755.2137401465895
oh you are so kind and i am so grateful how can i avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so amiable				118936.39658506148
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room				104.3351962369681
do you see whispered aramis to athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt				2745.7996038845154

now my dear guitant i have often remarked that in addition to your courage which is indisputable and your fidelity which is invincible you possess an admirable memory you have found that out have you my lord				166.09220834203836
i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet m and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this				372.0507201670516

thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the chimney corner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as no				891.3005551856754
milady had then made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a man horribly prejudiced against her and by her beauty in the heart of a man hitherto chaste and pure				4590.540988691304
how did this happen said morrel				43.750370446162925

d artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck				2158.03798205843
how very singular cried monte cristo with well feigned astonishment				23.72977627155477

my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk				4427073.69872665
during this time in the kiosk at my father s feet were seated twenty palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats				3400086.427093112
he listened to know whence this sound could proceed				423816.17550090275
but milady felt herself denounced even by his terror				3034.350409282538
pardon my frankness too my lord i am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence				17998.886710463892

the young man s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie				1553.1213887017861
well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel				622.5705555165162
no no cried bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall				338.68981424366353

one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat				5018.983701600085
why replied athos carelessly she is probably going to write to the cardinal that a damned musketeer named athos has taken her safe conduct from her by force she will advise him in the same letter to get rid of his two friends aramis and porthos at the same time				30.530820947365516

remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said richelieu significantly that it was i who came to seek you and that i did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling you i shall entertain whatever may happen said d artagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your eminence for that which you now do for me well let it be then as you have said monsieur d artagnan we shall see each other again after the campaign				16793576.739033066

you are running your heads into a very silly affair you will be riddled				662300.5982334658
little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark				1586.7284364223503
he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them				33.95539593518002
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer				261.61614100959446
it is very well for you who risk your life every day but for me who only did so once we gather from all this baron that captain morrel saved your life exactly so on what occasion asked beauchamp				65.1983995116933
morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed				8721.42417630542
you may be easy then you ll get there d artagnan then saw a musket barrel leveled at him he had no time to draw from his holsters				35813.08919671091
and since i do not give it said the musketeer				242.94383294736684
at three o clock came two companies of the guards one french the other swiss				4873.011856255413
at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed				1134190.9006854484
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips				1114.2139153173146

the marquis de saint méran i think the concierge said				279.2117363322233
one evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crew to the island of elba the boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning franz disembarked at porto ferrajo				650488.5489941001
coquenard was not less affected by it on her part for she added my cousin will not return if he finds that we do not treat him kindly but otherwise he has so little time to pass in paris and consequently to spare to us that we must entreat him to give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure oh my legs my poor legs				241296.9397859204
in his youth d artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities besides he had the cardinal s hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word				177.75760908328482
you see in me such as i am a person sentenced to be hung and on what account i rescued from the hands of mazarin s police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile where he had been for five years will you name him oh you know him well my lord it is count de rochefort ah				51.14301193633549
you told me that your instinct and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations i think on the contrary that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs well you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern				1216511.0171031652
such a thing is really out of rule eccentric or stupid				59712.53757643646
do you know i always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel dear good renée whispered villefort as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker				30704.273781489803
i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal oh no certainly not well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me but this secret is not mine and i can not reveal it in this manner you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan with chagrin				665697.2834061094
first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle you				12.24718933635544
i know that it is terrible said d artagnan but when i reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scene again before me as if i now were there				233.9737146239707
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister				4198.752130399798
to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death				490.8908631580639
then lackeys who ask questions inspire less mistrust than masters and meet with more sympathy among those to whom they address themselves				617.5242305535563
porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after him				7.604706617113927
yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain				7576.596494000658
the duke more and more bewildered let grimaud loose and took the note				80966.61148411586
i detest her from antipathy or rather by instinct perhaps so				74.83949578622789
but my dear count has m danglars any reason ah				217.24801332307382
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me				3157.6664774058677
how soft and perfumed was the air how lovely the blue heavens and star enameled sky				13305.193022957774

everything considered you are very well off here				120.49943330406583
it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor man what then is this monsieur scarron who thus puts all paris in commotion				432413.9038465957
there s no second constance in the world on his return to the cathedral d artagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the sacristan				2531773.3448620946
how should i know what horse furniture is you should have left it to me then madame who know what they are but you wished to be frugal and consequently to lend at usury it was wrong monsieur porthos but i will repair that wrong upon my word of honor how so asked the musketeer				18037.996853548277

if i only were a a baron don t you mean cried d artagnan finishing his friend s sentence				11954.654283270766
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you				8.407502004075754
d artagnan therefore returned to the rue férou				91.2244822735806
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity				1676.0239216241346
about five minutes replied the captain				54.9671799278155
as for monte cristo his eyes slowly rose towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude				2546.166781040347

then internally if renée could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator well when we quitted naples captain leclere was attacked with a brain fever				1271.9638669822905

he still lives are you quite sure of it i am he there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature				4361.392080165241
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but misfortune it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud				20709.5198597892
ah my dear fellow said he to franz you did not see what there that calash filled with roman peasants no well i am convinced they are all charming women how unfortunate that you were masked albert said franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments oh replied he half laughing half serious i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other but in spite of albert s hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants				2630.191999606061

on the morning of the departure from the forest of frosinone he had followed carlini in the darkness and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise man anticipated it				11.351675980423087

in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton ah sir				48.96723633402575
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time				1180.7391636784268
what i have always wished for desired and coveted is the life of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself				1400.97016940832

meanwhile villefort and d avrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold				742068.3659272835
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree 30069m well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on				13934.124882786473
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all oh cried the executioner all				13327.04841409025

the night was cold and still the family had all retired to rest but villefort who alone remained up and worked till five o clock in the morning reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates compiling the depositions of the witnesses and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered				46657.51892756374

as for me i must look after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning the owner did not wait for a second invitation				1928.8599174723531
yes for an instant i hoped it was so				176.88620068089293
i said i wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man				1.197702644717423
there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom				20693.05479409962
they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning				8794.354941165331
all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement				20451.973403455817
very well take blaisois with whom i know not what to do since i already have grimaud willingly said aramis				23.04124677356708
yes since she lives at that moment d avrigny s glance met noirtier s eye				1046.9337267609499
listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him one takes away from him all claim to good sense another robs him of his poetry a third of his originality another of his humor another of his independence of character a sixth but good heavens				10831.54894454111
meanwhile as the little troop drew nearer to lens the noise of the cannon sounded louder				529072.4677471182
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose				961.8333196577341
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp				269151.2772919837
nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dantès the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmond s time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them				11.818166373380738
at the left of the opening was a dark and deep angle				357479.32577652344
it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad				365.81412842898044
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf				2989.980647359268
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll				1408980.1372482835
d artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat				290.7235506854293
what is there then behind this wall				198.78407034989615
you are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph but viscount since we can not perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting do not fear i have little to prepare monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation				1925258.041532918
renée regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover				6025.526540140125
i willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon me				3.747729029741276
there is a proposition almost like it in the augustinus of the heresiarch jansenius whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the executioner				816.2167673698009
my friend monsieur du vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day				963.6696218024671
milady oh yes said porthos true i had forgotten it athos looked at him intently				2071756.1050751568
30 the son whom you had by the marchesa corsinari and who was taken from you at five years of age				3568.1376782004086
i should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times				3796.966223017648
take care of your horses cried d artagnan to him				73.09036471778903
you seemed at dinner to be anxious about something i was trying said porthos to recall where i had seen that mendicant whom i must have killed and you couldn t remember no well search my friend search and when you have found you will tell me will you not pardieu said porthos				12.953222819649858
you are a man of taste				18124.76723531999
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud				1454.3152622249406
but what is this that i hear from her majesty the queen of england				45.12595322420703
the boat they were in could not make a long voyage there was no vessel at anchor outside the harbor he thought perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant point				2922.0202914347597
you know that my means are limited and that i am what would be designated a man of moderate pretensions				556481.4916609813
i shall tell him therefore and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me				5.50155379484127
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door				8.338886698048977
your eminence said comminges as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door				22.6239270276694
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women				564.1119709466452
every one was full of curiosity as to who that unknown executioner could be who presented himself so opportunely to assure to the people the promised spectacle when the people believed it had been postponed until the following day				32.21397700553055
everything was ready at ten o clock for the departure and as athos was watching raoul mount a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse				79.15160549614902
yesterday i was at the house of a doctor of theology whom i sometimes consult about my studies athos smiled				17.427545257989223
ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there				236.65418516892456
d artagnan determined upon his course				1123.4412542125576
just so muttered comminges looking after mazarin				343.80365514238537
to answer you would be to acknowledge you as my judges and i only acknowledge you as my executioners and in the middle of a deathlike silence charles calm lofty and with his head still covered sat down again in his arm chair				113.0873872294768
they were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa				275978.4547696997
when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching				16810.568264984693
well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal a gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a telegraph the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort who bent his head in modest triumph				8131.106555969721
i am finishing the most execrable morning s work what is it said albert arranging your papers apparently my papers thank god no my papers are all in capital order because i have none but m cavalcanti s m				135.86686238349844
but i have seen things so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might mercédès was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived her of edmond				1620.2056751339962
it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate				525485.1336344823
de guiche who was young and impulsive said to raoul here we are three masters and three servants				7672.043213760862
so i think and therefore i said were our object money only but we want something else replied the gascon				39.96642711908371
i ask much too much perhaps for i have no title to request it				16.168171325824293
he credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends				83.45931950589144
where asked porthos filling a second glass of wine				186.04780314535262
the mercer had said that he was rich the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m bonacieux and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of it				66.44480183106627
and i must take care of it for him since i only lend him my name and raoul what shall you do with him i leave him with you my friend				48.25316907262951
but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred names that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire				747.7842824349997
baron danglars is a good father and knows how to calculate in that case said andrea everything is all right excepting your refusal which quite grieves me you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar circumstances well said andrea let it be as you wish				371.4418238358184
well said porthos to aramis we must do something monsieur is full of generosity said athos				6.333929395588598
at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round and looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal				939.1905495983016
if you will help me to drag myself from under my horse i hope nothing need prevent us continuing our journey monsieur d arminges and olivain had already dismounted and were attempting to raise the struggling horse				71293.84770603917
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to d artagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed				753.8968724516894
in fact d artagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests				6580.652546967199
the devil exclaimed the gascon tis a dreadful night my lord				55.57850447926659
the first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the prince de condé with the princess and dowager princess				5711.724003185762
from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anything d artagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart				27.839246552764344
i am the queen do you recognize me no madame replied d artagnan				1.0095406768812547
how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason				3010.4038590341484
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth				456.2409758733897
she will repent and no one will know that she has been guilty				420.4279483064955
bonacieux the comtesse de winter the four friends uttered one and the same cry but that of athos dominated all the rest				885.3289260188053
oh sir i beg your pardon exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention in an instant i shall be dressed athos then called olivain				10241.48988865418
that is your road excellency and now you can not again mistake and here is your recompense said the traveller offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money				736.3879232875041
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear				309.085157306495
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated				296668.43304432806
oh man man race of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do i recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves meanwhile andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming he ought to die he shall die i will not die alone look look cried the count seizing the young men s hands look for on my soul it is curious				26443.154884405627
here doctor said he is what you sent me for was this prepared in your presence yes replied the procureur				544.3243430804392
he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come but she added poor angel whom that monster of a gascon barely failed to kill the monster was himself				1761.4156977660489
this separation which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded				10966.25349790001
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat				647.633695977016
non capisco do not understand was the reply				465.1192991777797
now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust yet five minutes afterwards the rabbit was dead				425.94564844482386
he brings an irreproachable name which maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the legion of honor the old man signified that he recollected him				7.520353708279926
he had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large cloak				88.5551825045927
you can not think of going out in such weather as this oh i am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller				7153.129096168951
here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy looking room separated by a wall from the vault itself				12580.331834364106
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears				972376.6166837055
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did				721.8543223953029
a fine thing indeed grunted porthos				200.59369657525252
i am just setting out for blois				35229.32305345864
as soon as they had disappeared behind a green curtain sufficiently thick to conceal them from the sight of any one who might be in pursuit they drew up to hold a council together				2107.6922820097975
ten minutes sufficed for their defeat and d artagnan remained master of the field of battle				30.94043232247294
monsieur said d artagnan i beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat				2639.9172363041707
if i am not yet a musketeer said he to his new friends as he passed through the gateway of m de tréville s hôtel at least i have entered upon my apprenticeship haven t i chapter vi				15764.530762194752
la chesnaye louis xiii s confidential valet who never left the door entered in reply to the call				4250.912377832257
it is his way and you must take him as you find him at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act				5272.1336653736225
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran s morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear				2404.215338140483
the valet then left the room				6.8153564441294066
you can understand that one of two things must have happened he must either have fallen flat in which case the blow from a height of ninety feet must have killed him instantly or he must have fallen upright and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom where he remained poor fellow then you pity him said the count				9.35837681467421
i am young and strong i believe i am courageous and since yesterday i have learned the power of will				1181.4989224055594
god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause				770.3007074080122
m bonacieux who was ignorant that d artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m de laffemas whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinal s executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture				562084.5370538889
therefore he knew nothing either of the enemy s numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army				233.68292779348806
they broke open the doors and searched the dwelling but in vain				668.0391953802163
the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive				1287892.455575713
what is the matter my dear m mouston asked d artagnan				91.86752514110937
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword				126.2519765811327
dantès saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand				8.296816659884348
now guess what the young one did tell me he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body				585.1890109841428
and they separated with courteous gestures				12724.461821855413
besides athos was very easy and a noble to his fingers ends				267583.9340135255
god alone knows what country will see me die				150.48990243220706
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water it was the general s body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead				329.4074948015833
you were going to visit monsieur de la fere said d artagnan				1.0065430401952489
i do not wish it said the eye of her grandfather				9546.227497968142
aramis less self controlled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard				51525.32534709238
nevertheless when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths				718591.4777461629
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants				6649.802372956914
those were the count s windows why he must be a nabob				22641.70389755783
oh come gentlemen my master is ill the three friends hastened toward d artagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse				191.4499226897455
indeed count said madame danglars i am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that i must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a chair				188.65971354326237
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before then meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos				12.479278486062189
let us do justice to d artagnan				1.0179239509244804
grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastion something he had till then doubted he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat				2019.359420711825
athos went down to pay the reckoning while d artagnan and planchet stood at the street door				62.13510236683549
who could intercept us on such a night as this pitch dark when one does not see more than twenty yards before one yes but to morrow morning to morrow we shall be at boulogne i hope so with all my heart said the gascon and i confess my weakness				8071.054247307055
each one went out by the open doors				99429.68233763051
the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life perhaps franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment				248.34837457684785
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry i am very much in a hurry aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of him				4.56219083180293
a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtues don t you think so				18.376154920688283
i saw madame de saint méran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said château renaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body				13003.847138936007
be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most advantages eh eh said bonacieux slapping a plump round bag which returned of sound a money what do you think of this madame preacher whence comes that money you do not guess from the cardinal from him and from my friend the comte de rochefort the comte de rochefort				173.75134029865762
you ask what i have against you i tell you				2.446539116446362
the whole assembly manifested great surprise but andrea appeared quite unmoved				13594.411837977168
besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of athos				24.933131234022504
for a moment d artagnan thought that parry s brother had disappeared but he was mistaken				435.13897983632296
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force				2621.2299306469017
fernand was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow countrymen found danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor destiny				6368.310399075273
yes shall i give these papers to m de villefort no to mademoiselle valentine no to m franz d épinay yes franz astonished advanced a step				1155.5458511806212
no one at villefort s doubted that a duel would ensue from it				5.63896985950215
do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it i shall never forget it replied d artagnan				1.0071849821713221
one morning my father sent for us my mother had been crying all the night and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than usual				1736.8706529585222
exactly and you have that letter of the cardinal said d artagnan				1.0064215658784796
villefort is no longer at marseilles he is now at toulouse i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured dantès since my only protector is removed had m de villefort any cause of personal dislike to you none on the contrary he was very kind to me i can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you entirely that is well wait patiently then dantès fell on his knees and prayed earnestly				8561187.637573
i do not know i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells yes sir a rope ladder and tools and have you them yet no sir i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but i have still something left what is it asked the count impatiently				5235.018254722481
he said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to buckingham palace				17043.78267734989
have you by any chance been in the bastile no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it ah				213.5226312814366
in that case you must be horribly bored and have my sympathy the fact is i look to my turn for keeping guard with horror				7361.53775605281
then he had made himself another enemy less to be feared he thought but nevertheless he instinctively felt not to be despised				1155.7409241931018
some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel come when he will it shall be kept for him				12.044379363937747
on two occasions her fortune has failed her on two occasions she has found herself discovered and betrayed and on these two occasions it was to one fatal genius sent doubtlessly by the lord to combat her that she has succumbed				655966.8842508966
she had already decided upon seeing him and urging his immediate departure when on the very evening of coming to this decision mme				253.9657707784928
the antechamber of m de tréville chapter iii				164189.05277500194
i have what is still better				351.00810914348045
he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd				1129.2207213975253
repeat your father s name said the president				115.90373008432292

fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation				4851.278727669122

what is his name said he				5.885470500983557
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs				12411.825332547998
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed la ramee				6.743488968954055

this was before his servant came				1884.6820212631928
the man was m de villefort i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone 20291m and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman no excellency returned bertuccio you will see that i had no time to learn it go on that evening continued bertuccio i could have killed the procureur but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden				1713.4918512099798

morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre stay he said m				353.90349986958876
besides maximilian morrel though hardly two and twenty had great influence over his father				128.9820825896493
on the landing they were no longer fighting but amused themselves with stories about women and in the antechamber with stories about the court				830.6242325241636
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title				7153.872706167201

but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of d artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer				369.9236746111605
i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin				3169.559700318342

there was a third point in view which will appear hereafter				5742.189022504403
so much the worse sir said anne of austria so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion what exclaimed d artagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or position does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it				100.72085192527976
my mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside				8347.333438944692

and the royal carriage drove on followed by the other coaches and about fifty horsemen				1666.6509491071813
le blanc was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace in three hours and a half andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compiègne and four o clock struck as he reached the place where the coaches stop				3215.747780640739
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy				761.1815976524197

parbleu at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your apartments but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar sum every day it is not that which deterred me replied monte cristo but as i determined to have a house to myself i sent on my valet de chambre and he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it but you have then a valet de chambre who knows paris said beauchamp				1917.2097923948731

what did he say to me				3.9261267099622437
then turning toward that one of the guards who had declared himself the friend of bois tracy besides continued he i have reflected my dear intimate of bois tracy that i am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be so that decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket as mine no upon my honor cried his majesty s guardsman				3313802.982517941

during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges guitant and villequier mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man				18336.789862678765
bravo cried d artagnan you sing charmingly dear aramis				53.89583250446445

some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minute s air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice will there be another funeral today at the procureur s house madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell				5625.6232067382525
at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the table yes monsieur that purse contained sixty pistoles where is it deposited with the justice they said it was bad money very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold of				3493.062194050783

ah it is you peppino said the count				8.803437658443652
