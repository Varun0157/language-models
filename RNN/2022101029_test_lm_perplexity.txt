ah if i were but twenty years old yes said athos doubtless you would commit great follies				275257.720778056
there will be eleven crowns gained it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d artagnan s purse				2529.4864088735394

for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments				28740.614800455052
ah these musketeers of yours are very devils fellows to be hanged no sire replied tréville who saw at the first glance how things would go on the contrary they are good creatures as meek as lambs and have but one desire i ll be their warranty				152670.46646063752
i had acted hastily towards him				12.782104567828188

it was no longer the same man the fearful revelations of the three last days had crushed him				142.3817498183086
he took his fowling piece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids				163871.0281703763
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell				2960.78536715631
they might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their abstraction				262264.7868059139
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died				9154.315323205501
indeed i expected it for it is a family inheritance both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack				8024.276158444809
well said she hardly giving franz time to sit down it seems you have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord ruthven and you are already the best friends in the world without being so far advanced as that my dear countess returned franz i can not deny that we have abused his good nature all day all day yes this morning we breakfasted with him we rode in his carriage all day and now we have taken possession of his box you know him then yes and no how so it is a long story tell it to me it would frighten you too much so much the more reason at least wait until the story has a conclusion very well i prefer complete histories but tell me how you made his acquaintance				9870.950756374812
d artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat				2888.7159412022293
grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the lys				7263.751449056847
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes				3726.9012567205486
at the end of the dinner he entered in person				1556.7708338762882

raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old				1880.8332877168862
milady s secret d artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to kitty s chamber as she endeavored to persuade him to do and that for two reasons the first because by this means he should escape reproaches recriminations and prayers the second because he was not sorry to have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring if possible to fathom those of this woman				607.7712770527573
unless i die i shall always be what i am and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard even from the mouths of kings for kings have need and other persons have fear of you				186.85534451466842

yes monsieur said d artagnan bowing we have had that honor				1040.4858103707786
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand				415.2426105643638
his bright eyes kindled and his mouth so finely formed assumed a wicked smile every blow he aimed was sure and his pistol finished the deed annihilated the wounded wretch who tried to rise again				273.7465407026298
sir he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and well studied course oh yes yes i do sir it is the pede claudo of the ancients				38290.22441544402
this miserable strain confines me to my bed but mousqueton forages and brings in provisions				5358.692953206793
he opened his eyes upon utter darkness				988.5759831163263
i concluded that by some singular chance the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself but as i entered my apartments i beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider				150905.90467040913

you will restore them to her majesty and as a last memorial he looked round for some valuable object you will add he still sought but his eyes darkened by death encountered only the knife which had fallen from the hand of felton still smoking with the blood spread over its blade				197409.98489727834
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence and d artagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends				438.9164609944675
he again struck it and with greater force				2515.9871087013207
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinal s hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin				1092.746434118443

they went on board and the captain instantly conducted them to the berth prepared for them a cabin which was to serve for all purposes and for the whole party he then tried to slip away under pretext of giving orders to some one				428.867770221301
then turning toward planchet he made him a sign to uncock his musketoon				101059.63935626937

he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations				166218.59464041927

of what asked the priest anxiously and eagerly				1964.1337496246902

m d épinay to whom i had promised the interest of this sum shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations however said madame de villefort returning to the one idea which incessantly occupied her mind perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky affair to m d épinay in order to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the hand of mademoiselle de villefort ah that would be a great pity said villefort				94.82598148012845

ah he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still thank god good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty				3478.657697236423
as he alighted he thought he saw his father s pale face behind the curtain of the count s bedroom				4570.843504186019
what is to be done my god my god murmured the young woman ought i to confide such a secret to you monsieur				916.3932067407976
he made his way along the corridors through force of habit he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of nessus insatiate in torture				25577.08748223369
but for the moment let us do as did the amorous gascon we will see after the worthy mercer later				18029.91354933116
at eleven o clock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved court and the rue du faubourg saint honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess				7321.706227332488
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud				7503.295555953137
pray tell me how i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oil here is my lamp so saying the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations				123329.89325389953
there the great number of inns puzzled them they could not go to all how could they guess in which those whom they were seeking had stayed				192628.00236047845
however it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies apprised in time of the visit paid him monte cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants				4313.059902763672

it is a veritable army my faith yes said athos there they are				1996.48899121314
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life				540.0337829437458
yes madame well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes i am sorry to say i can not replied the baron and i was just asking the same question of albert are you very anxious to know countess asked albert				539.7222879234743
my heart beat so violently that i feared my wound would open				2474.202736015435
and a little bit of a thief oh sir				412.0150961953902
aramis continued and yet while i do belong to the earth i wish to speak of you of our friends and on my part said d artagnan i wished to speak of you but i find you so completely detached from everything				625.9240335223743
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview say no more of that madame said felton				262.9869612731272
meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone				1219.0903359104996
alas replied he it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own lips				634.8139395195592
your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but i foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters in that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them perhaps it will be too late said gondy still unmoved perhaps i shall have lost all influence while by giving up broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt have i not then that right cried the queen				334.671978249461
nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed				39041.11221265182
that has cured me of beautiful poetical and loving women said athos after a considerable pause raising his head and forgetting to continue the fiction of the count				545.9211212583343
she advanced some steps towards the staircase and listened				4442.876865604144
in every country where independence has taken the place of liberty the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared				512917.3826829571
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself				199.99486339575984
i could almost believe myself at the café de paris murmured danglars				132.10781305688855
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation				2438.363213875251
my son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here				477.12703849367665
they both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moonlight				133885.3342988645
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer s eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarin s purpose				2195.038674268108
this is what i propose to do said athos				22.16825748655766
no one could guess what the dirty rag could be i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man				72.04798143676223
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenant s sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal				25241.813684747274
be this evening about ten o clock at st				8696.955509846595
reports were whispered about like certain sounds which announce as they whistle from wave to wave the coming storm and when they pass athwart a multitude presage an emeute				144014.64691685606
he was a brave and an honest man and a first rate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars				113.16053218225888
anne had never at the louvre had so large a court but this crowd represented chiefly the second class of nobility while the prince de conti the duc de beaufort and the coadjutor assembled around them the first nobility of france				635.3302577781088
we have arranged the ransom of each of them 2 000 on arriving in france				355.864437831033
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all				806.7664103703303
yes yours your own property sir my right hand correspondent is signalling let him signal sir you have distracted me i shall be fined that will cost you a hundred francs you see it is your interest to take my bank notes sir my right hand correspondent redoubles his signals he is impatient never mind take these and the count placed the packet in the man s hands				452.206997341794
i wish to consult you about some thing do so do you think it is time for us to enter the service but are you not still in the service you d artagnan i mean active service				1103.3116947872732
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious				6857.527453682923
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir				410.6072874849449
it is a chain of recollections an idea which carries you back to other times to other places which very likely have no connection with the present time and place				888.1178620069155
but this i know that i had a mother that five men leagued against one woman murdered her clandestinely by night silently like cowards				18057.118819796575
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak				677.7773592233308
30043m a quarter of an hour was the reply				1036.1867128899853
julie trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen				183439.3541337888
they deputed ten of their number to wait upon the duke of orleans who according to his custom affected popularity				1078168.9319722624
yes the priest oh i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night before was it ever known who this miserable fellow was he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady				2533.6897225197104
m d avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison and you honest man have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret				1438.5465329760268
she was a perfect linguist a first rate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellow a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer				320706.8476757611
it could be seen that she had wished to speak but she had remained silent through fear of losing one of her companion s words				744.9357248589681
when all had gone out and the door was closed m de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man				142.3651849121893
have you the diamond continued athos				59.104360010213476
la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted				4168.5929015061365
in the meantime the cortege returned to the palais royal				3143.25385394564
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse the three friends remained mute for although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances				2280.0554718746807
my death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner be silent madame cried felton and do not speak to me thus i came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor to swear to me by what you hold most sacred that you will make no attempt upon your life i will not promise said milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than i have and if i make a promise i must keep it well said felton only promise till you have seen me again				276.9320430994469
and after this reasoning she slept easily				15178.916304204507
it was a melancholy sight that of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastisement				23027.404127686248
and you believe he died of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse				189.38194161671808
accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following				22189.654355327242
it is twenty years since i saw them and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them and these men were your friends one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me				79.61659396287158
accomplish the orders of lord de winter said felton with a gloomy smile				729.3011829270181
begone and may god guide you amen cried the young man and set off at full gallop				2186.1442970961098
it was a quarter past midday				19504.673561988096
well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his paleness				10975.68041652132
you have an opportunity now count do not allow it to escape d artagnan became very pale he was wounded in his self love he thought that it was in his love				742.9814242501402
aramis at this movement drew his sword				881.9000635733705
porthos followed him by the same road but with more difficulty and less diligence				139280.2054631539
blaisois returned disconsolate to the hotel of the grand roi charlemagne and when athos inquired if his commission was executed he related his adventure				3082.1021425700255
andrea on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy five thousand livres per annum				230706.0899021326
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling				3500.6823856442743
athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the musketeer that he might come in				491.4738217165367
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly				473700.604374635
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak				662.2266393999745
something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more melancholy				10590.21658468312
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from life in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents				18318.24519406293
it came from my brother the king of spain				5329.947403872978
in order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife s and daughter s jewels and a portion of his plate				10485.939730401757
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind				670.07716895729
no country can say it saw my birth				16567.599652639547
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses				1784.9640074570714
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing				160756.04427866125
the cold sweat sprang forth on dantès brow				815.6592307166948
we have a precious fellow here monsieur grimaud said the duke for your sake i beg of you never come within the reach of my fist hush				8423.520010882234
my young man said d artagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed				2616.5420037366616
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est d artagnan whose erudition we are well acquainted with evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham				775.4128930971833
but what do you think of the music what music why the music you have been listening to oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late diogenes from which it would seem my dear count that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise 30097m you are right in some degree when i wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to i go to sleep then sleep here my dear count				215.83631118765547
this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to dantès like a scaffold to a malefactor				132475.52806495078
monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when pistache would have learned a few new tricks				150414.37341421453
now jump down athos athos jumped and disappeared on the other side of the wall				1214.3462387583152
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his grace s lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written				162475.48901695153
well we are going to give a ball to mazarin i hope so and when will the dance begin the invitations are given for this evening said the coadjutor but the violins will not begin to play until to morrow morning you may reckon upon me and upon fifty soldiers which the chevalier d humieres has promised me whenever i need them upon fifty soldiers yes he is making recruits and he will lend them to me if any are missing when the fete is over i shall replace them good my dear rochefort but that is not all				752.9132419120098
i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers				182437.41196879896
had his and these two powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring not only from all the provinces of france but even from all foreign states the most celebrated swordsmen				153314.49016714114
look at the writing and find if you can any blemish in the language or orthography the writing was in reality charming and the orthography irreproachable				163230.59888126707
alas said valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead m				369.5425086902583
it is not your fault my good ali said the count in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing either in voice or face it is not your fault				12475.623584799894
do you know about that institution i have heard of it it is a magnificent charity having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies				14619845.907857142
it is one of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he possesses fortune a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render valentine supremely happy his name moreover can not be wholly unknown to you				48.794464438487836
it was written and signed by albert				561.4654236745839
you don t know him no did you never see him yes i have seen him but i don t know what he calls himself your name replied the commissary				2809.8074552267876
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew				4896.065537760221
the cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others				1290.998580552317
it is not very difficult to say tell us then d artagnan we are going to reach the nearest seaport unite our little resources hire a vessel and return to france				369.72757719601395

on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags				369999.03773430316

a black satin stock fresh from the maker s hands gray moustaches a bold eye a major s uniform ornamented with three medals and five crosses in fact the thorough bearing of an old soldier such was the appearance of major bartolomeo cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted				12055.254446445562
i owe you my real good my present happiness and all the sovereigns of the earth even cæsar borgia himself could not deprive me of this thus if not actually happy yet the days these two unfortunates passed together went quickly				1263.2671295737696
mother nanette began by picking up the louis then she picked up friquet				11800.626449074618
certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence				1006.6573472556034
until this day and for how long a time he had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness				2699.8741651437967
i tell you what my dear fellow said château renaud i can not imagine what objection you can possibly have to mademoiselle danglars that is setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank which by the way i don t think you care very much about				9443.21125246861
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the cellar				3495.0048491283474
he recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all hearts				7852.175559333705
if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received				2998.3185371827362
now madame continued debray first opening the closet then the chest now madame here are 800 notes of 1 000 francs each resembling as you see a large book bound in iron to this i add a certificate in the funds of 25 000 francs then for the odd cash making i think about 110 000 francs here is a check upon my banker who not being m danglars will pay you the amount you may rest assured madame danglars mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank notes				5330.598071930996
yes if my friends agree but if they refuse can i count on you i have never accomplished anything alone said d artagnan shaking his head				314.9460492481299
in the name of heaven cried the poor tutor				10425.384217329496
in 2001 the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg™ and future generations				36909.34657880396
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room and went to open the door himself				445.6645146464352
you still confide then in sinbad the sailor asked he smiling				742.7865951662218
and why so asked porthos warmly				3656.702605639585
d artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life				578.637274164473
i can imagine the effect i do not see the means i will find the means myself you are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable oh				916.9824320988225
who is he come come you won t tell me you don t know aramis this is the first time i ever heard his name pronounced it is the first time then that you ever went to that house undoubtedly and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man no by a musketeer no indeed it was not he then you came to seek not the least in the world				928.9309816614629
surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that no replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself				2832.0232972599706
the will as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things				3163.996723513322
meanwhile fernand made his appearance poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant place and this was by mere chance placed next to the seat on which poor mercédès had fallen half fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantès				818.2684928467997
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared				641.0399953915293
you think he is tracked pursued captured he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles				139818.26551804837
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away				568.0431693517115
i place no confidence in their hypocritical faces				24762.68312520534
a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but i am content				41884.040610070006
the coadjutor went to him and held out his hand				351.70943519518187
oh said monte cristo i allow of no excuse				4260.043639510684
the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out and the moment the door closed they have seen each other said he approaching the cardinal eagerly				1851.4043911629494
porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon and the swiss				4587.6962478176365
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself all is not lost for that order is not signed				11235.586142438295
then steer for monte cristo the captain gave his orders the helm was put up and the boat was soon sailing in the direction of the island				7883.915545326242
a man like danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction				319383.725326083
when your turn comes i shall have the honor to inform you of it				94.75406922812898
m and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfather s presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid				4194.181775188165
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe				19247.36545415115
oh spare me that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same m de villefort started from his seat then in a moment fell down again silent and motionless				2793.1907554331196
non siete spagnuolo he said non siete tedesco siete italiano the prisoner started and bit his lips				740.9432113667323
were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million				13128.94301969273
when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodière he arrived at m danglars door just at the same time that villefort s landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own house				695.9926552753435
there monsieur there is that letter cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice take it and deliver me from your odious presence the chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and retired				1439.6863513036617
remain here and i will send you your clothes by the boy				1854.1166284014837
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him				21.02981335350167
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor				155839.37614977517
count he inquired have you any relations no sir i am alone in the world so much the worse why asked monte cristo				6.5812873710087665
m de tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the king and then for himself and his own friends				543.9029904313924
the house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers				2615.875835735682
if you venture again into the house in which i have met you this evening i will dare it myself i really think i must have been frightened				14705.219180458176
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one				596.7433500717273
impossible impossible but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his hand the acceptance receipted the splendid diamond				1679.525631338496
you ask what god is doing				3118.21886887522
you are pale it is this answered athos with a trembling voice				466.5266612371583
give up this letter you have brought from elba and pass your word you will appear should you be required and go and rejoin your friends				435.9000971527297
in the king s name cried comminges				1718.5905015242358
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame				2864.051210702176
you who speak english like john bull himself are master tom lowe we your three companions				3483.8302141404283
at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door				249.41574681452
of this however be assured that should any favorable opportunity present itself i will not fail to offer you the choice of being present for shame m de villefort said renée becoming quite pale don t you see how you are frightening us and yet you laugh what would you have				5011.565365320063
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers				202981.67269948486
the worthy shipowner knew from penelon s recital of the captain s brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him				172.93964442507573
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed				4901.064187307886
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions				8053.078341709842
come said d artagnan all this leads to nothing				464.7304488791322
are we to pass the night in the king s room asked d artagnan				1.5417874883491849
if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abbé busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth				1990.6987710508226
but said d artagnan shall we not pursue that woman later said athos				14.99572055355681
the table and chair had nothing the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed				3481.1931957825623
now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work look said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to dantès it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen				9431.852834956188
left alone d artagnan read and reread his billet				13880.926052532468
my dear aramis said d artagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them you are mistaken friend d artagnan said aramis always on his guard this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in one syllable verse which i began yonder ah indeed said d artagnan				236.2691313509286
when mazarin ceased speaking he said to porthos in a low tone never tell mazarin that i understand spanish or i am a lost man and you are also all right said porthos				15.824456536673784
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him but men are changed by events there is nothing truer than that said porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine				1635.88317638742
nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief the last month s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles you are the pearl of cashiers cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns				8143.771635013134
he saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance				865503.1422738075
the general depended much on it he even came to force m danglars				298.9535755886237
hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second and if you move i will blow your brains out and he levelled his carbine at dantès who felt the muzzle against his temple				25563.138942123413
d artagnan obeyed like a child without the least resistance or objection which proved that he was really in love				650.817047074032
she is a foreigner a stranger				3020.6619571696187
when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder a murder do you call it				155.02113439931887
milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will				2224.197405648204
here it is answered the other				414.72297980904784
i am inclined to think so and do you like him why he pleases me in spite of franz d épinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world the countess shuddered				2343.96832960102
i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent				113692.04392352454
why this evening said the abbess today even				41597.034147225175
where your life was spared for shame				4138.097770881935
for a mind so perspicuous as that of d artagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future				1782.9938618535366
on hearing the password germain bowed				2070.198589098649
at length the long desired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him				20.31336626636558
halloo he cried are the prisoners still there yes sir answered the sergeant uncovering				323769.16990183556
do not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over				1873.012012337915
the lackeys were brought by the cries she made				4548.306055333573
i see it in the depths of the inner cavern				13076.286517614708
then believe me it will be time to act yes we will wait				3748.291460702325
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world				913.4366384830874
franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion				1898.9004819858985
the door was opened to the coadjutor of the room in which the mendicant was suffering				5013.663961707107
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers				19655.85098343157
as for that benedetto who so grossly belied his name have you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him no far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast				47631.826790491876
i repeat it d artagnan you are the best one among us i bless and love you my dear son and to think that i couldn t find that out said porthos scratching his head it is so simple but said aramis if i understand rightly we are to kill them all eh athos shuddered and turned pale				693.2227099630179
he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in m morrel s salon				3128.6444371084613
raoul has no fortune other than i possess poor child				1224.5598846031578
eugénie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her turn				1652.169246846944
so d artagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply				969.3003439055923
he had made some difficulties about going under pretext that he still suffered from his wound but d artagnan had said to him remain if you like my dear monsieur mouston but i warn you that paris will be burnt down to night upon which mousqueton had declared without asking anything further that he was ready to follow his master and monsieur d artagnan to the end of the world				829.8407747667915
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles				1553754.1269749834
but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste i must go to paris ah really to paris				266.6448099196458
why about ten or eleven o clock shall we watch by the corpse of what use would it be				1672.2663504765758
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn				1501.7048780861276
my story will be accepted for there is no one left to contradict me as he spoke dantès looked toward the spot where the fishing vessel had been wrecked and started				2339.207336082412
but as i can not and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier s gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance				8616.085208889366
a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man s shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size				19770.964100073263
she went to the palais replied the steward				4646.540177672696
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg™ electronic works				2212.9656828417214
now whenever the king halted the musketeers halted				213806.60029269045
the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment				803.2587041529006
what has happened all sorts of misfortunes what in the first place monsieur athos is arrested arrested				26056.017952424405
the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champ de mars and satory				123825.22768005518
happy on the contrary for what am i in want of				2339.385810247148
you will have the more time to learn to draw it only when it ought to be used sir replied raoul putting the sword to his lips as he received it from the count i owe you everything and yet this sword is the most precious gift you have yet made me				83.82769059391319
yes noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything				2967.525962150372
the more this young man was superior to others the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him				24.164388945853485
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one				431.5232110019657
here you decide then nothing about me my lord on the contrary i have come to a decision bernouin came into the room				354.7492931638874
it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists otherwise all the world would be poisoning each other by chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry said monte cristo carelessly				12483.645200105711
milady faltered d artagnan and fainted a second time				549.3861977838627
who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen				4031.5169666011743
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine o clock in the morning to take a third letter				668.7451473197565
yes it is one of milady s bastards you laugh aramis from habit that is all				792.9088675549203
on their side the three musketeers were much attached to their young comrade				7716.8341694423725
d artagnan in his fortieth year				2570.9867643672123
your address at paris hôtel of the guards company of dessessart enough replied the questioner				684534.8443735729
what ails our friend said aramis he resembles one of dante s damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels				1461915.5299401258
if m danglars will not fight with me i will kill his son in law cavalcanti will certainly fight the servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted				5905.02768915995
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible monsieur de comminges said athos i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me i will do it with all my heart said comminges for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty i know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested				5704.924595029738
why they want to know if the duke of buckingham is in paris and if he has had or is likely to have an interview with the queen d artagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in probability				390051.4482197319
and i who have sworn to take him dead or alive i am dishonored and by you kill me replied athos uncovering his breast if your honor requires my death oh				659.4687417398974
but all this will come to an end tréville will come to an end				1528.2814779925457
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo				25.31396308161239
dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot until this manœuvre was completed and then he added half mast the colors and square the yards you see said danglars he fancies himself captain already upon my word and so in fact he is said the owner				10183.773619451887
30145m oh very simply black trousers patent leather boots white waistcoat either a black or blue coat and a long cravat				155809.50639059758
i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet				1690.718747427339
monsieur porthos said she i can assure you that you have severely punished me and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a similar situation you have but to apply to me fie madame fie said porthos as if disgusted				250386.1061210567
heigh sir said d artagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouse evading women				2347.7323794884046
the king don carlos has not left bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace				8210.564174322548
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full speed				3029.804792087834
the moment that d artagnan saw that his wish was accomplished and his man would not escape him he recovered his usual tranquillity				38744.38552643371

send him away and all will then be well what do you wish me to do oh madame				733.7835906205412
my poor friend resumed d artagnan not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead i faith said rochefort there s no great difference i think between a dead man and one who has been buried alive now i have been buried alive or very nearly so and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile do you wish me to speak the truth yes well then i don t know have you any suspicion of me rochefort no				952.5488100095922

richelieu counted on his fingers and said to himself she will arrive she says four or five days after having received the money				819.7228171006856
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our service then said tréville it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there the king looked at the cardinal				414.0290443125986
do you know the count of monte cristo you mean monsieur zaccone i presume zaccone is not his name monte cristo monte cristo is the name of an estate or rather of a rock and not a family name well be it so let us not dispute about words and since m de monte cristo and m zaccone are the same absolutely the same let us speak of m zaccone agreed i asked you if you knew him extremely well who is he the son of a rich shipbuilder in malta i know that is the report but as you are aware the police does not content itself with vague reports however replied the abbé with an affable smile when that report is in accordance with the truth everybody must believe it the police as well as all the rest are you sure of what you assert what do you mean by that question understand sir i do not in the least suspect your veracity i ask if you are certain of it i knew his father m zaccone ah indeed and when a child i often played with the son in the timber yards but whence does he derive the title of count you are aware that may be bought in italy everywhere and his immense riches whence does he procure them they may not be so very great how much do you suppose he possesses from one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four millions two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital but i was told he had four millions per annum that is not probable do you know this island of monte cristo certainly everyone who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by sea must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it i am told it is a delightful place it is a rock and why has the count bought a rock for the sake of being a count				563.3832114161662
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands				323.6464259055913
i feel cramps over my whole body do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes yes any noise in the ears frightful 40112m when did you first feel that just now suddenly yes like a clap of thunder did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before nothing no drowsiness none what have you eaten today i have eaten nothing i only drank a glass of my master s lemonade that s all and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him				178.72941813004775
all the events we have described had taken place within a half hour				1157.0753565037326
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands				278.37568232945716
only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us				482.71949535015796
well yes you are right that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly				23403.889400272867
he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present				2581.8100315911565
the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious and then that which was inconceivable in athos who was always retiring was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society those manners of a high degree which appeared as if unconsciously to himself in his least actions				6162.044274000446
but this sufficed for jacopo who instinctively felt that edmond had a right to superiority of position a superiority which edmond had concealed from all others				1547.9880023673318
franz and the count got into the carriage				1151.677657432355
there are four men come to arrest me				38.62114833182386
he will never see you again all is over				1813.040248238123
i have heard speak of a mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question				1492.81694513967
persons whom i do not like yes indeed				678.0857520784687
the abbé took it and in return gave caderousse the diamond				1693.9143057149458
don t forget the signal jesus seigneur and he went out as he came in whistling the self same air				1381.0711354311372
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window				1197.4901830832753
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain				2050.5563244906066
meanwhile sir watch always watch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here				585.4737008737062
a terrible howling interrupted these reflections of d artagnan and mme				492.19357753527106
there was only this blow wanting then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile				1102063.5457255547
i had designedly taken this direction				12601.176813186388
absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance but his father a sun pluribus impar left his personal splendor to each of his favorites his individual value to each of his courtiers				16585.605737666592
the fair worshipper touched the great hand of porthos with her delicate fingers smiled made the sign of the cross and left the church				2336.193181350736
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors				74424.52033858455
it is woman who has ruined us still ruins us and will ruin us as long as the world stands				4571.859286418993
porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn d artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye				1350.3645645791112
the nails too were turning blue				46509.58201817156
the next minute franz heard himself called by albert who made the lofty building re echo with the sound of his friend s name				667.8824891744224
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand				404.3081110742291
now said athos that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the king s entrance they had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the king s arrival				17620.214322140164
the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques				11759.48634794102
on your knees count athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula i make you a knight				408531.1201454772
hoarse shouts were heard from the excited mob				62051.9676542434
the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening				673.761072985338
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation				33651.498506160686
the three friends looked on panting and astonished				1933.4687741327634
dantès was about to speak but feeling himself urged forward and having neither the power nor the intention to resist he mounted the steps and was in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes the two others took their places opposite and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones				6397.254489454363
this portrait attracted the count of monte cristo s attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it				37.83163172291341
or richelieu for two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence				3907.878981328141
so at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting				9019.957492953512
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides				48300.45714623755
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused				6773.312032014731
happy beyond measure well i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health d artagnan almost leaped with joy				547.1175387053788
he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante				162869.22513211513
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg of you monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m villefort entered				688.9709898045205
it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary				133260.89295127118
has he not seen monsieur d artagnan at my house oh yes yes you are right				1060.5851884985252
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own ears i also said aramis				18.44240413995092
edward endured the accident with miraculous courage he did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over				1863.9900603121614
beauchamp took the paper and read the article to which albert pointed in an undertone				5197.138062340736
to give ten francs to this honest fellow replied raoul taking a pistole from his pocket				781.553412020683
from lord de winter repeated buckingham let him come in felton entered				661.6070645262721
athos and aramis looked at him inquiringly				9288.707722776931
well happily i don t say nay to it				29.357206690022778
during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed madame de villefort had gone to visit m noirtier				1362.7108592569587
d artagnan and his friends are detained at the siege of la rochelle how do you know that my brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of musketeers				966.4910211272146
but à propos resumed m de tréville what has become of your three companions i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them none monsieur well i left them on my road porthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining see there now said m de tréville and how the devil did you escape by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry there again				508.69747343515036
as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerf s antechamber a footman the same who at rome had brought the count s card to the two young men and announced his visit sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him				12.640802123083017
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law				1000.453670941309
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking				156902.79732471742
count what am i bound to do being in possession of this secret my dear friend said monte cristo you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by heart				233.51328348575402
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean it means that i have just returned from yanina from yanina yes impossible here is my passport examine the visa geneva milan venice trieste delvino yanina				4671.550958504931
however difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished him				19.00464744811202
instead of performing your part of this contract as i performed mine you bought me from the scotch cheaply i know and that does honor to the economic talent of your government				28963.848009746223
what do you want with me said she				273.53202932647486
the mercer had said that he was rich the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as m bonacieux and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of love which had been the consequence of it				203.87008409520482
la ramee la ramee came into the room				442.46672544786423
there can be no doubt about it thought he it is some prisoner who is striving to obtain his freedom				18145.79813939983
well said albert in a determined tone you see that your paper has insulted a member of my family and i insist on a retractation being made you insist yes i insist permit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber my dear viscount nor do i wish to be there replied the young man rising				8563.771297188596
yesterday i was at the house of a doctor of theology whom i sometimes consult about my studies athos smiled				1032.6279619848367
here is what i am looking for thought d artagnan but alas				4003.7348227449183
you are right sir said raoul				277.8749075501521
mother nanette cried friquet suffocating ah				301.1747664801024
come this is no longer our home the words died away the steps were lost in the distance				3200.316107662963
yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent i might have prevented benedetto from killing you but i found you proud and blood thirsty and i left you in the hands of god i do not believe there is a god howled caderousse you do not believe it you lie you lie silence said the abbé you will force the last drop of blood from your veins				5377.522183891196
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars				120.84675304415815
yes especially if you will show me the poor abbé s room ah				411.5764290664824
but continued she lord wilmore had a family or friends he must have known someone can we not oh it is useless to inquire returned the count perhaps after all he was not the man you seek for				1453.0190484071886
jacopo will carry you to leghorn where monsieur noirtier awaits his granddaughter whom he wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar				32417.714761371783
to be named the just you are right tréville but they were not alone your musketeers				810.2206621677923
50211m madame said the count it is no longer in my power to restore you to happiness but i offer you consolation will you deign to accept it as coming from a friend i am indeed most wretched replied mercédès				1142.5790166462534
what do you say that my orders go far madame and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty what horror cried the queen				251.32927098400964
on landing the count turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding morrel				306.39568580086046
this something was enveloped in a cloak and d artagnan at first believed it was a man but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a woman				762.0208597857608
if his eminence said he did not have personal motives the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him pardon me said he but the instant your majesty considers me a prejudiced judge i withdraw come said the king will you swear by my father that athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it by your glorious father and by yourself whom i love and venerate above all the world i swear it be so kind as to reflect sire said the cardinal				551.3108326682668
yesterday i undertook to employ that cord which you see hanging against the wall but pain prevented my continuing the pious exercise that s the first time i ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot wounds with cat o nine tails but you were ill and illness renders the head weak therefore you may be excused when do you mean to set out tomorrow at daybreak				80269.5142574309
she slept as a prisoner sleeps rocked by his first hope				2165.3193253143404
i will allow myself to die with hunger come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as that				909.0012401109859
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire				4947.060701561616
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead asked d artagnan				1.4816429616559244
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion				219059.80794162446
you may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests me				378.6734098064888
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade				3497.845801251196
you morcerf replied the secretary resting on the stairs				964.5835677285917
this execution quieted the ill disposed who resolved to allow themselves to die of hunger this death always appearing to them more slow and less sure than strangulation				154944.29169069554
athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes				623.1541681738158
take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have more gently gently said the old man with a smile and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them do as you please but first of all pray have a servant father				833.3918348205304
i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army is not that the duc de chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers good day sirs said the duke advancing you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything				404.7114341831376
ah he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that mousqueton was thirsty he made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare				179506.5807551712
yes but it was fated that i should not keep it so then we are all right as regards the executioner said athos but unfortunately every executioner has his assistant his man or whatever you call him and this one had his said d artagnan but as good luck would have it just as i thought i should have two affairs to manage our friend was brought home with a broken leg				34047.52231070408
have you been satisfied with him this voyage that is according to the sense you attach to the question sir				385.15476069164396

the boat followed in the wake of the ship a speck near the enormous mass				12329.102316671715
why should you expose your game to your adversary				2333.2441014277147
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee valentine it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of morrel were stifled in his throat his breast heaved the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eyes and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed				1684.4661827806483
seek not to console me alas nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow the wound is too deep and too fresh				43379.24076848582
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale				9221.275487954957
either you are a demon continued felton or the baron my benefactor my father is a monster				9098.854945020403
well but can t you speak come monsieur porthos rose saluted his friends and followed mousqueton				697.4920205848749
what cried aramis and athos what				1153.6733944075795
oh returned she it was a gift of heaven				1111.738161972129
we will cross switzerland and go down into italy by the saint gothard				117561.28394812123
my place of abode is no				888.0526473113874
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else				2294.9060603121966
what are you doing asked the coadjutor				4239.014395020171
bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her she was like people who dream they are pursued and who in vain try to walk				7284.118364696685
i understand why you accepted it and i grant you my pardon but upon one condition what is that said the soldier uneasy at perceiving that all was not over				1739.4209085470131
what shall i say to the cardinal you can tell him sir answered a voice which was the voice of high command in the battle field that he sent against me the only two men capable of getting the better of four men of fighting man to man without discomfiture against the comte de la fere and the chevalier d herblay and of surrendering only to fifty men				764.6955110308472
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a man s head inside the carriage				1235.1562399726579
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o clock				1605.1337602740625
he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared but at two o clock she had not returned				1112.4964893199106
i have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head that i am become passive in the hands of the almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an eagle				180170.6569317416
i pardon you for the death of poor felton i pardon you for the attempts upon my own person				1410.9734581239165
that i might the sooner see you again my dear father replied the young man				111.59733344075687
i want to know the route i am to follow said d artagnan				2.129866092053658
the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example				2238.198521852682
all noise in the streets had ceased and the silence was frightful				6516.527120570764
bring her in said the president				2325.7850917082624
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century the invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days as soon as societies in forming had invented any kind of police that police invented mousetraps				641649.5501861194
a week before his return lord de winter died leaving me his sole heir				4936.405056467383
but this last circumstance was not striking as the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much				1828.2196583752018
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice				4422.06250344079
that french officer yes fernand yes the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand				480.7774824631734
if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping the abbé smiled				1241.5246253503722
as for me answered porthos i wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates peers you know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs my friends will submit them				185.05631971781776
you will of course dispose of it in some way or other yes in favor of some member of your family no do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes then pursued the notary				2464.3111307542704
the opinion of athos was that d artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish				182981.9288158137
it is easy to suppose that morrel s agitation would not escape the count s penetrating eye				1501.7177673777999
for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercédès my betrothed 40268m the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry edmond dantès then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligible home home the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived				15618.149787039076
bazin uttered a profound sigh and went out to look for the ladder				1674.8862606638797
as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard				1272.1173257065436
it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease m de morcerf whose portrait by gros i will also show you				275.7149658040267
if they kill you english justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble				7971.996655811554
this anxiety became so great that it even extended to aramis and porthos				396.71823741861516
and you fellows resumed mousqueton stay near monsieur le comte d artagnan and pay him every attention in your power whilst i go to prepare my lord for his visit and mounting his horse mousqueton rode off down the avenue on the grass at a hand gallop				2093.392256948583
gentlemen replied d artagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence				1414.8217562649481
the villa of san felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the lovely carmela				12909.875411500607
he was for some time without reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of nature specially after a fantastic dream then gradually this view of the outer world so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory				4357.338601065144
what was most pressing was to get mme				298.3272880625857
the commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone else				2280.542596300276
the soubrette said for your master i have no other master but you so a pretty little lass my faith is that soubrette d artagnan opened the letter and read these words a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest				2807.8024594789294
milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible duel in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did animosity				1989282.2521824085
fernand understood nothing except that dantès was absent				11657.50706897404
gentlemen and citizens set me free i shall go to the louvre and strangle mazarin				207.38532039571595
but your wife monsieur what has she to do with all this her devotion to the queen is known and they wish either to remove her from her mistress or to intimidate her in order to obtain her majesty s secrets or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy that is likely said d artagnan but the man who has abducted her do you know him i have told you that i believe i know him his name i do not know that what i do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil genius but you have seen him yes my wife pointed him out to me one day has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him oh certainly he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his temple a scar on his temple cried d artagnan and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriage why that s my man of meung he is your man do you say yes yes but that has nothing to do with it				39.72021327053416
then caderousse feeling that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying voice cried with great effort murder				16027.544565087825
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercédès has declared she will kill herself if dantès is killed caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès				160.041362999042
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to d artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel				3770.4731919005917
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door				295.3883918198985
go on signor pastrini continued franz smiling at his friend s susceptibility				402251.1349245837
oh yes replied the count understand me i would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow and the more so that thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my man				254.27124824762063
dantès meanwhile went on his way				616.1435880624604
instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched				152340.6072775411
but is it the custom for the officers in the english navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of great britain and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore yes madame it is the custom not from gallantry but prudence that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular hôtels in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness				3201.43335633165
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger				2436.63024103039
bonacieux you speak that in a tone that frightens me mme				266.8922239021323
oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow love and gratitude fill the heart ennui can find no place you are a worthy daughter of epirus haydée and your charming and poetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your country as their birthplace				144385.95103989905
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg™ license when you share it without charge with others				1028.3402463972059
the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter				23021.058376124434
can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos				14.813670572165528
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown				154894.50241804583
of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful				18218.60828311862
what would you have my dear viscount said monte cristo wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other				733.4848408820417
yes grandpapa said valentine it is so				602.2846252883311
do you think they will grant it without doubt how many are they four and the two bandits make six just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last time steer to monte cristo yes but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions by all means be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses i do more than permit i exhort you silence then said gaetano				4340.487546195807
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion baptistin entered and remained standing at the door				295.2208252940798
at the end of a quarter of an hour vampa quitted the grotto his costume was no less elegant than that of teresa				4429.212226556478
happiness comes to meet him does it not monsieur bonacieux bonacieux became as pale as death and grinned a ghastly smile				793.8504882798538
how pale you look it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame de villefort m				737.0153213101091
but what are you about there				364.7074536191725
on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment				26344.08227474174
among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words behold the misery of the people wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions				102571.4409170177
there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose				2044.9720101370592
so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our daughter i philosophically closed my eyes but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin i will not be the foundation of another man s fortune				1345.9212265384235
monsieur she said i i do not understand you and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions				214500.7872354828
i have given you the choice between america and tyburn replied lord de winter				366.8066050021779
he did not wait long for in five minutes the queen entered in full gala costume				4150.096395641124
young man said he to d artagnan a suggestion what you may get into trouble by what has taken place you believe so yes				801.3344040866231
but this confession concerns me only				14929.629252811756
now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and chambertin wine instead of macon				120043.79982803292
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man				231.75894108234215
30297m at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need				18396.76433176958
nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart				260.7233473195708
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits				121083.65922817233
a strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a hope				2109.6902150148185
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity				1360.8413939760444
0111m the boat continued her voyage				13960.554398217715
yours is a noble nature he said here is your sword raoul bent his knee to the ground				1127.6210306252117
now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail i am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket contained				14679.591660182547
have they then offered a large one inquired cromwell				5913.125663799032
three days since you were with him in normandy only three days since we looked on him as our best friend an ironical smile passed over albert s lips				575.7380650808412
d artagnan overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk				8935.947343623118
gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one				676.1965469584476
ah ah said bonacieux you are a jocular companion				2129.108920859689
they were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant island of la pianosa				170386.55787875183
among these two hundred levees that of tréville was one of the most sought				4102.090554814679
now grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed				870.8180189411385
i am at your service sir said the abbé with a marked italian accent				4798.400821156173
i know who it is then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said i wish you joy my lord impudent fellow cried d artagnan you will get me turned off the gate groaned on its hinges and d artagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal				579.3318947927451
one minute that knife one minute a single minute and i will restore it to you through the grating of the door				300.10146555393453
did he speak in your hearing				201915.5424167423
then wretched creature then you tempted god a third time				471.2815043663355
they don t have lieutenants in a felucca manned by a crew of four yes but monsieur groslow is not a captain of the ordinary kind he has a lieutenant and that lieutenant is monsieur mordaunt this time the musketeers did more than shudder they almost cried out				563.3805250020761
planchet art thou there cried mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears				1504.234729119366
and then he was older than any of us added d artagnan				2.211034330108527
cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet d artagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme				445.15266115240837
those who love me follow me and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe free				4407.423557430313
suppose he said we roughly chalk out a career for this young man				110.44965463917403
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid				128473.42151176196
then he had eaten some without saying a word more danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga				156368.0204281667
one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue férou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abbé busoni were within				9829.683000147565
he guessed likewise by induction that porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of chantilly when the procurator s wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse				2687.057714120085
why did you not say so at once my dear sir				391.93426385067517
he now wished to be amongst them in order to see some other face besides that of his jailer he sighed for the galleys with the infamous costume the chain and the brand on the shoulder				1039.3026880167808
signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear when villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said d épinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club that i may at least know who killed my father villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather s answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few steps				4931.107005818478
now athos said d artagnan do you begin to believe that it s a ruined cause and that what with your harrisons joyces bridges and cromwells we shall never get the upper hand the king will be delivered at the tribunal said athos the very silence of his supporters indicates that they are at work d artagnan shrugged his shoulders				929.0784953263134
rest assured gentlemen that within three days in a less time than justice would demand the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth and grasped the old man s senseless hand				471.251841661478
30171m yes i do want a notary motioned the old man shutting his eyes with a look of defiance which seemed to say and i should like to see the person who dares to refuse my request you shall have a notary as you absolutely wish for one sir said villefort but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the scene can not fail of being a most ridiculous one never mind that said barrois i shall go and fetch a notary nevertheless and the old servant departed triumphantly on his mission				3085.454791406252
in fact he could say these two children of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which i alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the english people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say a throne				831747.1439335006
life for life man for man give me one i will give you the other i don t know what you mean nor do i even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal but i wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creature the more so as you tell me this d artagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal				332.0344483934097
she looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy				570.1671837513915
who was it you were talking with over there she asked				1385.7540752979983
there to his great astonishment d artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into				191974.02520075982
let us see said d artagnan				1.508891603390379
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me alas continued athos the poor abbé was not a st ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature monsieur cried the duchess seizing athos s hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you athos laughed				8636.38849899642
ah said beauchamp you doubt me				77.58881370793267
noirtier watched the expression of each one and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude				174677.02384970945
that man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution				34191.898043286215
you know dear d artagnan i am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman				1655.481388271171
at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all albert s establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count s chasseur also				1433.8000444032432
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five o clock our little cabin boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom house officers advancing in our direction				3960.223372437418
this being understood let us proceed with our history				5273.229861186091
his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert s grief stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men				477.84310021055546
i will go with you and he took his sword and cloak				1791.6793130362837
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent				1411.1571457282876
besides porthos can not owe you much how not much				1661.8838899936852
i have seen them before as ugly no but reasonably hideous what a misfortune for the wounded man to die under the hands of such a friar pshaw said de guiche				3514.3501534957713
