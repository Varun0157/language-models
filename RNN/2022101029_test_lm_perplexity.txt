ah is that you d artagnan and you athos said the young man				179.06201882156623
but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy				1960.2265166113775
de tréville knows him and esteems him very highly and de tréville as you know is one of the queen s greatest friends				429.70581131859086
you asked me just now if i was in funds said d artagnan placing some twenty pistoles upon the table				750.206463656476
i think i understand his reason said morrel				434.6066777370397
are there any magistrates or judges at the château d if there are only said the gendarme a governor a garrison turnkeys and good thick walls				8574.468639662538
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the 4 500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs élysées				10496.855595172183
you should have allowed me to sleep				1403.5290720578769
it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth still argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it				88.82656430743515
sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead				236450.7220855167
monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me you have then seen something replied d artagnan				80.11395280931234
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured villefort				302.98523714578164
and if i refuse to retract you wish to fight do you said beauchamp in a calm tone				778.5431757536024
i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine looking fellow admirably dressed				198158.62397261162
it is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me				126.06031979572856
perhaps by the time you return to paris i shall be quite a sober staid father of a family				1594.9422075745156
one night twenty years ago my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you to armentieres i know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms just so where do you come from now i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse				507.53787692619136
i am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force				3122.2509253949993
he was told that twenty citizens headed by one man had attacked a carriage which was escorted by a troop of the cardinal s bodyguard but a reinforcement having come up the assailants had been put to flight and the leader had taken refuge in the hotel next to his lodgings the house was now being searched				177616.72373183438
leave the saucepan said dantès you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast this advice was to the jailer s taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip				55269.53812618366
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinal s hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin				778.4715300555298
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect				47896.20595159578
at a hundred paces from the gates of calais d artagnan s horse gave out and could not by any means be made to get up again the blood flowing from his eyes and his nose				185541.50773990847
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at half past two o clock the mayor of marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall				12310.116106282243
the only way of doing that was to cause the disappearance of the london executioner				1704.0840372944178
the king was closeted with the cardinal and m de tréville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment				574.1003368741538
i must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands yes yes madame you must and i will save them all but how				2888.494180731559
i was a witness of the last hours of charles i				668.19338939385
you told me my dear valentine that you were engaged to m d épinay and that your father was resolved upon completing the match and that from his will there was no appeal as m de villefort was never known to change a determination once formed				7184.687731688398
i embrace you with all my heart				361.31305055513315
i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to you				95.70748064015403
go on said the abbé it seems as if i were listening to the story of a dream				1101.502869005472
a very respectable lady said aramis				152.92123152484794
is it not tempting what i offer you and is it not an easy thing since it is only to do thus				1454.5108343527595
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it you don t mention those who aided and abetted the deed said caderousse				528.7513602412596
still he had not even uttered a sigh				1081.609080853722
he fancied in the darkness that he recognized the young man who had questioned him				50.34425522145273
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together				1575.9261641937494
but if it is a woman who writes said aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her d artagnan which is not the part of a gentleman we will remain in the background said porthos and he will advance alone yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop bah said d artagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in it				88.82652195163874
m de villefort a true parisian considered the cemetery of père lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian family there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates				113035.58872215211
athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was				868.5198057894631

he fell down this morning and broke his leg				35305.40217724131
they have selected a field of battle on which i am an abler general than they that of a conference				16063.198347083453
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied me				126.05719410175836
what is he doing up there and they called château renaud s attention to him				50.344015161909155
i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead your son shall be happy mercédès repeated the count				288.848031499041
i thought as much said d artagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts				12220.70305882947
i believed you dead why did i survive you				95.77810694443731
in a moment he was on the ground				1793.2981625229195
as usual valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them				157.72394616053865
m de tréville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair				1232.2125554913791
and you will tell him i will publish the report of bois robert and the marquis de beautru upon the interview which the duke had at the residence of madame the constable with the queen on the evening madame the constable gave a masquerade				170816.5693360921
well has anybody come out no but somebody has gone in a man or a woman a man ah				256.51296832557233
come speak avow freely that you accuse him no sire but i say that he deceives himself				264.23679342002333
suddenly edmond saw the gloomy pale and threatening countenance of fernand as it was defined in the shadow				4061.536523774943
what are you doing reverend sir				540.171052243743
unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn you love valentine that daughter of an accursed race never had morrel witnessed such an expression never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face never had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous nights of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire				2491.3464222275506
but are you well assured sir lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all and when is this to be consummated to day this morning so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose to do what				670.0151853918264
the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of opulence				217946.22381472334
i alone can save you and i will valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage and began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent words she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress				217947.4709165874
that will teach me he said to have my guards provided with better horses for if they had been able to keep up with you and if each one of them had done as much as you and your friend you would have kept your word and would have brought him back to me dead or alive well there s nothing bad in that it seems to me said porthos				145.03864679248733
yes i am a man of honor said d artagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess it for i do possess it do i not entirely go on well i feel as if transformed a confession weighs on my mind a confession if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not without doubt then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me perhaps d artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to milady s but she evaded him				50.3382780794138
have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met				7382.038053290874
no said she i do not remember it just at this moment but if it should occur to me presently i will tell you albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name when monte cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach the young man recollected his promise and was silent				1866.0399160760833
m de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court				908.0789027477666
as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his maneuvers oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis				151.4695763351021
the term for which edmond had engaged to serve on board la jeune amélie having expired dantès took leave of the captain who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further				5908.525869809562
for one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect he threw himself on his father s neck				8834.679309553047
for master broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people				1043.3534882593858
i scarcely thought you were so curious as that i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies and he was not among the least of them				157.70582192013455
they would have carried him to greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold				6630.627266429854
no replied the soldier tenacious in his credulity he has foretold many things which have come to pass for instance that the queen would have a son that monsieur coligny would be killed in a duel with the duc de guise and finally that the coadjutor would be made cardinal				410.1122303483416
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength				1717.5451531279173
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both				5663.687406589187
his desire for revenge had not forsaken him				50.45633182438273
i am the queen do you recognize me no madame replied d artagnan				80.12640740424023
positively these four men must be on my side the same evening the cardinal spoke to m de tréville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp				2462.469301607394
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink valentine shuddered				2428.1667658162223
we must understand each other said the duke				666.4470918481398
but suggested d artagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so well at chantilly porthos yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably here				688.995958306576
my lord asks of what country you are said the young man in the purest castilian				177488.20437383637
but whether this was reality or vision he had this time sufficient self command not to enter				2363.0068634504405
but this war may bring round a peace this peace will require a negotiator that negotiator will be me				126.06031979572856
she spoke some words to lord de winter in english who thereupon requested d artagnan s permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his pardon				41358.983712559326
milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half				9912.91170545046
i shall ask him just the very way not to know				1128.8503255305702
the two guards led the prisoner toward the table and upon a sign from the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything				1876.7937298557385
and it was no bad one i believe since here we are i do not say replied andrea that you never make a good one but let us see your plan well pursued caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs				741.7262047910266
i know nothing about it you don t know i quit the seminary not at all this is my story then				889.0224684154527
the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of the little versailles				58298.15524412533
he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hour no change took place				1078.9469590895715
it was dark and silent as the tomb				6305.340070188729
that s what i wanted to know				1129.9554120964958
i am not obliged to read any breviary				27672.67968409778
the ballet of la merlaison on the morrow nothing was talked of in paris but the ball which the aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen and in which their majesties were to dance the famous la merlaison the favorite ballet of the king				424.998600706985
what shall i do now nothing it is finished then no not yet i should like to understand said porthos				145.042173986
valentine instinctively raised her eyes as if to thank heaven				741.7566221196456
should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the abbé busoni send for me if i am still on earth and i will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity bertuccio bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily				20713.351740867733
he drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her eyes				492.3642312408232
d artagnan did not know where he was and wished himself a hundred feet underground				217925.43983419554
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him d avrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it				88.82652195163874
have you seen him lately he sent for me to day really				6830.258331867384
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara				217947.4709165874
the procurator s wife took porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation				198955.2547589243
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars				455.0978658051595
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away				594.868276104375
the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for and by successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort l evêque				191521.9827676711
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brows				25370.03528159131
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil 27 rue du helder on the 21 st may half past ten a m chapter 39				217947.4709165874
debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife				992.2128290630017
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette				202108.58142454116
ah sir said caderousse with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich man but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being honest the abbé fixed on him a searching penetrating glance				7057.640002334524
all eyes were fixed on the door which opened slowly and with a kind of solemnity				7510.254121303351
monsieur the cardinal cried the stupefied musketeer				998.370641693144
and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugénie yesterday				7296.222574474308
monsieur d artagnan cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy monsieur d artagnan				80.11605390889143
the peasant the gardener was rochefort whom he believed to be in the bastile				15606.446995862188
well cried his auditors at the moment you left his house aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort like a man who in the full relation of a falsehood finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him their ears were wide open and there were no means of retreat				3524.3217149902584
what is he himself asked madame henrietta				20980.51142462772
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards				30725.686296652493
i am the bearer of a letter that is all				335.77171935131906
ah sir said d artagnan you have a wicked smile				397.65289063113966
andrea was supported by two priests				32065.500005719692
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away that was true ah				256.5080757756371
he then turned to the left down a corridor which had escaped the attention of the two friends but as he opened the door he paused as if in thought				1955.942760003634
the steps were already down and the door open				1289.7649002123144
perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends i hope yes my lord but with the hope of soon becoming enemies be satisfied i promise you that i depend upon your word my lord d artagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside				156508.25999301468
i would then rather die truly murmured valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not				591.6501496848681
instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper s reign officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condé and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god				569.4482511130736
the two friends looked to the right to the left they were encompassed by a troop of horsemen				6422.623381990825
the part of an honest man full of courage and real regard				160286.8385485755
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend d artagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal what				670.0151853918264
to the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silence unbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above				34252.56996057798
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man s eyes				492.3689268144299
ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it mean the pharaon come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study				2366.3704083969474
nobody knows who she is or where she comes from				32490.72756677227
i fancy i begin to see my way murmured milady with a savage joy burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be watching her this burst of inward satisfaction				6181.744623026367
indeed my dear sir said monte cristo you are revoltingly foppish i foppish				217855.20465021252
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brother s pay alone kept her				164.27416187265285
all this is perhaps folly perhaps insanity but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love what queen a servant more ardent my lord my lord you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly				156783.28516356694
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune oh that depends upon circumstances				4879.168722982973

his noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them				157.72379574333382
adieu my charmer i will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better humor at these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and disappeared				585.3338505956872
we discoursed a long time madame on different subjects of perugino of raphael of manners customs of the famous aqua tofana of which they had told you i think you said that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the secret yes true replied madame de villefort somewhat uneasily i remember now i do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed madame continued the count with perfect calmness but i perfectly remember that falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of mademoiselle de villefort yes really sir you were in fact a medical man said madame de villefort since you had cured the sick molière or beaumarchais would reply to you madame that it was precisely because i was not that i had cured my patients for myself i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand at this moment the clock struck six				4816.556484492435
i do not feel remorse because that woman i profoundly hold deserved her punishment				4620.0283846922275
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one blood washes out shame poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much she is so noble a woman pity albert also maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess				1964.0775561112184
as d artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m de tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private audience				4262.213670726977
death is depicted on his face				675.684390780141

he appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort				22523.08251410499
what is his name you know him indeed yes it is surely not one of my friends replied d artagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant				8725.883441384656

when one puts on a mask it is not difficult to wear a beard under it i am sorry i did not follow him said porthos				145.03961503314548
i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me				126.05719410175836

one day benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree				13536.376687596381
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner				2472.2085121900936
the pale light of the first rays of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression				1763.2997794509427
let us then take advantage of it then aloud well my dear la ramee				1392.4447042128345
if they ask it what have i to say that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again				391.9701481468536
tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with frondeurs nor any interest in the fronde if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality comminges smiled mazarin read and construed that smile				397.4944035188306

the baron appears thoughtful today said monte cristo to her are they going to put him in the ministry not yet i think				9801.114183625052
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity				217938.32566862876
lucien had found time preparatory to the count s arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars				455.1002528947232
and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say soldiers				3864.5762416042753
at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening dantès seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair				213927.34427713187
pooh said porthos it is always that				539.7912647147876
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately				1383.8173650093875
think if i am found out here the people of the house who have not seen me enter it will take me for a thief true said d artagnan				80.11406741332308

as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthos s long cloak and d artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it				88.82758085260778
the young man appeared on the threshold of the minister s closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter				592.0204079496398
and now said la ramee i must ask your highness s pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grimaud s eyes				492.3635269086445

athos listened to his projects then shook his head and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness				42474.7814863029
have i sir comprehended your instructions athos smiled				559.7890117299268
but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o clock in the evening then would come night and with night sleep				1402.5523000742908
this operation proved as great a success as the first				1026.6303451336637
it is i said d artagnan in a subdued voice i the comte de wardes oh my god my god murmured kitty he has not even waited for the hour he himself named well said milady in a trembling voice why do you not enter				2363.0012296097684
latterly i heard his friend monsieur d artagnan give him that name that is it madame that is the same				1670.9766569022395
and now farewell farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror				1755.3427340509545
all he possessed was 15 257 francs				748.025720195111

yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at porthos				145.04085992348945

to lift their hands against a minister of god come here sir said urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other the wounded man smiled sadly				8631.736241915121

he knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at bazin				4661.466515714809
have you gone mad my dear friend what is the matter returned d artagnan we are saved i don t see that at all answered porthos				145.03961503314548

excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m debray lives some distance from here debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do				915.8986898015091
the total amount was found to be as m noirtier had stated				131712.37600385674
i do not suppose you will have the presumption to set it to rights that would be to accuse her majesty queen anne of falsehood with the queen sir replied athos in his calm vibrating voice				412.8276861445323

i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutter yes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to d artagnan i was not speaking to you sir but i am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn				41424.194905066615
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion				3958.577045927626

as a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine				1190.4879108589278
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him				50.3382780794138
the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o clock in the morning				871.0929501459249
let us understand each other my lord replied d artagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake				3995.5492179058733
in the name of heaven explain yourself that i may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables that i may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my persecutor				169799.50832225877
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefort observe that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefort villefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son in law of the marquis and marquise de saint méran				7660.550087771096

beauchamp the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation throughout paris for the next fortnight				25387.53411869158
valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of every day life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body				892.1428883114719
that s what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio				2152.0583405231905

the three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they should proceed any further when all at once a circle of smoke enveloped the giant of stone and a dozen balls came whistling around d artagnan and his companions				1083.6037813171547
you who have arranged your infernal plans and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous				35035.66489135449
but as you are the strongest after all continued d artagnan don t be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked d artagnan with an eloquent look				945.3816666827512
mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers				2725.324256771536
how strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least we shall see				1793.943032287188

the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie				210213.79344232328
questions and answers followed in a nonchalant manner that made dantès indignant for he felt that all the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his own				1169.353280608978
the fact was that emery s son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed				152520.28334163956

suddenly d artagnan touched something warm which moved				6379.008372217098
it was not without foundation that a report of the king s intention to leave paris by night had been circulated				173193.25881582245
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o clock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since and don t you know where he is not at all is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell				12786.342509144011

let me be on my guard and he assumed a look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have envied				185746.34744865104

he thought it would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance so he sent for peppino				4840.501624976122
it is singular said d artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i can not yet remember a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor				26258.800119018022
for tell me where can you find a love like mine a love which neither time nor absence nor despair can extinguish a love which contents itself with a lost ribbon a stray look or a chance word				527.2573456253132

when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place				1078.9366694985995
how my fault yes i offered you escape by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door certainly porthos men like us can t go out from here purely and simply faith said porthos as for me i could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much d artagnan shrugged his shoulders				2126.679827223054

no no answered dantès don t imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner				804.0308676007393

the fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off				1166.7121707489184
at this time athos came up to d artagnan				80.19192139661388
however this time my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a wish like a submissive and devoted daughter a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl to practice obedience well asked danglars				455.0963467546834
who do these three cavaliers appear to you to be what do you think aramis why they are our men you are not mistaken i recognize monsieur de flamarens and i monsieur de chatillon as to the cavalier in the brown cloak it is the cardinal in person how the devil do they venture so near the hotel de bouillon athos smiled but did not reply				1028.482457973505

he then took his hat from his head and threw it on the ground				1793.3306570429017
how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven and very soon they left the inn				2472.6741981930218

and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion but what are we going to do there you know well that we go to breakfast there but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you				95.69693910074358
in the place of the palais royal d artagnan saw a sergeant who was drilling six or seven hundred citizens				179503.84172301734

come he said you have me in a snare gentlemen				1703.0361435569316
the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat				220868.8917468811
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it				88.83630667715501
i have sent for one replied the abbé				798.2944179553772
i have just received my courier from greece said danglars				455.1855453097812
this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of elba				5501.90258272635
he can not pardon her the history of the saraband				211106.59711754657
the love i have for you is very different from the love i had for my father				446.6052226438573
in the name of heaven cried dantès speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me				126.06284445128476
now madame said debray you have a splendid fortune an income of about 60 000 livres a year which is enormous for a woman who can not keep an establishment here for a year at least				2015.8344147865546
they asked him if some time ago he had not received in his house two gentlemen who were pursued by dragoons without answering he went out and brought in the blade of a rapier				185938.8227955996
fie d artagnan d artagnan cried aramis you are killing me well here it is at last said d artagnan as he drew the letter from his pocket				1334.3090876650524
thus the dealer to whom d artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his color				9810.475068935684
why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me				126.15749538652186
monseigneur replied porthos he has gone as a scout on account of some words of our host which made him believe the road was not safe and you what have you done monsieur porthos i have won five pistoles of aramis well now will you return with me we are at your eminence s orders to horse then gentlemen for it is getting late the attendant was at the door holding the cardinal s horse by the bridle				155769.39184379388
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs				3697.693744443915
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage				205392.76811426264
mademoiselle danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor				265802.30031426233
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands				484.0808461351845
you ask what i have against you i tell you				95.74495585615077
is my lord pleased with his escort asked d artagnan				80.16145111206816
the witnesses thought he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his hand to rise				12045.761840080719
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second				3971.2328052800563
the woman who was here the woman with the embroidered handkerchief who told you there was a woman here replied aramis becoming as pale as death				781.2262729903701
are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison no my lord but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted and what was it that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes you believe in sorcerers then you fool i i mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my lord giulio who cares about them as an italian he is superstitious the duke shrugged his shoulders				2126.679827223054
i too would give up that good monsieur broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean did i say dead or alive replied mazarin				778.4715300555298
in the meanwhile as the godfather is a second father we beg the reader to lay to our account and not to that of the comte de la fère the pleasure or the ennui he may experience				188760.87374920613
franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of bracciano s				837.5038281848516
suddenly mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef				168712.22081709947
after which your majesty will i think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair				1143.3294858289403
i suppose you mean continued d artagnan				80.37138393961662
the next day about nine o clock in the morning he landed at st valery				130662.95633764553
confound you and your punctuality said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host				788.1979468897193
he that man what man that cursed man my evil genius whom i have always met with when threatened by some misfortune he who accompanied that horrible woman when i met her for the first time he whom i was seeking when i offended our athos he whom i saw on the very morning madame bonacieux was abducted				55434.07694553805
upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renée it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for don t you see renée the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale i don t know anything about that replied renée but m de villefort you have promised me have you not always to show mercy to those i plead for make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and i will always consult upon our verdicts my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand				1352.442107598152
by a violent effort he rose half out of the water waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors				4077.50292264851
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career				36862.84216681885
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars the other seats were filled by debray who was placed between the two cavalcanti and by château renaud seated between madame de villefort and morrel				434.3296906885961
of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter what was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio s story				2663.199038410527
take your handkerchief whether it belongs to you or another you may perhaps stand in need of it monsieur is a gascon asked aramis				151.47029860004744
i do not know i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells yes sir a rope ladder and tools and have you them yet no sir i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but i have still something left what is it asked the count impatiently				4405.5871213441915
thy god shall teach thee to repent				191395.81347349155
the first object that met the eyes of d artagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions				185952.47732807824
and then must not all be over				1847.3566858544486
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m morrel and then ran on to mercédès				1363.1586389284741
and moreover in taking such a step we should appear to be doubtful of ourselves				3275.943850705587
reverend sir murmured caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blocked reverend sir i don t know believe me i take my oath a pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forced it is tolerably evident caderousse was choking he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape				1432.1157407387893
must i use any password to procure a horse only dismount another will be immediately saddled albert hesitated a moment				574.1047169288329
by the way what said albert seeing that beauchamp hesitated				4784.578031523012
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing				712.5173509583948
the pont du gard inn such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegarde a little nearer to the former than to the latter a small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard				13292.370807424804
is that not true monsieur bonacieux				3008.6645690990717
the authorities had terrified me and you know that an innkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities but once again that gentleman where is he				208.7553847101054
tell your mistress he at length answered that i wish to speak to her and i beg she will wait for me in her own room yes sir then come to dress and shave me directly sir the valet re appeared almost instantly and having shaved his master assisted him to dress entirely in black				85424.29126169755
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect				3137.886669745851
but blaisois ventured to say i have heard you relate monsieur mousqueton that once on a time at chantilly you fed your master and yourself by taking partridges in a snare carp with a line and bottles with a slipnoose perfectly true but there was an airhole in the cellar and the wine was in bottles				4344.330620390022
my lord one last favor what				672.2136678995047
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind d artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice				412.8276861445323
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de soubise and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention				886.0756155873412
what is it said the musketeers				846.9244391641183
caligula or nero those treasure seekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for				1173.8583511323125
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos				145.03926923216844
would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret				1505.6692454514207
as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel				5548.556417387722
it was that of la carconte				4725.968665338028
really said monte cristo lowering his voice you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage mademoiselle danglars is too rich for me replied morcerf and that frightens me bah exclaimed monte cristo that s a fine reason to give				29447.695688980937
the wise unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing				1210.6205970321157
the king s children next arrived the princess charlotte a beautiful fair haired child with tears in her eyes and the duke of gloucester a boy eight or nine years old whose tearless eyes and curling lip revealed a growing pride				3795.094591699702
oh i remember said d artagnan				80.6314493155702
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse				507.53787692619136
don t you think so d artagnan i think so indeed cried he				208.77609054038876
as for you morrel this is the secret of my conduct towards you				95.71304850184187
m bonacieux lived on very quietly wholly ignorant of what had become of his wife and caring very little about it				88.82859740941393
in a moment he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun s genial influence when the cloud has passed				3828.859824566977
these men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none				4341.791656688676
and why asked the old man				180.4160856014313
but nothing escaped the count s notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister s secretary				22272.636038364286
oh oh replied d artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution we must fly said the queen				376.1481715512764
a tent was erected for them near that of the marshal				14084.789331612563
what are you eating there porthos i am dipping a biscuit in a glass of spanish wine do the same you are right				1369.6794327277776

i must have time to file through these bars				28005.098688320148
but it is your own fault				4118.271361052405
you are a simpleton said athos				153.4911282376941
well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions fear nothing there is a watch over you and if your wings like those of icarus melt before the sun we are here to ease your fall he then said something in arabic to ali who made a sign of obedience and withdrew but not to any distance				4772.041865209773
but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger that is well understood and in that case how shall i know where you are you do not want your lackey is he a sure man to the proof give him to me				126.05719410175836
is not a day divided into twenty four hours each hour into sixty minutes and every minute sub divided into sixty seconds				22959.623728282353
or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another what is that break his arm wound him but do not kill him i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i and you that will be another thing i shall be brought home no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings				37455.526129850055
no it has been stolen from you stolen				99554.16867837906
to be sure for monsieur de wardes now there is one said kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur d artagnan go to bed mademoiselle said milady i don t like comments d artagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which milady fastened herself in				1177.64941676568
remember that olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket				1334.337082877488
the palikares who were prostrated at my father s feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke				38298.98935533619
monk or priest it matters not provided only that he has received from holy church the power of absolving in articulo mortis monsieur d arminges said de guiche remain beside this unfortunate man and see that he is removed as gently as possible				849.4238824665638
there were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled				159491.1888752247
the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment				77052.85213105562
i once knew a bragelonne is he still alive no sir he is dead and i believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which i take my name and your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name the comte de la fere madame replied the young man bowing				3229.4331728549178
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will				1730.3360202043898
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont i think ah said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter you wring my heart and who is this cavalier henrietta asked the queen				376.1481715512764
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d artagnan they attracted his admiration				1480.7732131205064
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin				778.5858693304485
and now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy haydée s apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son haydée said morrel what has become of her she departed last night to leave you to wait for me				126.05719410175836
yes replied the man but at what a price listen friend said monte cristo				202.16417683480825
at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic				182819.3622584842
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness				34380.53165165225
what has happened lord ejaculated the young princess falling on her knees have mercy on us sir said chatillon if you bring bad tidings it will be cruel in you to announce them to the queen aramis went so close to chatillon as almost to touch him				50.3382780794138
because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow so do you understand what i mean yes sir				538.6681441696333
m morrel was seated at his right hand danglars at his left while at a sign from edmond the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable				7103.38128603313
in devotedness or rather in fanaticism what his ordinaries had been to henry iii and his scotch guard to louis xi				14082.680618093542
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there revenge for instance observed franz				603.902822896079
old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond				2926.9791683057347
what i can not tell something wonderful an absurdity a miracle of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled with our reason that folly we call hope				1245.452860438058
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist				226155.1690019455
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain				13421.035793791121
three of my best soldiers whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heart three of my best soldiers i say athos porthos and aramis had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning				871.0929501459249
the dappled grays volume three chapter 48				99207.75882850407
the king and his escort were no longer there				485.8480495660652
i remember just at his age how deep in love i was with a grecian statue which our good king then henry iv gave my father insomuch that i was mad with grief when they told me that the story of pygmalion was nothing but a fable it is mere want of occupation				8288.394961972723
oh my mother it was you who said you were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen				376.1494270833481
if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his head if anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three days if anyone had said to either of us then live the day will come when you will be happy and will bless life no matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulity and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you how often have i myself ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine look at me said monte cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive look at me				126.05719410175836
besides this time my visit has a motive milady trembled she thought felton had told all				335.6585417680739
they seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies which means which means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen				156040.14237551918
bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits				212656.84173482156
d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week				4136.294660148365
he had friends then after five years in prison				868.0254603648636
you have done right lieutenant said the soldier				1780.760092456064
0295m it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto				6632.97368476365
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into eugénie became uneasy				4231.566319338568
there is your money the same sum as that you have received already				14735.977866170895
you shall see and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help she screamed my master is being arrested the councillor broussel is being arrested				8040.945388687171
no i hope that when he sees me leave you he will come out that is possible go i am going said albert as he made his parting bow				2315.580156313916
and could you not stop your fatal career if you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it				88.82787734714118
the appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation				13431.932416779298
they were both aroused at seven o clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for d artagnan				80.11521346244737
everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance at length they reached it but it was not the friend				526.2240344948061
madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album				149133.14779025514
he was yielding to your infernal influence but i will save him				50.35467490860952
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil				217947.4709165874
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple				12377.640357243181
one of our clients is a horsedealer he owes money to the office and is backward in his pay				207042.57779056736
all all all are thine my adored mistress and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table				750.2068213828794
once a soldier what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without fortune with nothing but a half ruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me				126.05719410175836
for life replied porthos in the same manner				804.5267460417283

richelieu the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but he did not return the paper to d artagnan				80.11452583100548

pale and trembling milady repulsed d artagnan s attempted embrace by a violent blow on the chest as she sprang out of bed				692.0301052591376
edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided				186892.2533063455

he would no longer be alone				861.0035282708807
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window				533.2705492730045
edmond it is not madame de morcerf who is come to you it is mercédès mercédès is dead madame said monte cristo i know no one now of that name mercédès lives sir and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your voice edmond by the simple sound of your voice and from that moment she has followed your steps watched you feared you and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes m de morcerf fernand do you mean replied monte cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling names let us remember them all monte cristo had pronounced the name of fernand with such an expression of hatred that mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every vein				201503.3041587153
the cardinal therefore rose to open it				89.14726704176844
neffer neffer d artagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out				528.1924352992461

nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past yes well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man extraordinary did you say yes you have known him for some time then scarcely longer than eight or ten days and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days				1678.9891406887675

then morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen				3037.115229994014
while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriage contract were being carried on at the house of m de villefort monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to m danglars wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenant general which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chaussée d antin				18452.90456434898
the queen attributed this joyous feeling to the beauty of the fête to the pleasure she had experienced in the ballet and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen whether she smile or weep everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of the city of paris				458.21692206865623

when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m noirtier s eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son				1000.8210695688003
uncertainty is still hope then in a low voice morrel added this delay is not natural				228666.1302976134
you are speaking you scoundrel said athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing grimaud with his flaming look				945.4100670750971
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him				50.35450683202942
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within				4101.359065120626
madame de saint méran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint méran at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentine or still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to 80 000 livres per annum and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp				761.1536502709049

the woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon stifled				245841.71208645712
the explosion soon followed the upper rock was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder the lower one flew into pieces thousands of insects escaped from the aperture dantès had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the treasure rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared				585.3338505956872
the young man s finger glided over the words but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign				5183.634638671137
he was alone alone with these countless these unheard of treasures				41431.85962108731
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread				15519.502730844748
albert led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite apartment				938.6846256365013
why it was he who carried me off that may be madame and you receive silver from that man have you not said that that abduction was entirely political yes but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor and perhaps the life of my august mistress madame replied bonacieux your august mistress is a perfidious spaniard and what the cardinal does is well done monsieur said the young woman i know you to be cowardly avaricious and foolish but i never till now believed you infamous madame said bonacieux who had never seen his wife in a passion and who recoiled before this conjugal anger madame what do you say i say you are a miserable creature continued mme				194.54755129694092

when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost				211076.60153473075
this voice was that of my father				447.63414121187157
where are you murmured coquenard and he tried to smile				397.66464697672836
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers				844.8201979788205
selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token				178613.82258111765

something whispers me so continued porthos becoming more and more melancholy				6076.771162045526
grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes				9465.228917390052
he rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of mordaunt				1926.7171664325385
but although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his appearance				2014.3258566728186

the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugénie s character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection				12979.241198111693

the wife of athos we have now to search for athos said d artagnan to the vivacious aramis when he had informed him of all that had passed since their departure from the capital and an excellent dinner had made one of them forget his thesis and the other his fatigue				8065.591115512188

meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos				145.03864679248733
your name the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times possibly madame				1009.3268651950872

he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to him				50.339490253662625
i tremble to give my permission listen valentine				683.9399888831805
then another error seized me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen i was afraid you were dangerously ill the two men in black who guessed d artagnan s meaning darted at him a glance which might have been thought threatening but d artagnan took no heed of it				88.82652195163874
the two friends having agreed to leave blaisois and grimaud at compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres				24345.595746530456
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow				1893.6190116770415
it was just two o clock by albert s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing room				219.26639350555166
the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared				585.3821384322357
then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword				947.8141147007761
i forgot to ask you where are you taking me to the cardinal what does he want with me i do not know				1128.711996616866
there was a postscript i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent in his convent				6507.739329209066
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill joined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars				455.0963467546834
of aramis yes since he has become an abbé				798.1589157634905
at one of the extremities of the camp near an immense tent in which the scottish officers were holding a kind of council presided over by lord leven their commander a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf his right hand extended over his sword				947.8123068905444
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it yes said danglars				455.0963467546834
danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment				574.0992418657054
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen what is this madame he asked coldly				33641.35878202904
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose				2220.23648877166
villefort sprang into the room ran to valentine and took her in his arms				513.9799012889156
then it was the will of god that it should be so and this it is which makes it all so awful continued grimaud				811.9211958288589
on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to faria s dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen				170676.20432949165
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out it would be very easy if you much wished it how so probably you have some correspondent in greece i should think so at yanina everywhere well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today do so i will 30259m and if you should hear of anything very scandalous i will communicate it to you you will oblige me danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coupé				223017.45087586233
signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied				2881.376600251441
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down				837.4770719649161
i have not yet had time to see him again				392.1006302001893
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two soldiers				3864.561499443972
well upon my honor said athos your eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several ill looking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces a quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know i don t like quarrelers and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in fault what have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his brow				1392.3092610478982
and we too added beauchamp and château renaud				889.7973057953704
the quarters of monsieur were at dompierre the quarters of the king were sometimes at estrée sometimes at jarrie the cardinal s quarters were upon the downs at the bridge of la pierre in a simple house without any entrenchment				192726.86067488053
five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs				15714.950835826352
this was albert s favorite lounging place				1081.0857198432045
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye				2053.823737184318
at the first sight of his old friend danglars assumed his majestic air and settled himself in his easy chair				1143.330031011053
there is the prince de condé the hero of rocroy				199084.1289330819
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting				18103.415407430653
this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted				7619.020747362402
whilst the two friends were with the cardinal the queen sent for him				50.34984893288705
no i have good luck that is all				336.0235041627957
athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said trifles only trifles that was his favorite word				527.2588541228371
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarin s niece				176191.1426144191
what is to happen said porthos				145.9189455454419
make haste dear lodger said he there is a very pretty girl waiting for you upstairs and you know women don t like to be kept waiting that s kitty said d artagnan to himself and darted into the passage				2868.654536738512
where is athos in the cellar monsieur what you scoundrel				39481.28039234102
besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond replied the old man				179.0428939559423
my lord he said which way do we go				1838.44603779326
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him				50.338398095364205
tell me have you ever thought that seven times 1 700 000 francs make nearly twelve millions				5183.896650751435
to all the simple things which escaped our gascon milady replied with a smile of kindness				6856.252301932054
do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come i have been advised of it but the three millions the three millions are probably on the road then i shall really have them oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment				574.0986943622644
50195m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtier s room				219.2809270437821
there is one thing only which i must request what is it				88.85253221185762
very little except long live cromwell where were you placed mordaunt tried for a moment to read in the general s face if this was simply a useless question or whether he knew everything				1025.3412291356656
now said the steward what have you to tell me and you said andrea				3040.801710230023
then taking a passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months longer chapter 105				217940.1962563102
what monseigneur said d artagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself				264.2504015459588
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements				13120.494242713155
tell them this athos resumed d artagnan thus shall all die who forget that a captive man is sacred and that a captive king doubly represents the lord athos repeated d artagnan s words				832.9897709376306
we left paris each with seventy five pistoles in his pocket shall i see you again before your departure i think not monsieur unless something new should happen well a pleasant journey thanks monsieur d artagnan left m de tréville touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his musketeers				844.8197951372541
the people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing				206611.9902147477
he was her grandfather on the mother s side				823.9260745615416
there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill will towards me				126.06254389440053
his brain was on fire and life and energy returned				1438.810648908471
i shall return very safely to the louvre all alone as you please madame bonacieux said the ex mercer				11313.539724853208
bonacieux against buckingham but above all against d artagnan projects lost in the distance of the future				1442.260263244155
he is walking about and thinking thought d artagnan but of what				670.1110386887116
now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me i wish to speak with this gentleman 20045m and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson french who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have mentioned				15492.707290850183
it was said that she had poisoned her second husband she had tried to assassinate her brother in law she had just poisoned a young woman who was her rival and before leaving england she had it was believed caused the favorite of the king to be murdered buckingham cried the monk				11714.042618282687
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd				2126.7710963783334
you remain minister that is understood said d artagnan france needs you and i desist from my pretensions said aramis				151.47347660672236
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart alas my dear aramis said d artagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are relating how yes a woman whom i love whom i adore has just been torn from me by force				3122.194351307735
what must i do above all things be always on your guard				1394.0457901981354
all the nobility of rome will be present and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society she must go there whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned albert				433.8002402510458
i adore rome and i have always had a great taste for archæology 20189m come two or three more such adventures and i do not despair of seeing you a member of the academy doubtless albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready				2158.6379915180178
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal				410.112621462029
the lackey bowed and let them pass				2390.7369782233554
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornélie				54567.83358338301
they have abducted her added the commissary and do you know the man who has committed this deed i think i know him who is he remember that i affirm nothing monsieur the commissary and that i only suspect whom do you suspect				194203.79934718853
the four countenances expressed four different feelings that of porthos tranquillity that of d artagnan hope that of aramis uneasiness that of athos carelessness				15185.069741767868

wasn t i right to part with the horses madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt				3745.261383499743
m de morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it nothing could be in better taste than my father s demeanor madame said albert nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years				880.6914691430138

madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project				20216.997380998964
the air i breathe is the air of liberty				3156.188233288938
i say i am entirely of porthos s opinion replied aramis				151.52361126006664
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way				676.9279037773875

if we had only been looking for porthos porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him				50.338758144932285
this event might have three causes the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majesty s guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a well furnished purse in his pocket				1334.3103601619662

lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly				33641.35878202904

i have brought her here sir and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold well water the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an old friend of the family of la valliere went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage				673.3711588342037

the duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like st laurence on his gridiron				217915.46422756746
why really i know no one said the major				3137.1176858518297
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice				15332.932650995624
the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment				893.7689973408831
debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the minister and besides albert looked at his tablets it is the hour i told the count 21st may at half past ten and though i do not much rely upon his promise i wish to be punctual				208338.14267195764
there is very little amusement in the cloister and the good superior was eager to make the acquaintance of her new boarder				144064.09891054998
i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death yes i know you are a man of a stout heart monsieur said the cardinal with a voice almost affectionate i can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried and even condemned another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket				1334.3103601619662
lovely women yielding to the influence of the scene bend over their balconies or lean from their windows and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the air seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers				1935.9254857897158
the queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer perhaps you like repose she said				496.5776321216681
it shall be as you wish madame said villefort more especially since your wishes coincide with mine and as soon as m d épinay arrives in paris 30319m my dear grandmother interrupted valentine consider decorum the recent death				781.2255279552935

let him run on said danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says				23847.62991826585
however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible				5346.707046274096
villefort was about to retire but m de blacas taking his hand restrained him				50.34631978078104
why should i but still there are some signals only addressed to you certainly and do you understand them they are always the same and they mean nothing new you have an hour or tomorrow this is simple enough said the count but look is not your correspondent putting itself in motion ah yes thank you sir and what is it saying anything you understand yes it asks if i am ready and you reply by the same sign which at the same time tells my right hand correspondent that i am ready while it gives notice to my left hand correspondent to prepare in his turn it is very ingenious said the count				288.84445045090274
this is not my weakness i tell you at once family joys have no charm for me				126.06260400572006
then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with regret				15021.661451653381
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of you you know what i have done i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady				406.598547254682
athos said she wait a moment and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment				574.0997893696685
ah yes he said as if awaking from a dream				1101.7555372166335

the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered				11202.258165440075
gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it				88.82656430743515
ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to m baptistin this portion of the building was interdicted to him				50.3402463771348
if i bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of england what is your name then asked mazarin				778.4715300555298
two men to the astonishment of d artagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier				12032.110665849157
now i think of it you can do better said danglars				455.1571127287942
they still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top				15275.6024311518
this is torture to me cried athos				153.19893836891873
as for what you do me the honor to say i presume you mean i was afraid the queen smiled				559.2812777614843
but what s going on in the city yonder said athos				152.88149609183853

still further athos obtained of m de tréville six days instead of four and introduced into these six days two more nights for they set out on the twenty fourth at five o clock in the evening and as a further kindness m de tréville post dated the leave to the morning of the twenty fifth				34140.058156879604
mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away				594.9505418287123
i am well i want nothing do not call him she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room				219.26064309093903
and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself				1888.5980660522478
one man alone remained in his place gun in hand				232.06559154009753
porthos linked his arm in that of his friend				526.4637206951468
m cavalcanti his father had been seen in paris and it was expected that he would re appear to claim the illustrious outcast				149920.72576512338

and when did you arrive here inquired she				716.5531325509465
monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds				42456.31426072731
the bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain				9058.421851719448

everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts				849.4404891405754
un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin it doesn t surprise me said d artagnan in a low tone to porthos that mazarin would have been much better satisfied had i crushed the life out of his councillor you understand then monsieur resumed planchet that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against monsieur broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine no don t be alarmed but where did you get all these details from a good source sir i heard it from friquet from friquet				13262.57622689277

d artagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired				2665.831596894162
i was promised he should die with me				126.22597215382658

franz found himself in utter darkness				1137.510352510804
besides this he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men each capable of killing three d artagnans with two musketeers in short with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men				602.2573426958106
i really believe you are a man and a violent one too and you you are a woman a miserable woman stupid and brutal				205048.89898109576

poor danglars looked so crest fallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air towards him				50.34273086279492
if he turned up an ace first he won if a king he lost				1014.5333078119945
the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtier s lips seemed to start from his eyes				492.37690939233323
each word that fell from his companion s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth				7281.166625368284
i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin				9815.9498548752
but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peter s and a month to study it				88.82859740941393
who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed				213478.7737775017
my dear cousin i think i shall make up my mind to set out for béthune where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the carmelites this poor child is quite resigned as she knows she can not live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger				4832.876955194632
go the lackey bowed to the ground and departed				17003.860384678468
the time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and dantès fate would be decided				256764.22842922382
she was talking with great animation with the stranger				1692.3077027383397
gentlemen replied d artagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence				1735.4798266155303
what shall i do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall i ring				3454.9490199511647
when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol				14472.059351222046
can it be on account of the amours of madame de bois tracy said d artagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court affairs				3697.6902180500424
the count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to morrel fixing a long steadfast glance upon him				50.33877014662891
wait what are you going to do asked aramis				151.6073745742279
friend mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of supplies mousqueton said d artagnan you must render me a service what monsieur you must give your recipe to planchet				662.2888498528151
and as we are prevented from going down there we are forced to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house so that our hostelry is daily going to ruin				9816.127719652719
ah monsieur bonacieux i never did love you much but now it is worse than ever				1264.4398908969558
as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that lord wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck				3176.6801647082643
one plays with anybody but one fights only with equals and that is but just said athos and he took aside the one of the four englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low voice				412.8276861445323
oh yes she exclaimed i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching brain				2187.5520371758394
my dear athos you know that i am not alluding to you you are the pearl of brave bold men				602.2668196668068
it is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably				12530.915300347811
athos and d artagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent				44841.5646192112
mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him				50.33844610182449
morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair				1143.330031011053
in a dungeon which good lord				698.1588497253649
in the meantime the cortege returned to the palais royal				1984.2070906802624
the door of the back staircase opened then the side gate of the garden and ali and his master were on the spot with lights				13189.683455282564
eh he said negligently this money is not mine				1527.7896567039336
i confess i have seen nothing but the fire let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes				10880.664394631202
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris				458.21692206865623
i know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests				13524.273183469635
the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me monsieur				1109.4266030819615
what are you doing said he				209.75208480847215
give me anything you like it is of little consequence go and fetch lord de winter said felton tired of these eternal complaints				163359.0762010054
it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing room				219.26189771399203
s blood cried he to d artagnan do not kill him young man i beg of you				95.70159366329747

these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him				50.35484298575062
pardon my eagerness for my life depends on your answer				803.5636488058393
he found athos and aramis philosophizing				215391.25600694536
only we conspire against the rochellais ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his eminence				1735.472378760094
la ramee la ramee came into the room				219.57064849366324
before this day closes if m danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die				1384.3955192040553
listen to me he said or rather look upon me look at my face paler even than usual and my eyes red with weariness for four days i have not closed them for i have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for maximilian the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her				164.27416187265285
there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin				778.4770981377247
m de tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news				3113.1853775033464
we two are worth a dozen yes said porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits but we four altogether would be equal to thirty six more especially as you say the work will not be child s play				5690.465406320462
let us leave them she said				498.3419783171434
is our little neighbor worse asked d artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth				7281.08329950583
bonacieux dead and to d artagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life				469.18411209533406
spur spur and he fired two pistols				8063.845232506711
i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack be of good cheer replied dantès your strength will return and as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside faria and took his hands				484.0808461351845
the scheme goes forward it seems on wheels dear friend good				1725.3942096466812
and now now escort me where where i am going but where are you going you will see because you will leave me at the door shall i wait for you that will be useless you will return alone then perhaps yes perhaps no but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman i don t know yet but i will know it how so i will wait until you come out in that case adieu why so i do not want you but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy the word is rather hard how are they called who follow others in spite of them they are indiscreet the word is too mild well madame i perceive i must do as you wish why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once is there no merit in repentance and do you really repent i know nothing about it myself				767.7206588035451
a black point floated on the sea				1716.4513318053066
athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison				10873.558737856774

well go and fetch them and come to my apartment				938.7643017660515
it is you who surrendered the castle of yanina				10149.276871369886
59 quick quick said caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti				1280.7791036021615
you see sir he is really dead said the doctor this burn in the heel is decisive				176251.81151451974
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted				33874.89500243771
laporte pointed to the child who was asleep				3191.7086881184455
on beholding this house d artagnan calm as he was in general felt an unusual disturbance within his heart so powerful during the whole course of life are the recollections of youth				7281.159681509991
mordaunt did the same and recognized the gentleman around whom the three other frenchmen were standing pale and menacing				36498.1307855447
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him				50.341602627055735
in order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an unclasped and long pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him				50.33831408416887
the gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chained up dog went up to the cabin				12902.244341468206
ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen				6422.066022898536
no one had taken up the remark about the general and no one had recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble count in the house of peers				192933.19313866613
when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution				220567.04474948777
the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way				676.9304860573365
they will no doubt bleed him therefore i will retire for i can not endure the sight of blood and she followed her husband upstairs				10230.527367491573
oh then you were glad to hear that m morrel i didn t dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old man s being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor				1403.2894992834429
she sighed as she looked at him				50.54539422591041
the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread				222838.22861750008
devil take these puritans said mazarin aside they are carved from granite then he added aloud but you have relations left you i have one remaining				165316.70283361856
is it to do us some ill turn				1019.9625896482688
monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine 29 with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercédès seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly				15689.523596440093
he listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the darkness				1135.6129690830267
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five and forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year 1829 your excellency in what month june the beginning or the end the evening of the 3rd 20303m ah said monte cristo the evening of the 3rd of june 1829				22205.446603060376
on their way they met grimaud				814.9295232641807
yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall				855.5677222016934
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertaker s men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial				185976.77423521312
and you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a poacher yes monsieur and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a line				4432.897109147429
valentine tell him if you love maximilian the count felt his heart dilate and throb he opened his arms and haydée uttering a cry sprang into them				157.70634832098477
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road				2062.9498515828036
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other				472.0959348078575
or he will forget us added d artagnan				80.25771857423385
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo				202.14335563850557
this key was furnished with a small iron point a negligence on the part of the locksmith				210887.06365389298
what the devil could that handkerchief signify placed where he was d artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis				151.47253764326496
the lackeys were sent to their several posts except that grimaud lay on a truss of straw across the doorway				28794.002601305423
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue				5532.071425663676
for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne				217947.05521517317
the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame danglars into her box the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half hour s interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes				91243.8067258695
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate				167880.83212022335
the rest concerns myself don t be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis				151.48395005520115
but would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope milady answered by a glance which said is that all speak then and then accompanying the glance with explanatory words that is but too just said she tenderly				7269.454816358036
then after a moment of reverie he remembered where he had left d artagnan and porthos and that they must have overheard everything				1025.3446515869625
d artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale				32574.869202702404
roman bandits the next morning franz woke first and instantly rang the bell				6728.393470201683
the road as d artagnan had observed was the way to blois				14500.933526803025
then by degrees the reality broke upon me full of chaste terrors				155744.1398352273
one day when he was seven years old he came to the curate of palestrina and asked to be taught to read it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which having no other name was called borgo he told luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it				88.82652195163874
i was executioner of the city of lille as this woman has said				496.6268861909105
i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet m and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this				1451.2173616030311
if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperor s intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched my friend said my mother when your master s orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly				115243.91222084526
d artagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will execute well said d artagnan i decide that we should adopt athos s plan and that we set off in half an hour agreed shouted the three musketeers in chorus				8252.17718381174
they are yours take them mordaunt delighted advanced porthos looking at d artagnan with open mouthed astonishment				893.6884525215769
he still doubts thought milady i have not been earnest enough someone was heard in the corridor milady recognized the step of lord de winter				673.7578602498444
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened				18817.088783736246
ali having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eyes and feigned to sleep				1402.5536376530345
his excellency the count of monte cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion they resolved to profit by the count s courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained				246828.38909342122
oh yes returned monte cristo i make no secret of it				88.86282827827313
for added he the future can not fail to mend i inevitably look for better times				5613.875383053149
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded				67467.41532728485
there remained three leagues to travel and they did it amid torrents of rain				20935.640225730753
it is thus that a wounded man trembles instinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be healed but villefort s was one of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever				1264.4230089157752
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying				157730.80542564433
0323m like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display				166085.4925008171
sign it then caderousse signed it				89.63382718429126
this is a woman of twenty six or twenty eight years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall well made				3640.612817281464
but still we have quite lost our dear eugénie for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire				162780.24868031233
you are brave monsieur d artagnan continued his eminence you are prudent which is still better				1072.6281453031854
ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully				10016.160028470145
in june the profit amounted to 900 000				5087.496440354152
true monsieur said mousqueton and five hundred feet from here is a small hunting house mousqueton thy pistols said d artagnan				80.11517526054575
where for for la rochelle he need not sail cried milady forgetting her usual presence of mind				473.32281568493806
m danglars would give double that sum to attain the same end am i indeed so happy said albert who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow				1392.308597143265
that mood lasted some time but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs which make one die of laughing and du vallon asked athos				152.84526929433272
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath				6184.887654557714
he had within his reach his pistols and carbine and ali standing near him held one of the small arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the crusades				255011.82826941716
at this moment my mother seized me in her arms and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private staircase of the kiosk where was a scene of frightful tumult and confusion				10554.977182009214
never mind renée replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a woman s nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love				978.2488856944072
the men i have put to flight will return reinforced if they find us here we are lost				1014.4858997361126
he placed the casket on the table then opening it took out a little golden box the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring				27920.003824240284
behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her				164.28309196616263
the first named malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato				229336.81417608663
i will not acknowledge a crime in my house for when crime enters a dwelling it is like death it does not come alone listen				5015.777787117636
they don t burn sorcerers nowadays no				414.41301534775926

why if you sought concealment did you call your horse vampa that was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the count of morcerf never visit the opera				5802.788322626461
all these proofs of an energetic resolution which albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother				1345.4168778490377
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared				1102.8914209425195
he would be condemned to die but he was about to die of grief and despair when this miraculous noise recalled him to life				469.1709125403066

a burning fire a red hot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my shoulder felton uttered a groan				2126.139391281534
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d artagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m de tréville s private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl				180707.37422704758
ah ah said the chief i now understand why carlini stayed behind all savage natures appreciate a desperate deed				17758.47911895968

on the contrary that simplifies the matter greatly				41454.94134836073
i will bless you i i am dying cried mordaunt come to me				126.0751077832262
at this announcement during which the door remained open everyone became mute and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel				233343.45091597675
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances d artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once				2015.0511688155211

i am afraid that what was first done was unskillful if not worse than useless				13596.96611226937
did you pass through the corso yes well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross				18571.295333484937

scarron seemed not to observe that certain of his guests had talked mysteriously that letters had passed from hand to hand and that the assembly had seemed to have a secret purpose quite apart from the literary discussion carried on with so much ostentation				217947.26306578118
the two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo s table and that of signor pastrini				11551.696114763481
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes				492.3764398253447

occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him sometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a president or some dowager duchess				4095.8985323743855
great therefore was the astonishment when at the end of the month he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality				8778.794157137072
hang it cried d artagnan another twenty pistoles lost				1014.9242670033564
they accepted his offer but wishing to make the best use of the time that was left albert started for naples				8442.089325945137

monte cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint				25949.955425837536

i think nothing i quote a fact that is all				335.77171935131906
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried d artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other why does she love what we hate most in the world the spaniards and the english spain is her country replied d artagnan and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself				1007.5918834078747
d artagnan had not failed in his career but circumstances had been adverse to him				50.34415919749794

raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old				1559.4544264002554
yes sire yes it is the same and your majesty has a good memory come how shall we decide said the king				425.00427508836555
the duke was the grandson of henry iv				1176.1482361483816
he recognized albert but thought it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomposed				215439.53349713667
i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around				2223.041673853959
here s a good opportunity for getting something better than a diamond you are right d artagnan i held a similar project but as i had not nor ever shall have your fruitful vigorous imagination the idea was suggested to me				126.05725421052689

now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant				41977.77344884235
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent				175294.81139602995
is it from mere humanity you bid me live				6535.7960926392

the moccoli or moccoletti are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with first how to keep his own moccoletto alight and secondly how to extinguish the moccoletti of others				1416.834962487623
albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments				4010.2999685672307
to see him so self satisfied reconciles me with myself				767.9169015479595

sir suddenly exclaimed the countess after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply i have suffered deeply madame answered monte cristo				202.14335563850557
aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud				2588.972656952912
then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the room and to the stairs exclaiming energetically julie julie emmanuel emmanuel monte cristo endeavored also to leave but maximilian would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door which he closed upon the count				288.84445045090274
porthos agreed to the bargain the thing suited him wonderfully well				642.7564962543512
at this moment danglars who had been incessantly observing every change in fernand s look and manner saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a seat placed near one of the open windows				1467.8884230590886
what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition mademoiselle replied morrel with a bitter smile i am selfish you have already said so and as a selfish man i think not of what others would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself				767.7206588035451

they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which half paris assembled was to sign				5183.634638671137

if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker s feet he could not have experienced greater terror				1755.3469191191484
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me d artagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl				14200.849855243401

then turning toward the second musketeer d artagnan said monsieur du verger help me to place this man in a place of safety the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready				2158.6379915180178

and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion				2052.3239369893195
