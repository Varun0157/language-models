it was a béarn pony from twelve to fourteen years old yellow in his hide without a hair in his tail but not without windgalls on his legs which though going with his head lower than his knees rendering a martingale quite unnecessary contrived nevertheless to perform his eight leagues a day				321.7174044885062
oh dearest marie				1321123.655939679
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry				10404.010067640836
what can you expect replied aramis in a tone of resignation				469728.34656529635

planchet prouder than ever of his new duties deigned to explain to the two gentlemen that he was ordered to take up his position on the place royale with two hundred men forming the rear of the army of paris and to march on charenton when necessary				11375.510701522231
and if i give you this password said she would you forget it as soon as you used it by my honor by the faith of a gentleman said d artagnan with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it				13.16951516166618
d artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a most minute observer and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future life				312.0616545303244
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course				1394.1122650663074
i shall either return for them myself or shall send a courier directing you to bring them to me				8.258427450228844
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner				643.083297838354
cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend s entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to rita s father at frosinone				951613.2329530439
curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito and he was recognized				777.6857165407866
ma foi said monte cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you m de villefort				4.477070112099606
no indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected				26387.30529096781
what did you answer him that the thing was impossible seeing that you were not at home as he could see well what did he say then that you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day and then he added in a low voice tell your master that his eminence is very well disposed toward him and that his fortune perhaps depends upon this interview the snare is rather maladroit for the cardinal replied the young man smiling				226.12085704904342
on no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although i during his absence watched in his place yes i know it said the soldier				1200.1162682771283
who would ever have thought it d artagnan only sighed				1842.6516968655023
bonacieux who had sent for m laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time				158.98911413569428
i must have wronged you in some way at marseilles				473.85372899578397
as far as you yourself are concerned i see but one point in which you are really guilty				2520.1487629252024
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there won t be any parliament at all and who is this colonel bridge asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it				23.911740523006102
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect				5525.68612650211
at half past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour				373.18501593229144
alas murmured edmond can it be he moved his bed drew up the stone rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the secret entrance was open				2603.238406343018
hold yourself as bolt upright as on the day of the bastion of st gervais and do not bow too low to this italian that might give him a poor idea of you good answered porthos				13.209360446918438
we ought to die together				1062.754441645114
yes a telegraph				1072015.1721316425
yes but listen this was not all				91.08869186575811
an hour afterwards the carriage was again ordered and this time it went to the rue fontaine saint georges and stopped at no				693.6294110652665
the officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon deck				15988.828495625352
she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder				1920.7510006750151
you have continued your course of villany you have robbed you have assassinated well i should say				103.80847423433052
he criticised everybody humorously				2238430.3431597357
besides it began to grow late and then as today people went to bed early in the quarter of the luxembourg				749.8427441896746
the point aimed at by every poniard				7264995.694345129
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them				20.933472042344587
follow me then said the abbé as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès				525.4780672906859
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he can not recollect when he received it				6.781908820542004
an entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as carmela was safe and uninjured				7943739.009926611
the count de rochefort grimaud nodded the third time				72.43890043899756
and the name of this lord lord de winter lord de winter exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband				353.19948292650554
dantès meanwhile went on his way				256.27529830476607
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer i am prepared for anything				274.4245817633152
the major will bring his son with him this evening the contino as we say in italy he confides him to my care				1985.284094363766
it had not been used				434.10193543603555
then taking the glass with a firm hand she said drink				2493013.9360834337
constance constance cried d artagnan				1.0422369251665482
thus the greater number of a man s errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a moment of excitement of delirium or of fear we see that we might have avoided and escaped it				6.190200822953884
a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain				978.290868482934
it was day				1225.219302860835
aim at this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that d artagnan could not repress a burst of homeric laughter				3996.0217419755977
athos took the letter from the hands of d artagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder				3839634.424968023
d artagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend				1971.7083264830837
he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio				3535891.2675811998
you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you an agreeable one asked the italian				8378.709407580482
wait for me cried he i will soon be back and he set off at a gallop				405.76048775839877
i defy you to find him who executed it silence said a hollow voice				41.76182764145812
and then it must be confessed fernand had never been hated he was only not precisely loved				60283.34498342857
on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall oh god he read preserve my memory oh yes he cried that was my only prayer at last i no longer begged for liberty but memory i dreaded to become mad and forgetful				3339640.5813202
sire said winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are ready the king looked at the three gentlemen				2378.6744742150895
well said he to morcerf but i think your father will not be the only angry one m and madame danglars will think me a very ill mannered person				1215.2487266996006
but why do you ask i will tell you replied the young girl for it is but right you should know				130.24051523334225
tis a very strong post he resumed and we have forty good men tried soldiers having no connection with frondeurs nor any interest in the fronde if we put these three men together monsieur comminges said mazarin we must double the guard and we are not rich enough in fighting men to commit such acts of prodigality comminges smiled mazarin read and construed that smile				532.7942353783754
is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself				812.5083337806259
sir said albert at first with a tremulous voice but which gradually became firmer i reproached you with exposing the conduct of m de morcerf in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i thought you had no right to punish him but i have since learned that you had that right				336.7390442373229
she has a fruitful imagination and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps after the first and at these words lord de winter passed his arm through that of felton and led him out laughing				5220.888605558096
coquenard had met porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his handsome spanish genet she would not have regretted the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband				474.82925873418714
d artagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down				118.33549964816456
my vocation commands me it carries me away d artagnan smiled but made no answer				147.58972029425024
the englishman delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition pressed d artagnan in his arms and paid a thousand compliments to the three musketeers and as porthos s adversary was already installed in the carriage and as aramis s had taken to his heels they had nothing to think about but the dead				260.47345444389197
it is sacrilege to struggle against so many things my lord				22.86981055012352
i accelerate your ruin				24419.843071392228
oh god exclaimed the poor queen raising her eyes to heaven have you indeed taken back all the generous hearts that once existed in the world i hope not madame replied de winter thoughtfully i once spoke to you of four men what can be done with four four devoted resolute men can do much assure yourself madame and those of whom i speak performed great things at one time and where are these four men ah that is what i do not know				154.7262533068989
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another				170.20253608900305
nevertheless d artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage				3280403.8459865944
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive				5892.533423872614
but he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to la bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemy s movements				869530.5703970719
the host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day but he had reckoned without his guest				57849.49561447526
the procurator s wife waited tremblingly				3307639.8371420302
as for porthos he dreamed that the panels of his carriage were not capacious enough to contain the armorial bearings he had ordered to be painted on them				50.966573013359394
d artagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance				2429.74541487676
sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies				667290.1411942345
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch s blood fell down insensible				3569.8190778186786
come come murmured d artagnan rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of rochefort				898.1651893640743
therefore in spite of olivain s remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him				254.39543444698302
the air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning				429.3027578584505
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible monsieur de comminges said athos i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me i will do it with all my heart said comminges for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty i know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested				821.4491698246775
marie michon continued athos				6.027529630187808
therefore d artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort				1335.973277289427
then he rested he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be going				571.3889462920066
eight o clock found franz up and dressed while albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep				500.0396260651009
lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near				7587.326883851597
my father died but i did not die				97.97272663741418
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmond s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts thanks danglars that will smooth over all difficulties				142702.98720310233
like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display				2088407.36626075
m de tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news				24657.15824511961
he walked to the window and looked into the court				1246.9990905502534
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done				88.44803454555208
what men call the chances of fate namely ruin change circumstances i have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me				6.233501992853163
silence silence begone said kitty				515.1723942311961
what new gibberish is that he says he is german my lord replied raoul but i doubt it for his accent is bad and his pronunciation defective then you speak german also asked the prince				170.82046267565752
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears				510.0056122356769
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no				686.8745699533819
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart				29.589743764792065
buckingham in paris cried he and why does he come to conspire no doubt with your enemies the huguenots and the spaniards no pardieu no				37.0541908343218
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears				7930.397222951476
what is he waiting for asked another				2163.3656757575477
be easy on that head replied athos you know i am cool enough porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe				4327284.733392266
notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna he slid down like peppino and closing his eyes fell upon his feet				106.01543631972682
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen				2359885.748171309
aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it				9.755903241006196
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat				1907.996783012363
the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions				13681.579133994894
during this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease				9113.77484161065
gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose				9697.474238467683
we will invoke the remembrance of that poor de winter for whom he seemed to have a great regard we will tell him that we have come as amateurs to see what is going on we will spend with him a guinea each per day and i think that by taking all these precautions we can be quite undisturbed you forget aramis one precaution of considerable importance what is that the precaution of changing our clothes changing our clothes exclaimed porthos				11.350068462682756
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay and before lens the enemy s entire army				360.019597093402
it was planchet who brought into play profitably the recollections of the regiment of piedmont				2227006.746908427
since he had been taken he had not uttered a word so that it was not known to what country he belonged				75115.40110930694
the countess de winter as they rode along the duke endeavored to draw from d artagnan not all that had happened but what d artagnan himself knew				2398.2842146368985
i hope that you will sometimes too think of me and if at certain hours you should miss me if you should feel any slight regret at my absence i shall be overwhelmed with joy at the thought that you appreciate my affection for and my devotion to yourself and that i have been able to prove them to you whilst i had the happiness of living with you after finishing this letter raoul felt more composed he looked well around him to see if olivain and the host might not be watching him whilst he impressed a kiss upon the paper a mute and touching caress which the heart of athos might well divine on opening the letter				195.675241924439
porthos was the first who came to himself				69.72289691188705
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault château renaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees				1086.4897845191026
well answered the old man by closing his eyes but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness				1672.4130782804014
he was an honest man said d artagnan				1.0450772046487335
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped for				95.64187729668343
the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerf s are you not no replied madame danglars i am too ill you are wrong replied villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen there do you think so asked the baroness				453.38219093405934
there was only this blow wanting then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile				2949815.06493693
a square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle occupied the center of the room				96.01153915628282
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency charles shook his head				12.688385966018638
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us				53.971377786452436
what for				7651.219129101045
it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form				792.5924706980159
he left the box and dice where they fell threw the purse to the wounded man and eagerly opened the pocketbook				4110579.1055870773
d artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal				67.33730638359003
the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew it				10.910380962249503
ah is that you d artagnan and you athos said the young man				1.8174971987107293
i dragged myself as far as the yard				2174153.0285362448
i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends				1552.359512647171
he was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his hand				19.852295353623326
i do not understand italian yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant s shoulder				977.3033510771929
thus all may go well all may be for the best but we do not go far from this place seven or eight leagues at the most				4138763.189318626
has this woman been relating her crimes to you				18.295389947998054
pardon me monsieur said d artagnan who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back m de tréville s clock three quarters of an hour but i thought as it was yet only twenty five minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon you twenty five minutes past nine cried m de tréville looking at the clock why that s impossible look rather monsieur said d artagnan the clock shows it that s true said m de tréville i believed it later				1814.957913523127
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle then i am also a puzzle to your mother				309.646016814937
the rest of mademoiselle eugénie s person was in perfect keeping with the head just described she indeed reminded one of diana as château renaud observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute				59757.6560937821
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me this time at least i do not deserve your thanks				1223.7630990686025
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself				125.66990846123801
she pointed to each letter of the alphabet				5014723.635283521
i never was in a law court i am told it is so very amusing amusing certainly replied the young man inasmuch as instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a law court a case of real and genuine distress a drama of life				267.45557961303894

the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise d artagnan had made and opening the door said come in all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that d artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard				738.1872377693933
how my fault yes i offered you escape by pulling out a bar and pushing down a door certainly porthos men like us can t go out from here purely and simply faith said porthos as for me i could go out with that purity and that simplicity which it seems to me you despise too much d artagnan shrugged his shoulders				54.62434694921357

and now raoul said he you are launched you have dukes for friends a marshal of france for godfather a prince of the blood as commander and on the day of your return you have been received by two queens it is not so bad for a novice oh sir said raoul suddenly you recall something which in my haste to relate my exploits i had forgotten it is that there was with her majesty the queen of england a gentleman who when i pronounced your name uttered a cry of surprise and joy he said he was a friend of yours asked your address and is coming to see you what is his name i did not venture to ask sir he spoke elegantly although i thought from his accent he was an englishman ah said athos leaning down his head as if to remember who it could be				104.69451753361544
to what class of society does he belong he was a shepherd boy attached to the farm of the count of san felice situated between palestrina and the lake of gabri he was born at pampinara and entered the count s service when he was five years old his father was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at rome				804.4285432043717
when he had finished he went to a table upon which was a salver with spanish wine and glasses				18154.573987936325
in the first place i was four years making the tools i possess and have been two years scraping and digging out earth hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge stones i should once have deemed impossible to loosen				3694375.487505177
i am going wherever it may please the count to take me said morrel with a smile full of grief i am under his orders for the next month oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself count said julie				246.80282650222762
yes my lord it is i i have the honor to present to you monsieur du vallon that excellent friend of mine in whom your eminence had the kindness to interest yourself formerly and d artagnan held the lamp before the merry face of porthos who now began to comprehend the affair and be very proud of the whole undertaking				36600.11926366028
swear to be mute i never swear my lord i say yes or no and as i am a gentleman i keep my word come then i see that i must trust unreservedly to you believe me my lord it will be your best plan come said mazarin conducting d artagnan into the queen s oratory and desiring him to wait there				248.00518888866785
a few men the least impressed of all by the scene pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature death others expatiating on the grief of the father and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall until at length they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du périer				3978471.553786211

he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure				2665.5214500516854
alas like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances the baldric was glittering with gold in the front but was nothing but simple buff behind				641.9858293442996
the two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent table the very inferior one of signor pastrini				7268.6576004546305
i swear by don t waste time in swearing said d artagnan let us gallop if our horses will consent and the travelers buried their rowels in their horses flanks who thus vigorously stimulated recovered their energies				4278930.59969151

sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selim s fiery lance				9141.412406856749
they carried the man to his bed and called grimaud to dress the wound				1172.2401418027744
tomorrow said he you will be avenged or i shall be dead no said she you will avenge me but you will not be dead				73.08423098765668

your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and i could say to you as that good la ramee said to me of the duc de beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out he did get out nevertheless do you think of escaping in the same way i am a prisoner then parbleu said mazarin i have been proving it to you this last hour and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted				5004.892987614833
i shall hear from you yes thanks thanks dear love adieu the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue				217815.11009792972
i am well i want nothing do not call him she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room				81.13267187628084
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence				187.39964311938954
ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all				211.15500154432019
the count of monte cristo she murmured				1190.843892454338
in ten minutes mazarin and his party were traversing the street les bons enfants behind the theatre built by richelieu expressly for the play of mirame and in which mazarin who was an amateur of music but not of literature had introduced into france the first opera that was ever acted in that country				488.9388239083482
well marquis said monte cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you ah your excellency i am overwhelmed with delight and what are your feelings said monte cristo turning to the young man				2.217246958141577
dantès said i wish to die and had chosen the manner of his death and fearful of changing his mind he had taken an oath to die				882.6484908905483
you killed that woman alas				874.9794841990887
and still further it is very probable i should not have done anything of this if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady as the queen is yours yes said the duke smiling and i even believe that i know that other person it is my lord i have not named her interrupted the young man warmly				27797.259578473444
do you wish these proofs these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed				13667.168941587839
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken				14989.577381528565
that is lucky said blaisois				1323.988543153189
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father				74.01250222071951
come my brother go with me added d artagnan and i will see that you are made a duke no answered porthos mouston has no desire to fight besides they have erected a triumphal arch for me to enter my barony which will kill my neighbors with envy to that i can say nothing returned d artagnan who knew the vanity of the new baron				5577.257493771741
we were coming from syracuse laden with grain				1284798.5817562032
d artagnan overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk				1284.834604757781
dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice				3639667.180535146
yes sir and it was a fierce one his highness the prince charged eleven times in person he is a great commander bragelonne he is a hero sir				322.3752709812996
d artagnan and porthos moved so as to plant themselves between the person entering and the cardinal				146.29062514207774
for my part i declare d artagnan i think it of much more consequence than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into your bosom d artagnan blushed				132.130618822065
besides do you know what is our situation and whether mazarin s arrest wouldn t be rather an encumbrance than an advantage say at once you disapprove of my proposal i think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in france i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free				509.29502126050824
they have rarely been successful				28972787.909756888
princes must be knocked on the head i remember it said athos				4.868284508989353

ah sir cried olivain what are you doing				1050.8328646186008
you here sir he exclaimed do you then never appear but to act as an escort to death busoni turned around and perceiving the excitement depicted on the magistrate s face the savage lustre of his eyes he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes but beyond this he was ignorant				489.9767161964735
i thought i had quite said groslow				694.6690697817485
i remember that at the castle of rueil the cardinal richelieu had some horrible oubliettes constructed oh				2526.4908934968994
i don t think he put the faucet in again				256.2954623595093
thanks murmured the invalid extending one hand				96.98800830343336
what the devil could that handkerchief signify placed where he was d artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis				95.22930932759556
the cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king with an air of condolence very displeasing to me that the day before yesterday those damned musketeers those daredevils he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me those braggarts added he glancing at me with his tiger cat s eye had made a riot in the rue férou in a cabaret and that a party of his guards i thought he was going to laugh in my face had been forced to arrest the rioters				4867306.499661361
what is his name major cavalcanti is he pleased with you so far i have appeared to answer his purpose and who found this father for you the count of monte cristo the man whose house you have just left yes i wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather since he holds the money chest well i will mention you to him				32.97261838609388

oh my god my god murmured he i have so earnestly prayed to you that i hoped my prayers had been heard				398.1336671537959
providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month				3447.0503120057156
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him yes yes cried both young men				1278.3403682523538
yes said he				9.634540724611556
the two friends were perfectly stupefied				2476.4855057863138
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinal s cap then he added so my friend it s your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape that s my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it				6.6523000591180725
they saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned				10366864.932531487

does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris she inquired				541.6678219058814
in fact he slowly and respectfully approached the prelate and spoke to him privately a few words to which the latter responded by an affirmative sign				1255.0917911600259
you have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but i give you leave to try them upon this one				956.5679454959336
he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street				218.43769724709207
you seem sir she remarked to be making me undergo a course of cross examination which you answer according to your fancy replied mazarin				31.16775240712696
there is a proposition almost like it in the augustinus of the heresiarch jansenius whose book will sooner or later be burned by the hands of the executioner				685.8930175210254
i rushed towards the staircase clutching my hair and uttering a groan of horror				66860.3302403459
now i think we are rich since instead of the francs we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of but we owe something in this house thirty francs but i pay that out of my francs that is understood and as i require only eighty francs for my journey you see i am overwhelmed with luxury				1524970.8996122675
good heavens madame said the count are you ill or is it the heat of the room that affects you are you ill mother cried the viscount springing towards her				16.912024269902577
imagine a man who has transacted business with me for i don t know how long to the amount of or francs during the year				470.93286091364945
the king s authority will put all this to rights was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion yes said the queen it is requested the coadjutor bowed				12414.228443481681
well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in god s sight				15341.386857570553
a nobleman retired from service is he not yes and who had a lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldn t have too much information				1772.4799807588768
it is the insect with black claws and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance go then for in the course of two hours it will be dark and you will not be able to see anything ma foi you frighten me				11.230512615408985

as soon as they arrived at the spot where groslow stood they stopped as if guessing that he was the man they wanted				577.7844957568972
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice work slowly said the curate we leave you in an excellent tone of mind yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone another upon the highway or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest aves cœli comederunt illam plague stifle you and your latin said d artagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted				23203.495627645145
as to the sailors of the pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared				151.88501300155193
in the court of the old chateau of saint germain he entered his coach and reached the seine at chatou				6837287.780351014
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice				1771.19745519256
signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem				8598720.622147081
that s it				64.65161097902461
without that what would become of me it was one o clock in the morning				158.34579047641714
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish				205634.23139643949
he is awaiting your majesty at cours la reine but in what carriage do we start i have provided for everything a carriage below is waiting for your majesty let us go to the king d artagnan bowed and followed the queen				19.676460958572818
there are several branches of the d artagnans at tarbes and in its environs said the cardinal to which do you belong i am the son of him who served in the religious wars under the great king henry the father of his gracious majesty that is well				111.59775915161158
is that all you want yes valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m noirtier s room				112.71936107671537

bonacieux mechanically yes let us be gone milady made her a sign to sit down opposite poured her a small glass of spanish wine and helped her to the wing of a chicken				26594.0098699299
hardly had d artagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication				59503.682926876936
you aramis know anne of austria better than i do				105.0637429492446
the unhappy young man had not thought of this				297.15217602343813
as things are turning out i foresee that we must give battle to london to the provinces to all england and certainly in the end we can t fail to be beaten we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said athos				4.465241709329882
comminges knocked at the door at the same moment and friquet was waiting behind comminges until the door should be opened				730.0777917670168
i have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend i shall not meddle in politics well listen my dear aramis said d artagnan your philosophy convinces me on my honor				5119.863534549373
i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are no it is not worth while well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece all right he then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs				903.6673655608932
what is he contriving asked aramis				16.575752917554613
i will arm him against love alas madame exclaimed athos to day love is like war the breastplate is becoming useless raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day				154.70913747299946
but then young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty one who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation and have your notions changed asked dantès with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me no neither do i wish to incur guilt				76415142.65345123
if there were any danger to be apprehended on the road i am going i would request you to accompany me but as there is none remain where you are finish your bottles your game and your letter				352.64363401014134
the fact was that emery s son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed				9639693.944650915
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side				749.4030830886458
the boy undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour				579.545473063469
i am completely ignorant nor does it much disquiet me you re in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing what is your name bernajoux at your service well then monsieur bernajoux said d artagnan tranquilly i will wait for you at the door go monsieur i will follow you do not hurry yourself monsieur lest it be observed that we go out together				650.7261256365339

alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father s love				864.8920603646958
this is what i propose to do said athos				3.978851648087785
he then began to visit his friends of both sexes in that strange costume				1594.5140879428457
are you afraid that the holy spirit will come as a tongue of fire to open the doors of my prison no my lord but i have already told you what that damned magician predicted and what was it that the day of pentecost would not pass without your highness being out of vincennes you believe in sorcerers then you fool i i mind them no more than that and he snapped his fingers but it is my lord giulio who cares about them as an italian he is superstitious the duke shrugged his shoulders				52.859403868639774
then turning to noirtier do you hope the assassin will be tried no then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine yes it is no news to you added d avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject				192.13729261436683
the pavilion at nine o clock d artagnan was at the hôtel des gardes he found planchet all ready				2688.5239085647067
as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended				406647.0594759539
i only know for a certainty that he fell and it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions the devil gentlemen said the cardinal three men placed hors de combat in a cabaret squabble				1840434.6303583973

he departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited you know not the subject of their conversation he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london was this woman english he called her milady it is he it must be he murmured tréville				216.18012760349788

oh yes with all my soul well then listen valentine said the count i have a favor to ask of you of me				49.697285198900296
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand				43.14504649486385
the abbé told me it was worth francs muttered caderousse				33.132928954107875
this is recent news sir continued she and i thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter i should not have heard till to morrow perhaps after to morrow the last of all paris madame said raoul the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian your guardian				1446669.2437540658
yes that first and other things afterward speak it is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps depends the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since i saw you madame bonacieux and i should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks yes particularly if you follow the instructions i am about to give you me yes you				53.45564646559867
it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening				3825.844885371604
then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis called olivain the lackey who had followed him from blois and made him pack the valise under his own eyes watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign				685712.8973089592
at another time added he i should have said give them besides two hundred francs over as a present but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own so do not think me mean on this account penelon turned to his companions and exchanged a few words with them				18.456611957994898
you have the window that is sufficient				12370.866578982635
ten minutes afterwards villefort reached his hotel ordered horses to be ready in two hours and asked to have his breakfast brought to him				6.011961815964941
do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count i shall do whatever they do at paris madame if i have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement are you fond of horses count i have passed a considerable part of my life in the east madame and you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two things the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first you see madame how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undertone				1297.2490357270729
you promised to obey me implicitly				22773.89079061526

milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for her to see who was coming				3466.3351325387407
i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it				12.76069256391081

i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife do you think so i am sure of it and you have heard his fortune mentioned nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing and what is your opinion i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression well and it is that my opinion is that all these old podestàs these ancient condottieri for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces my opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land very little at least i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca ah he has a palace said danglars laughing come that is something yes and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house				260.2875882673258
at your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly				14952.199294190461

hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you that is the reason of your being shut up in the bastile				1207.501021336573
he was dressed in violet tinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color				31530.88077852559
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders so they tell me monseigneur do you know why no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man				2.3947414716349136
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardes he whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governor s country house so it is said d artagnan i know him now				144.1149971607456

the king is with us and his generals are the duke of orleans and the prince de condé although i must add tis almost impossible now to know to which party any one belongs yes answered athos but his right place is in our ranks with the prince de conti de beaufort d elbeuf and de bouillon but sir supposing that the conference is broken off are you going to try to take charenton such are my orders sir since you command the cavalry pardon me i am commander in chief so much the better				845.8670258098699
now the mischief is out depend upon it the custom house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor dantès hidden treasures mercédès however paid no heed to this explanation of her lover s arrest				64246.72757179138
the lackeys followed				392.45022943276786
live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is summed up in these two words wait and hope your friend edmond dantès count of monte cristo during the perusal of this letter which informed valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother she became pale a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom and tears not the less painful because they were silent ran down her cheeks her happiness cost her very dear				28273.07621552182
have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds well it was that affair madame these men are the ones who saved her and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men do for i tell you you must not count on monsieur d artagnan it will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered and whatever mazarin may say once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to england i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave whitehall				8259.93266696557

it was more especially when this man was speaking in a manner half jesting half bitter that franz s ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet well pitched voice that had addressed him in the grotto of monte cristo and which he heard for the second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the colosseum				937.9311702764443
make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my happiness that my life or death are nothing to you				18.896189987801353

by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt				159459.7067341225
meanwhile morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence that the presence of m de villefort even would not have alarmed him				4.2336654171067165

their appearance although it was not quite at ease excited by its carelessness at once full of dignity and submission the admiration of d artagnan who beheld in these two men demigods and in their leader an olympian jupiter armed with all his thunders				5311156.102372349

but he stopped doubtless to reflect for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to lord de winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queen s carriage had left the court				801.0173188413308

albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young cavalcanti monte cristo was for an instant alone				596.0594010060541
arriving at the faubourg st antoine he turned round to look gaily at the bastille but as it was the bastille alone he looked at he did not observe milady who mounted upon a light chestnut horse designated him with her finger to two ill looking men who came close up to the ranks to take notice of him				7.773744178076067
the approach was not such as to prepossess people an ill smelling dark passage a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet				7510129.501880108
the company of m le chevalier dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted d artagnan				12261.854551091734
i will summon him hither it is useless he would not come up to your apartments perhaps but he will not make any difficulty at entering mine the count went to the window of the apartment that looked on to the street and whistled in a peculiar manner				202.04698915263984
ah here you are monsieur she said in her naturally calm voice but how pale you are				60.709580116921856
mademoiselle de villefort is in deep sorrow is she not said debray to franz				121.39646689648251
all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively desire of arriving at a certainty and he went into his friend s chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding evening but he found athos quite himself again that is to say the most shrewd and impenetrable of men				380.88636197898313
anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey				1421.602564829902
the halberds were for the audience in the rear the muskets are for us thirty forty fifty sixty five men said porthos counting the reinforcements				3487046.4921725043
morrel held out his hand to her				14.248650859742627
villefort becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his head he must inspire madame danglars with the terror he felt				8514.202484584766
hasty actions are generally bad ones				8237.418614547842
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast				11266784.57935407
falconers are declining				698871.3704261082
he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty				579.1937877698546
i will stop at the first posting house said danglars to himself				65.86576007137623
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy				4563.704526575325
the others withdrew				1025.9535407314859
his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one				413.0235999395837
these two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing d artagnan on the coach box of the royal coach				2925.81399710485
take it then but in exchange caderousse who touched the diamond withdrew his hand				34.10735740353769
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that d artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two				689.2147999444927
dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous				47856.39183203964
this evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate				360.76748381080967
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude				6572.8688869396365
but was it my father s ring				5235.247914872878
danglars feelings were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the banker threw himself down again on his goat skin and did not breathe another word				238.49368286265252
i faith said d artagnan to raoul you were just in time to stay my hand				53.76968000834104
the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery				2292.8890644852213
speak out are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror asked another				3745.622148592667

where am i to die said she				20.278680687810574
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting				1700.995009360759
it was then richelieu s object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to avenge himself on a rival but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom				1493.6236670967248
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal				2419362.5726273227
sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead				1840427.609670836
the king was a few steps behind me when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow				1465.1290418835645
in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment				385.89487034062597

de winter followed his look observed his feelings and guessed all				77.79174946105557
thin and lanky the executioner said d artagnan and aramis at the same time				56.638085752349056
the praise was well deserved for had not the count heard it from the baroness or by one of those means by which he knew everything the baron s countenance would not have led him to suspect it				6.648352804182439
one would have thought the king was going to bed and not to his coffin				3095438.9895869917
danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dantès and when napoleon returned to france he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of providence				588.2084513628191
i am at least fearful of it				13.37862399324588
no said villefort burying his face in his hands no a hundred times no then you did not bury the poor child there sir				414.6909446833867
he meditates				736788.750434322

if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after you how so i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majesty s ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor d artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues				43059.479239108805
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the attention paid him by the count				238.30565975516893
in the most simple and natural manner possible				570.2419548010465
nothing at all that s a capital arrangement				260516.33313959345
i will give them to you on condition that you let me go why do you offer me for what is worth				38046.96132084067
one evening i was in a garden a clump of trees concealed me no one suspected i was there				277.89571099860774
are you fond of traveling my life has been passed on the high road would anything retain you particularly in paris nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in paris very well				114.61925074569002
this morning being ignorant that i should have the honor of seeing your majesty i encumbered myself with this dress but you will find me none the less a man devoted to your majesty s service in whatever way you may see fit to use me the abbé d herblay resumed de winter is one of those gallant musketeers formerly belonging to his majesty king louis xiii of whom i have spoken to you madame then turning to athos he continued and this gentleman is that noble comte de la fere whose high reputation is so well known to your majesty gentlemen said the queen a few years ago i had around me ushers treasures armies and by the lifting of a finger all these were busied in my service				591.3993974667007
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels				4909155.044377406
this something was enveloped in a cloak and d artagnan at first believed it was a man but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a woman				635.9749573422706
i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet oh answered another voice which d artagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis				138.08044058867804
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them				17.0568910437355
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance				3011.736272218937
will you eat any of these beans cousin porthos said mme				32.515793695845495
i want air that is all will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase				1035.4325085186929
oh yes tired enough he has done nothing the whole of this blessed day				413.45060032692396
presently it sounded one o clock				6.456602462090773
it was true that this order would not be of great use to them while they were in camp at la rochelle that is to say at the other end of france				181.45390311774779
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queen s army				1169.2406526320478
what has been the result that thanks to my pretended ignorance there is none of your friends from m de villefort to m debray who has not trembled before me				12.55989144663661
once beyond saint denis we shall have nothing to fear grimaud in fact brought back five horses				407.7430853623954
you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young man eagerly				666.4750576677706
at length with a violent effort at self control the name of that woman he said				23.343946409124218
d artagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes and saw her go toward the terrace but it happened that someone in the house called lubin so that planchet remained alone looking in all directions for the road where d artagnan had disappeared				144.1628337907325
and why so asked porthos warmly				482.5123790625358

when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landing place passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return				1433.603155450926
the abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind				134.9556663652078
i might have suspected he was poisoning us and you see you would have been deceived yes doubtless but believe me that man has other projects				806429.9487634093

upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure				3200333.201029147
the former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear for it was the second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of god s anger ah indeed said monte cristo looking earnestly at the young man and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair so that he remained in the shade while the light fell full on maximilian s face				119.99319763244894
dantès went and cut the strongest olive tree he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever				601.4423072373947

he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask				868.1612324104925
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils				2739301.660010733

although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress she did at last so decide which was all d artagnan wished				2822.4044658224975
his insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor which he had climbed four steps at a time				163.7965621503261
kitty fearing she was ill hastened toward her and was beginning to open her dress but milady started up pushing her away				4261.055370488467

pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called me well said albert				41.62978072638393
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madame thanks for your punctuality and he offered a chair to madame danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated				333974.3986341636

mazarin especially yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreigner well he would be more justly estimated				4387748.495162713
this time danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speaker s meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide				4548339.023775287

when the two musketeers had entered when the door was closed behind them when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food had recommenced when m de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on parade he stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday evening do you know gentlemen no replied the two musketeers after a moment s silence no sir we do not but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow				762.548277381095

oh sir				11.73627965960229
why if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of flattering attention her reputation would be gone forever and the very reason why the women of this fine country where sounds the si as dante writes put so little restraint on their words and actions is because they live so much in public and have really nothing to conceal				9343.186582814025

no kitty you are mistaken				219.19802561238532
i think the arm will make up for the sword halt cried porthos coming forward				348.5714435236622

come come said comminges who since d artagnan on the day of broussel s arrest had saved him from the hands of the parisians had entertained a real affection for him don t be unhappy i never thought of bringing you bad news				48718.7588789953
the box taken by albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobility s boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants				2920343.48630214
the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the best apartment in the house which d artagnan occupied with authority				29481.134037678752
ali bring me some water the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting				4502106.523802878
after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl a piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst				3414797.297216458
half past one only said he				11.219620220214063
d avrigny and villefort laid him on a couch				668265.1467172209

it appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers				29649.065844063975
you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal yes and the queen too the queen do you say to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarin s hands that famous diamond you remember all about it that i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which i don t know how she has regained possession but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you so i think replied d artagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos and you to whom are you devoted now to the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover i have answered for your devotion also and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf magnificent my dear fellow magnificent				1704682.3577283921
between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fan shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub tropical sun				1948.3897275375723
she calculated that to cross this corner of france and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days				577.5024432871485
well be it so at length said eugénie return by the same road you came and we will say nothing about you unhappy wretch here he is here he is cried a voice from the landing here he is				136.18520624779907
buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand and then rising said within six months if i am not dead i shall have seen you again madame even if i have to overturn the world and faithful to the promise he had made he rushed out of the apartment				133.56159019846504
your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not he said turning to d artagnan				1.0444346673350626
i do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept secret mordaunt followed bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out				3740.028842566143
well let us pledge the ring but upon one condition what that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for me don t dream it athos				583.1716894489883
the stranger touched his mule with his heel and continued his way				357.31398409059886
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about her you are right said d artagnan i will have done with her				30.238805301933322
how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpent like forehead round vulture shaped head and sharp hooked nose like the beak of a buzzard				5305126.9772595735
haydée s only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girl s picturesque attitude and appearance				11707.498017578779
she is not to leave this chamber understand john continued the baron				2019.2891298258617
the sergeant with the air of importance which such people assume when they are clad with military dignity said who are you gentlemen two gentlemen and where do you come from from london and what are you going to do in paris we are going with a mission to her majesty the queen of england ah every one seems to be going to see the queen of england				473.109804806695
the affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm				393.3056180221988
comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when d artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal				90.74958022402306
he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust				1202562.9967320566
i knew very well that they tired out their executioners but i did not believe them so strong against their lovers alas				1095.9650760822608
the interests of the french crown endangered at this moment are to discountenance rebellion in a neighboring nation				21747.459724339333
he was on villefort s premises had arrived there by scaling the wall				125.30902548579238
debray had told you ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now then you are wrong madame				263.53478519634547
the young girl perfectly understood the look and so did villefort for his countenance became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily				2384331.0688824
we were all so happy in the chateau de pierrefonds and without any other complaint passive and obedient either from true devotion to his master or from the example set by blaisois mousqueton leaped into the sea headforemost				2110294.0910117025
what are you eating there porthos i am dipping a biscuit in a glass of spanish wine do the same you are right				216.33305333816267
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk				5952.533399392846
that man is cromwell said he				11.379670782979758
if i am an officer your fortune is certain for i shall have money enough for both and moreover a name we shall both be proud of since it will be our own				458.88512908760026
at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door again				254.37165973957318
mazarin did not even turn around				1175.8908428042344
madame replied the president bowing with profound respect allow me to ask one question it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated i can sir said haydée drawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my father and his principal officers and that of my baptism my father having consented to my being brought up in my mother s faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french officer who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his part of the booty the wife and daughter of his benefactor whom he sold for the sum of four hundred thousand francs a greenish pallor spread over the count s cheeks and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence				303.2167739095657
but since our resolution is formed let us act promptly				3010259.1685738172
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide				15275538.340844747
you are a lieutenant				9258.637932900612
yes he has entered it is for you or me my god how agitated you seem yes i admit it				7.620887623730905
the young count s conversation was most interesting to raoul therefore he listened much whilst the count talked well and long				906.8781063902585
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence				1485.0944078185682
this charge was so fierce so skillfully conducted that chanleu was almost surrounded				16179.67581368615
he esteems me highly				3330029.5806495566
but what is the matter with my hands asked milady it seems as if my wrists had been crushed in a vice milady held out her arms her wrists were bruised				5080207.451547444
morrel did not turn round he expected these words of cocles the agent of thomson french he placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth				1166.5269269950284
dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror				198.3037938242402
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines god knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc d angoulême themselves watched over by the cardinal an inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days				733.0390415569294
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count s chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honoré				308.1518643910652
gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach				389072.8770938676
i have corrected the vices that i had i have assumed the virtues that i had not				91.53345733000026
with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over				1393.5566326735077
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head				32.592011150700586
besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures				147899.9266793638
has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command				8029.098711060717
we must explain this visit which although expected by monte cristo is unexpected to our readers				1856764.8419980605
they were approaching the scene of war and as bands of spaniards sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions even as far as the neighborhood of arras they determined to remain in the town until the morrow				897.5298488342773
franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering				3385655.2545917807
nobody knows you				10.918020869271077
then it is for to day asked the king				18.996502346292505
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not move				858.8385061015969
d artagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side				1199.0694892030333
take care of the executioner d artagnan all right				807.0565234567918

descend my lord said the man in the moat				38690.62435115091
it was a strange thing that no one ever appeared to advance a step in that man s favor				268.3911344750816
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes watering pots hung against the wall this was all the furniture				1142.6879866685306
the two combatants had been seen in a position which left no doubt of their intentions				2497.058764403678
he addressed about twelve words to him grimaud answered in four				55460.25182066387
the cardinal writes better than i thought				23682.206109036648
at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten				61211.65057247534
the three friends were likewise greatly delighted				3187628.279210308

he urged the horse again into a trot				14495.29232387743
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for d artagnan				1.0655812014478891
the galley slaves breathed the fresh air of heaven and saw each other				59.575789733663115

ah ah cried one of the guards will you persist in saying most discreet aramis that you are not on good terms with madame de bois tracy when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs aramis darted at d artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy				2628.6799014515414
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by d artagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them				43.89902284746532
d artagnan preferred the second means and lifted the assassin onto his shoulders at the moment the enemy fired				7815.590271369853
the accusation no the letter are you sure i saw it done that alters the case				35200.84405982491

it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses				588.8929391748427
milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction				7063.376880597207
and what is a fronde inquired mazarin				45.668596454455155

d artagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of porthos went straight to harrison who recognized him as having met him at cromwell s and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could				3629.239123454473

at last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep				1310.9518541222715
my own service said d artagnan				1.0343543308522087

i shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign i shall begin to exterminate bravo thought d artagnan on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos				66.76920492042562
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dantès listening ears mingled with brutal laughter				1918.6822144767589
do you know the decision we have come to mother have we come to any yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i will earn for myself the right to use the name i now bear instead of the one i have thrown aside mercédès sighed				289.8703035338222

thank you sir answered the young man much moved				4033.3551780509815
the report of spanish cruelty had gone out and every one was frightened				1442.5546388482626
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal				159329.129839695
d artagnan hits on a plan				1915.740327260623
at the sight of him she expected though probably not in such a costume the young woman started in terror and was about to make a hasty retreat				2612.2946619603176
it was therefore necessary before everything else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear that i should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection				13436.40374228787
the traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of thomson french which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in rome				367.3429117933222
it was indeed strange in this unknown spot to find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in paris				225.56205600837094

and this room he asked pointing to the captain s cabin				50168.32802208071
he was then only fifteen feet from the ground as the gentlemen below had told him				34.308307157247
for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room				102.8756115096125

what orders asked milady				38.209622702038075
in short what shall i say to you felton continued milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime				3577.7227217497743
he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one				203.5260468597491
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met				12488.765542583928

marshal de grammont was to hold the extreme left resting on mericourt				1962859.6770098251
but in france they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance				1934.964755080162
i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to something noirtier did not lose a word of what valentine said				108.31713529425076
everything count said albert in a low tone to monte cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her history				4127.4247140654425
he appeared calm but it was evidently not without a mighty effort				9429.262654927777
the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example				1230.7228050470494
i know you gentlemen said the cardinal i know you				24.814275325490375
i have my sword and no one waiting for you outside no then you had better come with me thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it				4.539025581667645
a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot the day began to decline carriages were passing and repassing				12211261.850438686
the result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind				422.82785000350367
cocles went first and the stranger followed him				10.097513828744166
d artagnan followed them				166.10495986030082
edmond resigned the lugger to the master s care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment				381.91281021194453
and you tell me this magistrate expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you he did and the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter yes and then made you swear never to utter the name of noirtier yes why you poor short sighted simpleton can you not guess who this noirtier was whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed				3394976.729475527
how is that you asked me for five hundred men did you not				39.7832863905611
d artagnan owned nothing				207.39916532159134
at last he made his way through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel				920.3629162158245
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothing without reckoning mousqueton s wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more ay ay said athos exchanging a smile with d artagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good master in short said porthos when all my expenses are paid i shall have at most thirty crowns left and i about ten pistoles said aramis				17.260268962412606
have pity on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself as dantès his eyes turned in the direction of the château d if uttered this prayer he saw off the farther point of the island of pomègue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey and with his sailor s eye he knew it to be a genoese tartan				9736.283284408957
what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure				47779.824576522566
i have not and i can not make three copies of that letter because it is sealed				3293362.3316749716
at the voice of this last speaker grimaud started and felt a shudder creeping through his very marrow				4049159.0493674865
scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent				2165265.843440816
i have particular business to settle with this gentleman and i shall and will begin porthos and aramis drew back disappointed and drawing his sword d artagnan turned to his adversary sir i am waiting for you and for my part gentlemen i admire you				11.085693288613772
hide thy diamonds bury thy gold shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty liberty for a prison a living body for a corpse as he thus reasoned monte cristo walked down the rue de la caisserie				11113709.929907816
i know a clever person at tours aramis stopped on seeing athos smile				821.6364225630963
you know the rest milady knew that lord de winter lied and she was the more alarmed				2367.002381841596
let us save ourselves at these words she passed her arm under that of d artagnan and urged him forward eagerly				497.4061286786711
you will not abandon me				3.6271449742482913
the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other				75.78348421316912
and do you never use your eyes which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a glance the kind of man by whom you are confronted				4966624.72508248
and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own				232.1942111816306
yes yes replied dantès eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé				14.351590867133753
when they entered the port it was already night				1398.9755032480723
oh sir said villefort arresting maximilian by the arm if my father the inflexible man makes this request it is because he knows be assured that valentine will be terribly revenged				27120.6763667038
not at all i assure you but where will you manage to stow me in the chamber overhead surely that is where you yourselves sleep never mind that we have a second bed in the adjoining room caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment				3694.3698482751456
mazarin sent us to cromwell				893.8350580337792
some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren				260332.54667344072
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter				3975.4881796225222
the cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the rochellais how unjust selfish and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders				1370606.6466510405
and moreover my dear child continued d artagnan i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian i do not understand you sir said raoul				74.55483400712498
and is he still in love with the catalane over head and ears but unless i am much mistaken there will be a storm in that quarter explain yourself why should i it is more important than you think perhaps				3506.0782349510123
get up he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos				2466.012051183793
consult some politician of the period of which you speak and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to know all you want eh pardieu said mazarin with a grimace which he always made when spoken to about money				1509.3676796133122
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground				43.92851643792357
adieu brother cried milady				53.27887561643054
the three musketeers possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about d artagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from d artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent				890.4560451415298
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dantès the features of his conductor an under jailer ill clothed and of sullen appearance				755.6020428013701
but what are you about there				237.06869077247958
yes he s not a man to allow himself to be taken anyhow he ll defend himself well we must try to take him alive				68062.35506075989
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same				467.53369823519154
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy				2137.360482178198
your honor cried planchet i ve a man behind me d artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on planchet s horse				257.96318161731074
as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of m de la trémouille in whose service he had a relative d artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror				8092107.216456514
that is doubtless our boat said athos				3.620000731484763
at last d artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and d artagnan s blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass				20099.344815124165
we will do the same the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with d artagnan				1.064634087189886
end of the port wine mystery				135453.19759973403
now for the wager				4111563.1819460234
by degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will that is to say beauty meekness and tears and above all the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness the most devouring of all voluptuousness				14128264.124053339
where were we i recollect you were saying said d artagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france				143.43525257964245
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at half past two o clock the mayor of marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall				1521.610605933904
ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi barefooted and out at elbows with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully curved above the head stared at the traveller the post chaise and the horses to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the papal states who earned a pittance by diving into the tiber at high water from the bridge of st angelo				120873.67814741602
go then said the duke and return as soon as possible does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent				7231.128293051771
as i told you it is an old family jewel and you sold it asked d artagnan hesitatingly				2635.562829032179
but that is not all				88.29237608396693
mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole				1583406.7646104596
all hands to the pumps i shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in				196.48521688662404
every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine o clock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest s breviary				12644.63445892419
cardinal mazarin said he				18.351198946488054
therefore when i cough stretch out your arm good the two friends then placed themselves as they had agreed porthos being completely hidden in an angle of the window				60.6332617635854
yes sir continued the inspector of prisons				1032512.3545979203

eugénie she said to herself is lost and so are we				6028.6648860349305
on the of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month and that morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk emmanuel and his cashier cocles to meet the creditors				5793662.245322348
he went to desire you to come to the palace				657.315702839203
very good said the count				8.606757046907585
they reached the rue st honoré and in the place du palais cardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades				10108.060050954711
my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friend s arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen s service yes it s true				790.5029675868697
luigi slowly relinquished teresa s arm which he had held beneath his own and teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille				2341395.9242083556
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone				329.35032492410704
at the first word you dared to utter at the first freedom to which i had to reply i called for help yes yes that is true				277.9216843685429
i was not willing to fly				6443.838909659564
he touched him on the shoulder				243.0634140432466
i felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of america thus feels the approach of the serpent				26361.82556160257
de chevreuse and consequently the queen				198.37973893287133
the noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant				353702.26712471247
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to sea rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves				2249.46284595904
the old patron who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and fréjus urged dantès to try and rise				4936.786396736144
can t you guess my dear athos				62.520334010157704
after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth yes said the count yes i raised the stones and found a rope ladder and some tools how do you know that asked the guide in astonishment				308.74061996651193
during this time madame morrel had told her son everything				1692.7959810592467
your hand madame your hand and i depart anne of austria stretched forth her hand closing her eyes and leaning with the other upon estafania for she felt that her strength was about to fail her				24.43029953809326
what chance brings you here gentlemen said château renaud shaking hands with each of them				410.4545974884886
yes i think i saw him pass but pray call emmanuel excuse me madame but i must go up to maximilian s room this instant replied monte cristo i have something of the greatest importance to tell him go then she said with a charming smile which accompanied him until he had disappeared				263.9696869228997
they entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder				4680.657214538846
he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried				21147959.591671553
will your excellency deign to open it said the delighted bertuccio and you will find gloves in it elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling bottles cigars knick knacks				1432109.0492720006
am i to say what you told me asked valentine				165.95857432531432
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didn t mean mischief that s my opinion too said the captain and i ll take precautions accordingly				35805.16633979988
just so then you are called monsieur grimaud the traveler made a sign of assent				1406.2562545588748
tell me his name edmond dantès villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five and twenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch				2086884.301654903
let our readers reassure themselves				1282.0188603444549
you are the friend of the cardinal for he sends you hither and yet and yet i speak ill of him replied milady finishing the thought of the superior				3165275.1636283225
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man				55.74598327617399
i do in that case i will go and the two carriages passed on towards their different destinations				4707690.221037935
i have just made m de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned				1194.301360721271
do not exaggerate your duty				914.1843662274522
and the duke furious against the cardinal				50.14641533192441
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious father				157.32261786362398
aramis stopped				3583.1382201441043

porthos drew back a step				261.79559057751607
he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile				196.45598732780124

master broussel is being killed				68.04002339011117

the count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged				14691210.290228983
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours grimaud bowed in thanks				19241.125521701266

he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when d artagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand				15.498365661602536
it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him				18.911982814190797
yes dead alas				792.8638763104923

i then perceived that he was hiding something under his mantle which he laid on the grass in order to dig more freely				39903.87613925655
then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned but this proved useless for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six months				1730.7296321860376

pardieu beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed				14696.793177505893

the marshal was ordinarily very adventurous and was wont to hesitate at nothing and he had that lofty contempt for the populace which army officers usually profess				22706458.16448156

the carriage was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car				2033406.00158309

the name of d artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year or that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty				324026.7868029523

seeing d artagnan about to leave her milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the comte de wardes				128.49736443093815

yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest				3288729.7793603325

d artagnan				1.0873181852241476
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller				1840.3194934358173
and yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the duke of buckingham				203.19567009523814
the price of his blood she murmured				439.36939243018344
but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention and so he was murmured caderousse				58.998008032978674
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello				10795.197640525686

there monsieur there is that letter cried the queen with a broken and trembling voice take it and deliver me from your odious presence the chancellor who on his part trembled with an emotion easily to be conceived took the letter bowed to the ground and retired				855.8076401252526
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg of you monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m villefort entered				34.140714197809665
yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit				4311.747974161682

the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale				221.16891590333006
monte cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his hand at the same time she seized that of her son and joined them together				960.5275475276494

one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and pastrini s account of vampa s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them				61.68764476510873
i am monsieur d artagnan a gascon gentleman serving in the king s musketeers				568.4268424177383

like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position				3649.076861084725
a deep silence reigned for a long time in the boat after the fearful scene described				150791.82315092007

there was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly				2951.9831203085837
however jacopo insisted on following him and dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust				46711.301162802156

excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously				1729376.874182652
it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down				455.2278719070497
the queen might be as much injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence and let us admit it the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young protector decided her to speak				599.6013573033351
why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest mother				1372.4736885527795
d artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal				31.85281025714054

whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery				1176.6098907908731
when i am convinced that the statement is false what the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly but what is there to investigate sir said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamp s last remark				112975.99151557166
he didn t predict the future he knew the past often a more dangerous thing mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place				222.59108308158326
go to				228.1659605376945
but continued m de tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as i have said i will do something for you young man				30.776396147782755
look at these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his lips and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards				398020.0044621574

the vendetta at what point shall i begin my story your excellency asked bertuccio				195.27658212965125
the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franz s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened				1152.7918980535237
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water				3893.445547492614

he had his foot upon it that is all and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his and you were deceived my dear sir replied aramis coldly very little sensible to the reparation				1853272.6717170493
still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure				240.94957262404296

the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom				133750.8240263027

if he demands my daughter let him fix the day declare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or quarrel				17828.238874227318
how very astonishing cried he at length				30840.383923751528
i was blind athos has made me see that s all come here the two friends went near him				10.740099321533846
what are you meddling with stupid				71879234.53249408
i have one but not one from cardinal mazarin enter and ask for monsieur bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room				57.14284360109353
raoul had only been at m scarron s house he named to guiche the people whom he had seen there				281.9921071526627
d artagnan who foreseeing such an event had kept his eye on him sprang toward him caught him in his arms and assisted him to his chamber				166.1433787358761
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur				62728.116544743396
do i turn to the right or to the left hand to the right said caderousse				32.26408453213661
wretch exclaimed aramis raising his pistol as he passed by him but the powder flashed in the pan and it did not go off				339.3267219086024
no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his hands into his pockets				152302.4025545807
then tis i who am mistaken for you have always been a good chronologist				1345130.2669342645
my prisoner he cried				30.189187067549632
so if i do not send you more it is because i fear you would not accept a larger sum				2391.8692585502904
if they do not bring us peace we will give them war if they do not bring life we will give them death and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made one think of dionysus of old crete but i being only a little child was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and i recoiled with horror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which probably awaited us				75.90503596697673
gaetano was not mistaken				390.46508802255295
yes the porter my lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house well the house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise by whom by thieves you are a fool m baptistin				1603.5624241391681
at his mother s ball he danced once with eugénie and m cavalcanti three times and he took no notice of it the valet announced the vicomte albert de morcerf				68.99036294593105
i confess this staggers me and it has staggered everybody				116249.73192855912
quite certain said milady with a last doubt				2218.198385437498
on his side d artagnan became more cautious also				519.2052664732274
are you indisposed or have you forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme				44.475164618028565
but when he was alone with the hostess he said now pretty madeleine you know the difference between a swiss and a gentleman				477.9235392113812
i fear an attack myself after all these disasters oh man murmured d avrigny the most selfish of all animals the most personal of all creatures who believes the earth turns the sun shines and death strikes for him alone an ant cursing god from the top of a blade of grass				1765008.4546590908
diable he said after having swallowed the divine preserve				170595.16435794366
have you really measured the world by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles				1851604.9794055505
there said the king that consoles me they are not all traitors at this moment winter s voice was raised with the cry of forward the first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the plateau				10977047.527312832
d avrigny continued to look at noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead				461.8816745210494
the guards were under arms and d artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades				6220.153891076637
d artagnan remained all day in his quarters assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad				26108.676329253252
why do we hate				7223.03675367254
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty anne hesitated				1071.5913876256518
did you know him				29.014320165323724
neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other				156.92463038103244
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states				202.48341421029943
ah if you laugh if you doubt me replied aramis you shall know nothing we believe like mohammedans and are as mute as tombstones said athos				4.301381346340918
repudiated by her husband said athos				4.061219013339377
chapter lv				4349.38811534562
that night brought together all those comrades of the guards of m dessessart and the company of musketeers of m de tréville who had been accustomed to associate together				614.9032387388015
it contained my fortune bills upon spain asked the disturbed host				2357.0009401667503
on entering the banker s mansion they perceived the phaeton and servant of m andrea cavalcanti				302.21530050631014
but how can that be				570.5661666951328
at the outer door the steward paused				1536.8088634456444
in a quarter of an hour we set off that s the advice i was about to give monsieur and where are we going may i ask without being too curious pardieu in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone				259.6819930943356
he walked straight into the midst of the guards who on seeing him were silent				303.3605254889253
monsieur du tremblay received d artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake				2090290.3337610778
so in twelve times you thrice missed the mark which you sir struck twelve times answered raoul smiling				18.020667759870676
and now let us see young man with your hand upon your conscience how did all this come to pass d artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its details how not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the expectation of seeing his majesty he had gone to his three friends three hours before the hour of audience how they had gone together to the tennis court and how upon the fear he had manifested lest he receive a ball in the face he had been jeered at by bernajoux who had nearly paid for his jeer with his life and m de la trémouille who had nothing to do with the matter with the loss of his hôtel				24139.14142841516
it was too late for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the pope s butler				1634012.2842351994
and such magnificent hair				3166.758869986484
yes since she lives at that moment d avrigny s glance met noirtier s eye				706.521249712423
valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it				31.261158210865197
are you not going to put up at the arms of england yes sir are you not charged with a mission from his eminence cardinal mazarin yes sir in that case i am the man you have to do with				456.8930115454584
blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor				1093.2509386606223
none on my word				187.22654515100186
he accustomed himself to speaking to the new jailer although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old one but still to speak to a man even though mute was something				8003.129476821988
all i ask is permission to remain abed would you like to have a physician called said the woman				1158.3958632092783
this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that instead of being the result of the power of his will it might emanate from enfeebled organs				549298.4982876539
that reply led to several questions about the king s capture and athos gave details so precise and positive that if the gatekeepers had any suspicions they vanished completely				57055.91294808486
he would not				71.209547771977
at eleven o clock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved court and the rue du faubourg saint honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess				5436.097584759871
what i think of is that we have crossed swords as enemies				4684.055416481007
believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like glass still edmond still she must have admired you				21.907586671394895
it is edmond and mercédès ah see there now said caderousse and i did not recognize them				27.218383594663667
it is true that the indulgence of his foster mother encouraged him				11.113880030485616
he waited then in the ante chamber with impatience till he should be conducted to them				18.515777546975865
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate				3532877.9050507154
oh no sir from my childhood i have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for misfortune to have an undue power over me				13.348250993391131
at length villefort the most composed of all spoke sir said he to maximilian you say you loved valentine that you were betrothed to her				35.66518915589298
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone				546.2849031300461
i address you because you know that although i esteem him from my heart i am a little awed by the comte de la fere but it is understood that what i offer you i offer him at the same time				56.46340340595847
but once started he could not stop				2098.2231561718218
how can a young man live upon francs a month but you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands more do not advance it the father will never repay it				5.581854370705259
he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pocket handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu				15023.910766357045
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard d artagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal				7807943.7179248
he entered with a tolerably dignified step and some little haste				4844.93526582128
you have not seen all yet continued faria for i did not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding place				107.50136937035073
all is ready sire said he				9.875535332186102
you know wine is a deceiver but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand				203.7629836965761
come now he said				2.3139811185288033

on being left alone with mme				25.77745505047824
if you have it use it replied gondy				216.92525369544782
bonacieux had disappeared without his being able to discover what had become of her				25.98235565079158
as to monsieur who had begun the siege he left to the cardinal the task of finishing it				131.73277668932255
fortunately the day after tomorrow we leave paris				497.70506744643814
are you ambitious				128509.93819757107
however that might have been the priest dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him				8.281607043101449
valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed hour for visiting her she had gone to the spot simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy				3850169.0889668628
at the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many voices so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed				3124734.0501576583
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i will pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me ah said the captain we can agree very well if you are reasonable give me what you give the others and it will be all right returned dantès				106.1971750572413
then he began to search				90889.46768793989
i have a son				622.7905711818763
i thank you equally for the service you have rendered me in being my seconds				476660.23083446675
at this moment planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont				2169407.977006783
and he is dead yes well sir said d arminges it is the common lot even an executioner is not exempted				3176881.9388091923
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands daume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusement s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project				3588.4421366486686
at thirty five which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of france or england				6025.50355462435
yes had i died years ago but now to die would be indeed to give way to the sarcasm of destiny				21592.464736995535
i know them by their romantic imagination				10877.717836386577
every time i see you is a fresh diamond which i enclose in the casket of my heart				32.451512653420664
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner				116.91040265675204
the three young people were talking together				597.6563131221976
my dear friends said d artagnan give your swords to monsieur mouston who will return them to you at the proper time and place and do not forget you are our prisoners it was not long before they joined the escort				208990.85549288854
if she said there is one among you who knows the king let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there a man wrapped in a cloak in the folds of which his face was hidden approached and leaned over the bed and looked				2470955.9588954877
i have not seen you consequently i know nothing of your dinner how foolish you are				33.698567850307064
higher monsieur higher of madame d aiguillon still higher of madame de chevreuse higher much higher of the d artagnan checked himself				69.2375004073049
that admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king charles i whom heaven protect from evil came into france i would offer him my house my own house but alas				1086.0671145344613
as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the jailer delivers to him				23.670067451725046
in the meanwhile franz was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the count of monte cristo at the moment when he had been in some sort forced to give his hand to albert				341.39730390200214
coquenard was in the dilemma of harpagan				2908941.500884293
he opened the window a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in half the poplars which stood out in black relief on the horizon				462.6344148440014
d artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance ah said bonacieux they took good care not to tell me that and my wife on her part has sworn to me by all that s sacred that she does not know				192.65122388583984
sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction				716.1685050835
trembling his hair erect his brow bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his heart				40.61816125586435
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls				2154.124008205142
there are no unimportant events in this world and we shall see that this apparently slight incident came near endangering the monarchy				4881172.778345307
the villefort vault formed a square of white stones about twenty feet high an interior partition separated the two families and each apartment had its entrance door				701.2550821627561

his brain was on fire and life and energy returned				5700.970620549318
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere				235725.06111714896
awakened in the night by the light of the flames she sprang out of bed wrapped herself in a dressing gown and attempted to escape by the door but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames				30266.786764287943
what do you mean grimaud he exclaimed				97.44076097876307
the palikares who were prostrated at my father s feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke				31060.399687033303
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name edmond dantès				249.7480224526104
the contract three days after the scene we have just described namely towards five o clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between mademoiselle eugénie danglars and andrea cavalcanti whom the banker persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the count of monte cristo s house and the count was preparing to go out				49.531998003237874
in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use a sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open				600.0418238064524

the aperture was finished and athos passed through it carrying the clothes destined for the king wrapped in black cloth and the tools with which he was to open a communication with the king s room				78.39825145973089
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion				80477.84970026308
valentine rushed towards him his lips again moved				277104.5826355655

but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis				140.20353765709595
if she had been a great lady she would have fainted but as she was only a procurator s wife she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury eh monsieur porthos you don t offer me any holy water porthos at the sound of that voice started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years				359.6266857012262

do you hear baron				7330919.177991381
the queen was still standing when he entered but scarcely had she perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair and made a sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools and with an air of supreme hauteur said what do you desire monsieur and with what object do you present yourself here to make madame in the name of the king and without prejudice to the respect which i have the honor to owe to your majesty a close examination into all your papers how monsieur an investigation of my papers mine				818.6712585474615

why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear planchet and no one could find fault with it ah monsieur replied planchet recurring to his besetting idea that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips what the devil makes you think of bonacieux monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we will because you are a coward planchet monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a virtue and you are very virtuous are you not planchet monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder				12659.294469361224

i am the friend of the great cardinal of the great cardinal perhaps you would contest his right to that title madame i would contest nothing but i tell you that the favor of a minister is ephemeral and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a minister				323.7746967571779

they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying				2337518.30776784
at the dawn of day he replaced the stone pushed his bed against the wall and lay down				116.48165838654779
the door was wide open a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yard a strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment				162.8894805758151
oh fear nothing madame said the young woman clasping her hands and weeping herself at the queen s sorrows i am your majesty s body and soul and however far i may be from you however inferior may be my position i believe i have discovered a means of extricating your majesty from your trouble you oh heaven you cried the queen but look me in the face				242.00083888725854
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier				1815.8980240778503
now one evening when d artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them				11.103519019602375
give him a direct invitation but do not ask me to present him				21.661494797244572
his mouth was large and the lips which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in fact the deep and crafty look giving a predominant expression to the child s face belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young				4311.073658353935
you a queen to quarrel like a washerwoman				1291794.2996707694

well baron i promise you some good exercise said the gascon				49.7700067747544
no and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over you he should have occupied my place he should have emptied that glass he should have risen against the assassin				11709.954606113284
and who told you i had no affair with a lover it is a man then who expects you cried d artagnan				1.0369398606175024
well said the jailer are you more reasonable today dantès made no reply				707.9514695434129
all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and strength which i am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yours you shall now see me prove mine one instant my dear friend replied the abbé it is clear you do not understand the nature of the courage with which i am endowed and what use i intend making of my strength				1833.3755476465158
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning				2551.3976631287364
oh my dear friend if this be the case if you can no longer weep if your frozen heart be dead if you put all your trust in god then maximilian you are consoled do not complain count said morrel in a firm and at the same time soft voice listen to me as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven though he remains on earth i come to die in the arms of a friend				984.5847909718174
the rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion				18302.441990554165

de saint méran had always expressed a desire in case his death happened during his absence from paris that his body might be brought to the family vault				1268167.3944286657
dantès dived again and remained a long time beneath the water				1169.3778148745432
in truth said porthos i understand but now about the middle of the rue des petits champs they were stopped by a second patrol				33387.709952402765
the chances of war said athos are many but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them no but we shall make use of them said d artagnan				1.0352005968101072

a table which had been covered with an elegant supper was overturned				17546826.797185063
bonacieux had not been abed				20728006.345856696
for an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters but the weight dragged him down he disappeared by degrees soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk				11620218.826707747
what were you saying to this youngster my lord replied guitant i was observing that we live in troublous times and that to day s events are very like those in the days of the ligue of which i heard so much in my youth				61634.34439787392

give me those papers and leave us the officer took from the table the papers pointed out gave them to him who asked for them bowed to the ground and retired				712.113836619524
being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard				12439359.915151332
and now eat and drink i will entertain you tonight				209639.21545118318

but such is man we always want something more than we already have what does porthos wish for to be a baron ah true				977.4329117099604

without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that d artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos				146.9770330283469
you are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her friend				127.59950651277714
does this oath satisfy you yes said they all with one accord				631005.6617438196
my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen and he as usual has refused				10861.598532321761
ignorant of their real enemies they do not perceive that it is not the italian who speaks french badly but those who can say fine things to them in the purest parisian accent who are their real foes				2025.6975623288145
yes yes continued lord de winter i understand				332.8336903035263
you receive francs per annum for your services here more than many a brave subaltern who continually risks his life for his country obtains				1334741.2981425151
porthos abated no doubt of his too great confidence by his adventure of chantilly played with skill and prudence				129053.27409355761
here we are without occupation it seems to me you forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of charenton i hope to see monsieur de chatillon whom i ve hated for a long time there why have you hated him because he is the brother of coligny ah true				599.4395528296927

he had just expired with clenched hands his mouth in a spasm of agony and his hair on end in the sweat of death				139.6208467884231

in the room of the english nebuchadnezzar replied the staunch puritan				14545.975790495368
i dare not say more in a letter				278.0635205722089
but said porthos i think i have an idea in my turn silence for monsieur porthos s idea said aramis				17.533516617936264
out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away				547.5048305011378
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose				18493.07179729912
dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it				6.327228736042031
but i wonder she is not here				135.25639549308517

terror recalled me to myself				232.35292548105573

but do not despair you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my father s it was herrera				4090490.5233456963
mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance				2206.7643930858053
yes without the saddle you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom				53872.77727390216
at length they arrived at the cemetery				46581.092832688315
she is speaking said porthos i think she wants to ride on horseback oh she would like it but but what the cardinal won t allow it				5.922353079253481
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief this mass of rock like the giant adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow				10950.222295645122
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the priests mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers				232.3816230308546
athos was looking on attentively when some one touched him softly on the shoulder				292.41583447563255
the duke came straight up to him and said monsieur de tréville his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hôtel				640.877093082951

porthos had his fits				1367480.9891151586
yes i received the news this evening by a courier				7036.745278567858
but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections				229379.90461175147
is this carriage for me said dantès				91.78997772960692
every one arose				59.674987566255176

in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny				2043.086025778678
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his head up by the hair his eyes were closed and the mouth was distorted				5477602.871985997
from congo if you will it must be farther off than even that but what do i know of your parisian husbands oh my dear count husbands are pretty much the same everywhere an individual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race but then what can have led to the quarrel between danglars and debray				899.1807832508658
the three men brought the carriage up quietly and took out of it a little man stout short elderly and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color who ascended the ladder very carefully looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion came down as quietly as he had gone up and whispered it is she immediately he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion opened it with a key he had in his hand closed the door and disappeared while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder				8454.319600274566
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival				12547.26216683259
i predict from all this an avalanche of dinners and routs				5078182.702255041
sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with a bland smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment				205949.61870153263
his name tell it me then in spite of my cries in spite of my resistance for i began to comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death the executioner seized me threw me on the floor fastened me with his bonds and suffocated by sobs almost without sense invoking god who did not listen to me i uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and shame				16366.697080009299
the bustle which had been observed by henrietta maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason was occasioned by the battle of lens announced by the prince s messenger the duc de chatillon who had taken such a noble part in the engagement he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the lorraine party as well as from the spaniards upon the arches of notre dame				41.50685890312973
