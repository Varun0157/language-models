fortunately as we have said they were within a hundred paces of the city they left their two nags upon the high road and ran toward the quay				3596.7780287630194

but if anyone should entertain a false opinion of me added he drawing himself up as if he would challenge both friends and enemies i shall endeavor to correct his mistake what happened during the night asked beauchamp of château renaud we appear to make a very sorry figure here in truth what albert has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the baron				3184.1992251592605

andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper				6542.836962968728

if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose				944.6313940318437
the judge we remember that the abbé busoni remained alone with noirtier in the chamber of death and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girl s body				352.29555982386756

i then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment				1592.3053585213506
d artagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called mouston was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was				3200.282535187019
he was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for counsel				2587994.1172137805
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody				61451.87085143245
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day				158.57950022813333

one was a young man of three or four and twenty who was in love with m morrel s daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw the other was an old one eyed cashier called cocles or cock eye a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee hive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it				10.410586977695594
we shall be safer there than in the doorway ah my god whispered mme				28.141892223001264

traitors screamed lord winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the plain				24155.12320676663

he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion				3907.137409779125
exceedingly replied franz				94.43107083039149
there were two doors he bolted them both				33462.93934242214
these gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy it would be just the same today no doubt for since yesterday evening they have had plenty of time to send for a doctor then said felton who became impatient say yourself madame what treatment you wish followed eh how can i tell				1170.7525556109226
i have the honor to inform your majesty continued m de tréville in the same tone that a party of procureurs commissaries and men of the police very estimable people but very inveterate as it appears against the uniform have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house to lead away through the open street and throw into fort l evêque all upon an order which they have refused to show me one of my or rather your musketeers sire of irreproachable conduct of an almost illustrious reputation and whom your majesty knows favorably monsieur athos athos said the king mechanically yes certainly i know that name let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously				5668.929104487975
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty is what you tell me true asked the wounded man				2.4884014711561244
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit				183198.9673521891
he took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the house neat remarked d artagnan				1.0418825163832657
a cavalier charged with an important mission had come an hour before your arrival seeking hospitality at the very moment that the curé summoned to the bedside of a dying person left not only his house but the village for the entire night				410.49217744947333
and then must not all be over				335.31827850285134
it was now his turn to look about him the hôtel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings				4786.10685700175
château renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coupé joined him beauchamp did the same				265.0355651557354
you understand my dear girl continued d artagnan she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw at the door as you came in oh my god				25.168160881946307
a man came to me and showed me an order and i followed him				7.2550804131552855
from that glass door the pale faced man went to the count s bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the curtain of a window overlooking the courtyard				2908.5070946717005
the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the cardinal				756.7587669042197
pardon me i love him so much these two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace				1502674.892292291
a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining wall ripened by the same artificial heat				15099.018565438993
never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again				1024.9242644993494
dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmond s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope ladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering				5919.1344585583265
it was the island of monte cristo				1.5445646997064957
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldn t serve mazarin				526.8627703859306
flee alone flee alone and leave you here				157.48654092228867
then said she he has well played his part who has he who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from the cardinal it was then a part he was playing yes my child that man then was not that man said milady lowering her voice is my brother your brother cried mme				20.583629563619517
if the reality corresponds with appearances i am lost for a man so well off will never change his happy condition and i shall fail with him as i have already done with aramis chapter xi				377.206455009018
what a gourmand you are growing i haven t seen you with so cheerful a face these five years the duke saw that he had not controlled himself as he ought but at that moment as if he had listened at the door and comprehended the urgent need of diverting la ramee s ideas grimaud entered and made a sign to la ramee that he had something to say to him				11.382731599474301
the audience chapter iv				314.52688133963636
read said morrel				126.61309985166619
lucien looked at her for a moment in silence				129.42233589217307
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself				427.11816951472224
certes cried athos you are the best mounted poet of france or navarre well my dear aramis you don t want three horses				690.325192994302
take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek remember the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow and that you have but one day to work in and what of that				96.74136088052695
i can hold out no longer for i fear i shall be wanting in strength at the moment when i shall be forced to undergo the struggle and confess my faith				172.659411487369
i desire but one thing in this world edmond the happiness of my son pray to the almighty to spare his life and i will take upon myself to promote his happiness thank you edmond but have you no request to make for yourself mercédès for myself i want nothing				103.22985690018733
mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves pity pity on me gentlemen in heaven s name				136.2270328489705
i was present during his last moments				2259.072603831215
the return d artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation				1932957.3451407768
this duet is one of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti				2903633.7890034546
selim selim cried he guardian of the fire do your duty selim is dead replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth and you are lost ali at the same moment an explosion was heard and the flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms the troops were firing from underneath				4942649.562754255
it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep yes sire said aramis yes you are right				155.09729053184006
at length she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on valentine				2063.1456154085336
this child has caused me to recover what i had lost				546.706015485537
decidedly you are a brave fellow said athos pressing the young man s hand				22.223595077945628
what is the matter barrois said valentine				315.1919865746243
villefort understood the king s intent				2251080.0924198665
no sentinels no one at any of the windows				443.5658410768129
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep				261451.67481932332
to no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king s ransom in his waistcoat pocket				1374.9169459717154
well yes you have to know me yet				2382.402237564256
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary d artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach				1391112.8885675075
it is different with my mother who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to part with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease m de morcerf whose portrait by gros i will also show you				57.098120173098266
during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts				860.3833978433203
you see i have not these necessary papers fortunately i have them though said monte cristo				1.0589718822000087
a sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercédès who must believe him dead				296.6112592328372
i am ready to answer any questions your excellency may address to me how did the viscount albert fall into luigi s hands excellency the frenchman s carriage passed several times the one in which was teresa the chief s mistress yes				214.93303597072375
they were indeed admirably received by mazarin who paid them numerous compliments and announced that they were more than half on their way to obtain what they desired namely d artagnan his captaincy porthos his barony				460048.54501215776
on approaching the house he perceived m bonacieux in morning costume standing at his threshold				1153.5369741169359
pray was not monsieur d artagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly my lord as to the report you allude to guitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak out i know nothing but what the public knows				4210.982847867808
there was a moment s silence				228.96691967151455
and was he not the person who was assassinated one evening on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor villefort looked at the count almost with terror				110.4970119719381
as he alighted he thought he saw his father s pale face behind the curtain of the count s bedroom				1222.954002613903
the queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed her				18.20531111972685
no it does not concern me				6.975679769559599
believe your own eyes m de boville took the paper danglars presented him and read received of baron danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand francs to be repaid on demand by the house of thomson french of rome it is really true said m de boville				1529.4858330742638
felton and he addressed patrick the duke s confidential lackey at the same moment				172.4677703655231
it could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness for in truth he only drank to combat this sadness which wine however as we have said rendered still darker				2228.4714017899237
come and open then cried d artagnan to the man with the scythe taking one of the pistols up by the muzzle and preparing to strike with the handle				37142.07712320983
then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the cellar				839.3540744292454
at least keep him there till my daughter be married impossible madame justice has its formalities what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest				1525197.7912800633
here he is d artagnan walking and soliloquizing had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel d arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived aramis chatting gaily with three gentlemen but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m de tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see him				12.421353493505777
is then all that i have heard really true she inquired				4615.184323295078
he was charged to tell the comte de la fere that she had learned of the return of her youthful protege and also the manner he had conducted himself on the field and she added that she should be very glad to offer him her congratulations				1657491.7771577716
the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic fir trees and myrtles				40610.23462796
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace				1022.4192096759241
come come fernand said caderousse hold up your head and answer us				209.5731297092667
bazin stretched his arms rubbed his eyes and tried to go to sleep again				78.59164860101393
he would have inquired after them of their mistresses but he was neither acquainted with porthos s nor aramis s and as to athos he had none				8920.280643705317
you are taking a poetical tone and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening				160.7039889127642
valentine we may easily conceive where morrel s appointment was				696.0928887905063
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced felton was hers				13620.002166479471
no no my boy i prefer remaining honorably in the capital andrea scowled				1555103.1278696964
observe this is one of her peculiarities to get rid thus after one fashion or another of all the people who bother her				3320.409504548934
d artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him				82.84660430624668
they spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them				23.032727990230878
when i leave him i place in my stead a bold fellow who aspires to be his majesty s special guard				501.5172560819326
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell				3082.357874162751
come come continued the count complaints are unavailing be a man be strong be full of hope for i am here and will watch over you morrel shook his head sorrowfully				4049.542906249453
and your business is that of a confectioner in the rue des lombards explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots not badly answered i faith said gondy laughing but i have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations well my lord before i became a confectioner i myself was three years sergeant in the piedmontese regiment and before i became sergeant i was for eighteen months the servant of monsieur d artagnan the lieutenant of musketeers asked gondy				13436.839423758533
and whatever might be considering the violent character of milady the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her				155.92357717562766
i ll circulate that saying be assured my dear fellow				508.56577722476067
in the evening about nine o clock at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed he heard steps in his corridor				2164.7463610175496
the french ladies madame				609.7585440112348
yes answered maximilian but i feel sure he has an excellent heart and that he likes us his voice went to my heart observed julie and two or three times i fancied that i had heard it before chapter				4256.7541279022935
you were in the south of france i think yes replied andrea with an embarrassed air i was in the south of france a carriage was to await you at nice precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambéry from chambéry to pont de beauvoisin and from pont de beauvoisin to paris indeed				709.4454741667023
while you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him come now aramis said d artagnan you must be taking me for some one else nevertheless said athos in your absence well in my absence haven t i put in my place grimaud and the scotchman				13091.834019346801
i can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear count for confessing to some degree of astonishment nay answered monte cristo with the most gentlemanly air tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be incommoded				5095530.592862246
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you				23.872225350083383
i merely ask you did you not refuse to go to brussels for the queen whilst you had consented to go there to do some service for the late cardinal that is the very reason i refused to go back to brussels				26324.041209281655
aramis was astonished				3003.7506299298693
during the exchange of these two words felton drew back quickly and when lord de winter entered he was several paces from the prisoner				119.3033178695881
without doubt senor and you understand that they would have saved the king to be sure said porthos with majestic common sense they were in the majority and you think said aramis he will consent to appear before such a tribunal he will be forced to do so smiled the spaniard				3800714.432122448
then they were both silent				240.96267086292693
the abbé took the note				12860.133253792414
the two children met sat down near each other let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together in the evening they separated the count of san felice s flock from those of baron cervetri and the children returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next morning				280.0661928002069
we can dispose of the business if we please in an hour for i have received a letter from m delaunay in which he offers to purchase the good will of the house to unite with his own for francs				212.68044947111656
but m de tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d artagnan to render the king any signal service or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action				1430.3986297968029
describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hands going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me let us see the watch said albert				42.734876778591435
danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town				321038.86654602183
no replied the turnkey you destroy everything				189.19997552980766
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this idea to him				15.362841645364556
the cardinal advanced to him with a smile and taking him by the hand led him into his study				682.6692716009169
ah said d artagnan i did not see that it was the sword of the comte de wardes which made that hole when he gave me a good thrust in the breast you are wounded asked buckingham as he opened the letter				123.32176614904351
when the emperor returned from the island of elba my brother instantly joined the army was slightly wounded at waterloo and retired with the army beyond the loire but that is the history of the hundred days m bertuccio said the count unless i am mistaken it has been already written excuse me excellency but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient go on i will keep my word one day we received a letter				182.95425428722547
noirtier was near the bed pale motionless and silent as the corpse				706.175679381722
the prince was said to be in person at bethune				429568.7964894998
they explained what had occurred that evening				356.19803373973883
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted				143698.82996235404
not before me behind me but with what asked the duke				12.668477982280402
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand				71.70620505462877
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d artagnan who however placed himself between him and them				85.72665197261382
my jeweler and my secretary the valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed to obey blindly and without reply				2302.6777521549625
i have never been understood and no wonder				27719.959423441407
ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like mère simon s son who has not chosen the worst strawberries				2471547.5079888604
as you see my health is but indifferent				9807346.927473627
your excellencies permit it asked the host				52.73459603145595
as he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue				19091.280653452282
six of his eminence s guards arrest six of his majesty s musketeers				542.4328922444071
the lights again				114.4409964999116
take your glass then and let us drink				56435.630243058135
d artagnan started on seeing these tears				1823.940829652527
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man i am d artagnan don t you know me				21.207131179887188
a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner				596.0065378219653
what say you morrel ma foi he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about me gentlemen said albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready				955.7819054384313

to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when d artagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure				13817.160466887275

cries were soon heard and then moans which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle				2222525.712926061
athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality				9674746.568345465
poor queen murmured athos				4.28058227338837
this night i have had a fearful sleep				330.3619984551037
that is the hour when i am expected madame said the young man bowing i can refuse nothing asked of me thus				234.28854620903834
never cried d artagnan				1.0705264801947272
i respected your father very much said he				9.774850511420443
leave the room and send me a woman women are very indiscreet my sister				2588.709717894395
i will call for them today no tomorrow i shall not have time today well tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil may i depend on it certainly because i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it now see here will that be all				136.6314766162822
then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife are we then going to travel my lord asked mousqueton rather uneasy				1149.841075829033
this time he could not blame dantès				201.6544820571026
vampa then removed the stone and cucumetto came out				633.822756808922
he only changed his sword hand and fought with his left hand				32.24752713705104
d artagnan and his two companions turned their backs and commenced a retreat which resembled a flight				8062.092038802405
had a real liking for tréville a royal liking a self interested liking it is true but still a liking				3415546.398399249
i will not sleep where i must scorn				261838.93662996215
it is a misfortune and government owes nothing to his family				1096.7502977425654
to cours la reine cried d artagnan to the coachman then turning to mazarin he said now my lord you can say five paters and five aves in thanks to heaven for your deliverance				11295596.044841152
he then began to ascend the path				92883.31545320427
when i returned she was married				114822.97674838139
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second				1565.1765351425513
as to that you must leave it to me i give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like d artagnan shook his head				11.658142442902912
his shoulder knots were of burnished silver his mantle had no gold nor embroidery on it a simple plume of violet feathers adorned his hat his boots were of black leather and at his girdle hung that sword with a magnificent hilt that porthos had so often admired in the rue feron				4510972.82280948
there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate				2126.3675135284348
he gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and monte cristo passed a paper to albert				403.5246050482602
come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terrace one moment gentlemen cried flamarens				10316723.047111766
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellow the true type of a duenna or a devotee				15635043.476551434
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry				27122.228268653318
on the evening of the of september m morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study				780.5858051978826
one man alone remained in his place gun in hand				115.3938543096525
she bit her handkerchief with her beautiful teeth				894.1036130441714
i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed				9094.812200979675
we must content ourselves then said beauchamp with rendering the count all the little services in our power				646.4486200296604
this is frightful				9024.68128334252
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his grace s lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written				2081.123449786465
soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god				2181.893216701866
m de tréville listened to the young man s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair				404.3944898307111
to regret the world is to regret the devil that is my conclusion and that is mine also said the curate				112324.2063863248
i am king of all creation				3945166.168589236
aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces the man ended by fairly taking to his heels and disappeared amid the hooting of the lackeys				12876.135952080067
i have warned m danglars of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese				3896021.793237019
i only ask a brokerage of course that is perfectly just cried m de boville				8859.814283536605
on arriving at the king s private antechamber m de tréville found la chesnaye who informed him that they had not been able to find m de la trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel that he returned too late to present himself at the louvre that he had only that moment arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king				165.65323535916627
but morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets				1512497.5399511412
but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody s professions of friendship				4098.973828893459
at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers				258.6115007902857
aramis bit his lips till the blood came				2117.3828412573002
in the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw and that is all a prisoner can wish for				106.51378385235728
where asked maximilian				8827.444848816027
but at daybreak he awoke				3523.0783439829283
and why in this solemn drawing room when the study is so comfortable i quite understand why you ask sir said eugénie making a sign that her father might be seated and in fact your two questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation				416.8207164502958
at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half open door and told his master that the horses were ready				887.6741578791003
when you come to paris i will return all this i will not refuse i intend going there soon and since you allow me i will pay you a visit				800.6362186158307
and those two crayon portraits that have faded from the dampness do they not seem to say with their pale lips and staring eyes we have seen villefort became livid madame danglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney				143632.5169962653
oh yes returned monte cristo i make no secret of it				10.64018479501365
have they not obeyed me it is done as your excellency may have observed your horse is in the great gateway ready saddled for your departure that is well do as i have directed you then what the devil said the host to himself				42.35861028193888
but this time the papers were a mere matter of form				19521.831324127746
ah cried he on perceiving d artagnan ah				343.7495597405158
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard				5048572.504253878
does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the host				72.4564496766062
just think				404.5055753492178
one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory				198909.91242105642
if a thunderbolt had fallen at the banker s feet he could not have experienced greater terror				734.4546465346194
i hastened to the innkeeper				8046.092560706982
what more is to be done i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son				170.3611944698379
i swear to you again rather than betray you i would allow myself to be hacked in pieces you have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for i was about to form another plan and leave you but your age reassures me				4.538703101090853
well i swear to you all three that had the executioner of bethune was he not of bethune yes egad				3569.7373720792807
why does he go in secret				3028.7301084409837
is the king of the spaniards never had a penny in his pocket go on sir i see what you wish to get at and if it is simply what i think that stops you i can obviate the difficulty ah i knew well said the gascon that you were a man of talent				17586262.78377049
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended				145730.31218595704
at this moment planchet brought out athos s horse the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle				298.84511306490737
my master will go to dinner and after dinner he will sleep an hour then he is going to the opera are you sure of it asked albert				40.54983917957742
then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea				284.11680882211357
although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m de tréville s courtiers and this his first appearance in that place he was at length noticed and somebody came and asked him what he wanted				84.06265584444513
he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize at first sight the italian or german nobleman				11219.418000883994
it was the will of god that this should happen blessed be his name				176.6925641820375
how will you have them protect you				9.381979271406522
it was not possible as he knew well to confine for the whole of his life the grandson of henry iv especially when this young prince was scarcely thirty years of age				1069.3209812252614
you were speaking of the champs élysées just now worthy foster father well well in the champs élysées there resides a very rich gentleman at whose house you robbed and murdered did you not i believe i did the count of monte cristo tis you who have named him as m racine says				16303365.14914793
go i must be alone morrel subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy monte cristo exercised over everything around him did not endeavor to resist it				6.406524798697861
who occupies number the little fellow who arrived last night in a post chaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish				3670.5209338977634
bigamy my dear				2392391.908807776
a bruise yes i think i received a flower pot upon my head brutes said d artagnan				1.0395928633850453
answer me do not these crimes exist yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance				749.7004516447969
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever				2175.7551376663837
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion				399.4878506777305
two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand but albert a first rate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo				5742887.828568508
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths				12334789.778743908
but you only asked francs for a fowl we have a fixed price for all our provisions				51855.55709756823
meantime he uncorked the bottles and went to smell if the pie was good				467.54707467294395
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors				3959.868372597857
lack a day				440.14651423677344
to speak to you about me of what else do you imagine he would speak to me				7.139293643747317
his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it immediately				751.1274583427779
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information and you replied to him with that notion nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and i was so to him but if he be a spy what do you think a spy would be about here				724.2726318459376
fire cried grimaud unconsciously				5326886.26658711
but if we do risk being killed said porthos at least i should like to know what for you would be all the wiser said athos				3.9995408474085394
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf				780.472660854304
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away				1654.220415478906
he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in m de tréville s stables one for himself d artagnan and one for planchet and bring them to athos s place				177.71252171990508
yes but i am expecting some one a friend of athos a friend exclaimed the count				6.913938113509146
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid				3559.9089026485403
now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the countess g was ah to be sure replied château renaud the lovely venetian is it not herself at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile				129.79166100481277
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance				1496285.5913891587
her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name				191.8052805890348
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough				266.1221164766537
i hate him so little that i should be delighted to order masses for the repose of his soul you are not called lionne for nothing observed madame de chevreuse your teeth are terrible you are unjust to a great poet it seems to me raoul ventured to say				513.2799262435443
well it is a question of serving the king the gentleman s duty but the king is with mazarin he is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the king s enemies are preparing for the poor child ah				153.34459810703407
but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait athos stopped				567.0569976369763
this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night are you quite sure of that certain				1425012.4176901267
there is your money half in bank notes the other half in checks payable to bearer				1299467.4145485726
a dinner in the old style				50694.62908285147
villefort burst it open with a violent blow				1706.1866409341244
deuce take it cried d artagnan more moved than he had been for a long time don t despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one oh really cried raoul				66.07674564408659
a rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of honor				869.8361189040147
i dare say you have not brought too large a stock of money with you d artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said i ask alms of no man oh that s very well young man continued m de tréville that s all very well				134.47901915960952
i had only to cry out help for you and for your companions to be cut to pieces and then i should have been free why didn t you do it asked the lieutenant				157.25354212693566
the foundation s business office is located at north west salt lake city ut				237.92835632072268
monsieur said the count to albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise				1503.0108388383835
take my wealth my fortune my glory all the days i have to live for such an instant for a night like that				105.81629665863409
the jailer brought him his breakfast				56268.118624188086
the news of the arrival of the pharaon had not yet reached the old man who mounted on a chair was amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window				272.6682522974901
not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen				673.1493233056534
grimaud going in advance followed the course which they were to take in the evening				203.47665502400187
the rest concerns myself don t be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis				15.905993315065592
let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear buckingham				284.88817884629896
the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of d artagnan				1.0650136443736236
return emmanuel to your charming wife and present my best compliments to her and do you morrel accompany me to the champs élysées willingly said maximilian particularly as i have business in that quarter shall we wait breakfast for you asked emmanuel				784.6897747981068
we will take a bite and shall be there as soon as you are just as you please gentlemen provided we set sail he said				7.809615940397593
albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling				1689.9079072141942
if any one asks you whose it is you can say that it belongs to an irish gentleman the sailor departed without reply				951.8005648637254
he tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything				271.63552689725
will your excellency visit saint peter s asked the cicerone				410413577.0843775
he replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment				37357.88695283789
don t let it out at the hotel rambouillet it would ruin me replied the abbé				14.253084821225105
certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence				1505.6139636199005
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door				16.50076453673984
i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice really said danglars				30.90212633729629
oh bid him enter and the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold				174.87960853531433
once past the frontier andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank notes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all				112.0963135552342
and aramis i see you have not forgotten the name no she said poor aramis a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses				10257741.465517554
i dreamed that i saw you lying bleeding wounded in the left side was it not and with a knife interrupted buckingham				225.06247295449765
it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he i know and admire the corsican nature too well to fear you				21.23003789848992
in anticipation of some ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed his two servants at the head of the band thus forming the advance guard				1026.9960932847941
no no my dear edmond my boy my son no but i did not expect you and joy the surprise of seeing you so suddenly ah i feel as if i were going to die come come cheer up my dear father				288.4155969446321
as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets				11030398.756850338
you are late general i wished to see the ceremony to the end which delayed me ah				144.733558371339
ah stop				703.4359781671827
i saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses i heard my glass removed the same which is there now on the table oh dear mother it was a dream so little was it a dream that i stretched my hand towards the bell but when i did so the shade disappeared my maid then entered with a light but she saw no one phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them				20.851094576684403
when they opened the window they saw the poor lad lying senseless with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork				10645368.280373089
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information you think resumed mazarin that rochefort he was cardinal richelieu s creature my lord				32.40808276695706
he proposed the conditions the two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pistoles				566.9648008309209
accept this half pistole to drink to my health i do not drink bazin pushed away with dignity the officer s hand tis good only for the laity incorruptible murmured d artagnan i am unlucky and whilst he was lost in thought bazin retreated toward the sacristy and even there he could not think himself safe until he had shut and locked the door behind him				5.751085932265538
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages				8037.617973030428
raoul at the same time seized one of the young man s hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man				40.9988057500461
athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman				1361.9456201974142
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue				6944.028228333858
d artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still agitated				5295.338053540409
we have no litmus paper but see here they come with the syrup of violets the doctor was right steps were heard in the passage				699.2849863009006
gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit				4162564.87315202
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber				55.984878893901
oh cried mme				15.99196076040663
it closed after him with a spring				4946.659697612704

why did you not say so at once my dear sir				61.795161791911006
he made a movement of surprise and said father you are very young men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dryly				2190973.1780963037
at least i am now at liberty to believe without too much fatuity that you love another said the young man in a caressing tone and i repeat that i am really interested for the count you asked milady				40.98809388444359
i should find myself therefore more at my ease facilius natans in a subject of my own choice which would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to metaphysics in philosophy d artagnan began to be tired and so did the curate				29680.043746046
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future				605.3126064430913
what would your excellency like and peppino placed his pan on the ground so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of danglars				269.66973578758933
a firm and well practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond				385.593765119802

oh my god cried she my god				59.346468722547684

chapter lxvi				254.56653228492192
i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real enemy and by the rapid glance that the young man s eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness				338607.00741454767

for the rest as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days if porthos were still at the great st martin he would call for him on his way				300.9457935094047

monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested i shall be delighted to have your opinion the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied d artagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen the two men in black bowed in their turn				141.67930306316708

to the judge to the judge madame it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman the anguish of her look the trembling of her whole frame				1495.526492893119
i am convinced that if i gave him a box on the ear such as i gave this morning to the little citizen who splashed me it would change the appearance of things and i my dear aramis quietly replied athos i think it would only change monsieur de retz s appearance				3227.659679379308
come tell me all the good fortune that has befallen you god forgive me said the young man for rejoicing at happiness derived from the misery of others but heaven knows i did not seek this good fortune it has happened and i really can not pretend to lament it				7.0823369535511675

then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frock coat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire put on his travelling cap and calling his valet checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his carriage which was ready learned at lyons that bonaparte had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road at length reached marseilles a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes				6821838.526418275
i can not now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it poor father murmured the priest				425.4002501816878
they entered the common hall and placed themselves at table				184.8956131073267
but d artagnan had reckoned without the wind				1266.903455836223
and of what malady it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face the smallpox				1691447.062799009

d artagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name				120.23346407709464
well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu admirable sire but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety my dear duke when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours and that without getting in the least out of breath ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young man who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful information				524.6726096830927
they took their places and the ballet began				362.60423485396103

oh heavens exclaimed morrel i do not deceive myself that young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is albert de morcerf yes said monte cristo i recognized him how so you were looking the other way the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the street				445.28343580102216
follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance				1513.2974337695944
here monsieur mazarin is everything does he desire to play the part in france that cromwell plays in england oh no				36.61125201093645
i make about twelve thousand francs a year without counting a little benefice of a thousand crowns the prince gave me and how do you make your twelve thousand francs				152.55190838143764
he saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery				47837.18149638916
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady followed				45203.95134736436
guard the prisoners well i beg of you the sergeant made a sign as much as to say he did not understand french and d artagnan tried to make him comprehend by signs and gestures				48384.27214573298
what can the chancellor have to say to me that your majesty could not say yourself the king turned upon his heel without reply and almost at the same instant the captain of the guards m de guitant announced the visit of the chancellor				80100.43837075823
you knew i should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me no for i saw god s justice placed in the hands of benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence god s justice				1882.0704522310502
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could				9544.652637273302
in fact i am dead				32.34945166396463
he took his army to the priest s where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornet s who performed wonders but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal d artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions as the breakfast at the priest s could only be counted as half a repast in return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him				9.810895156761626
she joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a word				197.61047561543967
perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and i suffered more than they would have done in my place that is all the countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath				754602.2266619737
my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still i shall love you as i loved my father it is well returned the voice tomorrow these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall				106.14006989592426
a sacerdotal officer				8551.806769410656
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said danglars to andrea				1219.7910128152635
i thought i did replied athos but no doubt i was mistaken and he returned d artagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at it				7.584871795012997
you are the king s servant and must go wherever that service calls you oh villefort cried renée clasping her hands and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the day of our betrothal the young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her chair said tenderly to give you pleasure my sweet renée i promise to show all the lenity in my power but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off renée shuddered at the word cut for the growth in question had a head				456.27926674658505
ah my dear aramis this time i shall find you out and d artagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche				7245912.165442729
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows				339.156223773585
since that time many things have happened to you				16.928774007519824
take out the horses quickly and come up to me said andrea to his groom				42145.124345016135
aramis less self controlled fumbled continually with his hidden poniard				4744518.072882265
alas said d avrigny she is indeed dead poor child yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had raised				14511.696611792735
the bars were filled with drinkers				2496704.2033713
the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated				9182.119611307315
villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught				40056.42625566832
he had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine				4000904.9682551743
i go to the louvre i ask for mme				79.20593548570915
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman s word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be so that s porthos all over murmured d artagnan				1.0260530707374542
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard				996.1475389725875
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir				92.52820380354996
the two prisoners chapter				4.378714820789353
the man whom athos had come so far to seek and whom he had found with so much trouble introduced him into his laboratory where he was engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a skeleton				11434348.570407785
every five minutes albert took out his watch at length it pointed to seven				9835.2904400463
but you don t know us when we can t have one thing we invent another and have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody only to our host				1977.2981062254637
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor				3398410.428975959
you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i can not remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all no monsieur i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbé busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but i pray you go away from that plane tree				4218576541.205202
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report				32261.68770070007
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this world large fortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy				1540.0968192114938
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night				406.4308745156862
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling in a week i shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy				13925.689165499405
it appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his journey				469.2713727321472
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you maximilian whom i love as my own son				438.7203984955018
and he began to wander about the room like a man beside himself gesticulating and half drawing his sword out of the scabbard				355.35454748392505
i think nothing my friend but all things are possible				376.63994304437193
how were you to blame in that affair listen when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive everybody pities you sir and above all mademoiselle danglars poor eugénie said danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life no alas it is unhappily but too true				245.71417920256786
help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean				2180.7605067699906
sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour half an hour s rest is enough replied the gascon				65.24778757111618
i am getting more and more seasick go in then grimaud said mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet				1837723.1288241257
ten minutes later the curate of st sulpice was announced				277.2728133785511
frequenting the café de paris the boulevard de gand and the bois de boulogne during his brief career of splendor the false cavalcanti had formed a host of acquaintances				2627170.1773493676
in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path				15403.267451155027
what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go why i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily bravo porthos				142.75047758322822
he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four and twenty hours				879.1729936318804
if the window had been open or even ajar i should think nothing of it but no all was hermetically sealed				5679479.058344941
you were told to guard her to fire at her if she attempted to fly				5545.72617853996
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair				342.67237852309864
notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain villefort rose as he perceived her				60.84889556395651
my faith my good host said d artagnan filling the two glasses i asked for a bottle of your best wine and if you have deceived me you will be punished in what you have sinned for seeing that i hate drinking by myself you shall drink with me				36.34326827904192
have you been or are you his mistress oh no cried milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth				704.500077585568
stay said d artagnan and taking out his handkerchief he gagged him				21.97423633209682
give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and i will hand you over the money he rose gave his seat to m de boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the englishman counted out the bank notes on the other side of the desk				3846.999419406032
the chancellor entered half smiling half blushing				232395.82920525258
thus d artagnan entered paris on foot carrying his little packet under his arm and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms suited to the scantiness of his means				5143.741650848648
monsieur porthos				236.7951711891587
no no returned monte cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion				294815.1454071111
it is the truth however				1437660.6932738207
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside				588256.191264587
i shall find him there without doubt you will monsieur he persists in remaining there				771.0926629794001
in the avenue des champs élysées that the count of monte cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps				1443.6556406409754
formerly a brewer replied the gascon				43.68940262530225
i can not calmly say with you providence has struck the blow but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me				4.807050706722006
ask baron franz d épinay i think he tasted them one day yes replied morcerf he said something about it to me but said beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you always would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage				755757.4201821075
his fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king				155.93331735020004
as long as the procurator s wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself				620.1729543876462
what is that line				295652.49510122294
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared				319.6565697698643
the young man stood before her sorrowful and resolute				54406.22913762916
well he shall live mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristo s eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect them far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir				5643993.971358238
monarchs are only strong by the assistance of the aristocracy but aristocracy can not survive without the countenance of monarchs				1969439.2783727336
two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling				25.059360605970113
the old man listened attentively making a sign only that it was all so and then when d artagnan had ended he shook his head with an air that announced nothing good				349.96191194990075
he crossed the court ran up the two flights to athos s apartment and knocked at the door enough to break it down				1247.942507428429
really i might even say that we have some reason to praise him impossible yes really it is owing to him that we are free owing to him yes he had us conducted into the orangery by monsieur bernouin his valet de chambre and from there we followed him to visit the comte de la fere				102.02505204567838
remember madame if our god forbids falsehood he much more severely condemns suicide when god sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly placed between suicide and dishonor believe me sir replied milady in a tone of deep conviction god pardons suicide for then suicide becomes martyrdom you say either too much or too little speak madame				726.9173815304954
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life				247.7904069984251
all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted d artagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for a minute but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint				150691.33605199785
albert entered looking very handsome and in high spirits				25091.42537839187
i have charged myself with this affair				822.834595738583
no pity for him who had no pity				8214.40970484552
i think madame danglars again requires your bottle he said				6.94994548837632

ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am that gentleman i say what has become of him deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful				8443938.043522215
then they undressed him as they had done the first laid him on their bed and bound him with the straps which composed the bed the bedstead being of oak				813.668364110996
bonacieux it is a man i don t know although he seems to be coming here				286.0428880989309
the conversation took place in english a language which d artagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage				15040.411254243081
dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of joy everyone inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in				292.5045284157827
for his father s death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercédès				974.0912767157126
her mouth was mute but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked				2782518.991651726
la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing				2150469.578741573
instead of that louise do you understand air liberty melody of birds plains of lombardy venetian canals roman palaces the bay of naples				536.8068424772537
well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister s secretary				66200.34669552483
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness				2707106.409317249
albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole but he kept the faded one in his hand and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lips an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also				327.11906282354965
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers i regard them as invaluable now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with anxiety				1143.6277392686136

oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship				10290.314157842717

but he is mistaken i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point anne blushed and buried her face in her hands				50.59509270431971
athos and aramis left paris after this coup d etat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the parisians had been beaten at charenton				508356.34650009987
a man was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the openings of which the new comers contemplated him				7.123614599573857
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore				4909.952874115723
to whom is it addressed to monsieur noirtier rue coq héron paris had a thunderbolt fallen into the room villefort could not have been more stupefied				5443.578439917303
the fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played				101022.82967231935
bradshaw waited and as there was no reply there was a moment of silence				214.44134908536847
this treasure will be lost				494.2396755276331
athos who had pocketed his share of the diamond seldom quit the parpaillot				2659091.7583485404
he saw d artagnan s movement heard the sound of the click and stopped at once				78.6749255949186
who art thou cried he clasping his hands				40.129213208473686
what then have i to fear from him you are right said the countess and my fears are weakness especially when directed against a man who has saved your life				206.4871829188432

on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start				1246483.7850303652
there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver				4737.344569981393
beat the messenger cried porthos				14.44902069543817

they passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open country				316.1805224267222
danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered				2465048.2494651936
thus the dealer to whom d artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the originality of his color				246614.27357158845
aramis cried athos i am arrested good replied aramis calmly				99.98322313459208

the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of despair				338.0283115409529
his excellency does not receive visitors today then here is my master s card the baron danglars				28.770489868207655

it was evident that there was clamor and sedition				4043170.3118435526
aramis notwithstanding his self control could not refrain from a slight movement of surprise				376.3914642908226
pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my excuse				1720.1301889253168

he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie				13355.777756651696
he descended fifteen steps and the door of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in				351.0921408025566
madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority				4071330.932995034
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by way of precaution				9817.223063261203
yes replied the abbé it is very affecting mercédès came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home				1548.4870642204758
she stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the three none other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed put her to torture and she ll soon tell us where her money is it unfortunately happened that our neighbor wasilio was at bastia leaving no person in his house but his wife no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling				2003448.9832766075
i might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but i did nothing of the sort i suffered him and his band to depart with the condition that they should sin no more said beauchamp laughing				20.464087335775837
then he paused				5238.828920349945
after having sought for a few minutes he stopped at a leaf which had several notes and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the table and recalling his souvenirs auteuil rue de la fontaine no				35.71834849738146
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones				11033.201476987373
these undertakings do not suit me as you know aramis why because it is taking people unawares really athos you would make a singular general				2521.3447386913863

at the names comte de la fere and chevalier d herblay charles opened his eyes and raising his noble head in spite of himself threw a glance at all the actors in the scene				1285.7569842933337
will they never bring that emetic asked the doctor				251.4162921620642
these men were shopkeepers who had arms to lend to those who had none				8405.183918285615
therefore let everyone here look upon what has passed today as if it had not happened and as though we had never thought of such a thing as a change in our original plans sir said the count the world unjust as it is will be pleased with your resolution your friends will be proud of you and m d épinay even if he took mademoiselle de villefort without any dowry which he will not do would be delighted with the idea of entering a family which could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a duty at the conclusion of these words the count rose to depart				7055.728745210672
take it from me when i am dead yes sire said a voice which athos recognized as that of aramis				104.25154877452805
on approaching an outpost near the barriere des sergens the sentinel cried out who s there and d artagnan answered having first asked the word of the cardinal louis and rocroy after which he inquired if lieutenant comminges were not the commanding officer at the outpost				7364357.736763503
ah he exclaimed that woman became criminal only from associating with me				26.07765544754641

i understand said the child with that jeering smile which marks especially the gamin de paris well we must wait they had not long to wait				1494.7885931006424
then noirtier raised his eyes to heaven as though to remind his son of a forgotten oath				2719.579872998868
it was the queen				192.57912471989368
the cicerone reclosed the door and sprang up by the side of the coachman				2847.853716410419
madame said he the count and yourself recompense too generously a simple action				6906.646755714666
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen				135.7315910435347
from that day d artagnan felt lonely and powerless without courage to pursue a career in which he could only distinguish himself on condition that each of his three companions should endow him with one of the gifts each had received from heaven				104.44440682526586
he has seen him said athos in a low tone to aramis				226.78310232339723
the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau such is the instability of the human mind was the sullen face of grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope				1397.8492528004108
mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before				207.9557041345563

the two friends sat down to table but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the count of monte cristo s table and that of signor pastrini				7197.937712852302
teresa and luigi reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the presence of twenty bandits				6063.965557271027
one of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance				106739.64117228167
d artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table				198.9906250509176
and who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green oh that coat is not his own idea it is the republic s which deputed to devise a uniform for the academicians indeed said monte cristo so this gentleman is an academician within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly and what is his especial talent his talent				817690.9174786989

as to felton he hesitates				12242675.343863953
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless and how was m de saint méran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count				6.145839780363625
in the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met				92765.48969404453
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king which would not prevent me said d artagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you d artagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter haberdasher she is afraid so wait a minute then said aramis				19.84734035770816
the count laid his hand on franz s shoulder				102.65887026341056

charles stuart had asked that bishop juxon might be permitted to visit him				3.564827907381085
in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly				23706.45233729091
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly				11178.513011448385
since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me				11.411436894641025
then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the names of all those who either in his political career in money matters at the bar or in his mysterious love affairs had become his enemies				1829.7179609490133
he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow				828.8382840312438
they are the count of château renaud whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a place at the round table m lucien debray private secretary to the minister of the interior m beauchamp an editor of a paper and the terror of the french government but of whom in spite of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in italy since his paper is prohibited there and m maximilian morrel captain of spahis at this name the count who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy but at the same time with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks				1023.8628216616568
the procurator s wife took porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation				12208304.234703014

bonacieux with great emotion in my name i beg you				119.49752160013762
how go then exclaimed d artagnan				1.0367466215009946
whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident monsieur bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed				2511.676626113365
after the king and the cardinal m de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens				139627.1850843414
and now leave me monsieur bertuccio to walk alone here in the garden				472.0493387405562
in the meanwhile how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those thousands of nothings which constitute a woman s happiness and be unable to give her those thousands of nothings				2230839.322937075
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile				226.45805455238482
ah you speak spanish enough i think to fulfill your highness s wishes on this occasion meanwhile the prisoner had remained impassive and as if he had no understanding of what was taking place				167.43448112988432

at bottom the character of m bonacieux was one of profound selfishness mixed with sordid avarice the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice				10803628.508123646
you will bring lights and relieve the sentinel continued felton				48.24960282429911
that s well said he to planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the equipment				8348.893869730335
with the deputy s knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence				5686.9390464488415
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor				109463.22899997135
three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him				3.2961550500735304
i wish to say three words to you monsieur chevalier stammered the soubrette				65639.5837713539
suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee				765.4134499819321
a poet is as good as an abbé				1944.5648115340632
so much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his suspicions				2166.447114059486
anyone else would have hastened to receive him but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness				14189.356513849649

for a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him				4.862026035199485
at the foot of the stairs valentine found barrois awaiting her				13.565129063027307

it is the count s reply poor kitty became as pale as death she suspected what the letter contained				2205475.9536565933
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown				9425123.447005462
i did not expect to see you again said he feebly to dantès				222.4957900351203

it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths				1678588.2468068725

she then turned towards the avenue				149066.31727618907
of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow				174.26561096045356
poverty overtook you				61.33134476727535

milady seized the occasion				6511.004642922972

an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques unfortunately the general s valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker s lips turned alternately red and pale				406.12265350903454
athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right				2458.613911981029
andrea shuddered and looked on the young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such ferocious honor				4681.893856723895
he has slain his uncle he murmured				253.20676055831768
good thought d artagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them very well i understand go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend				215.90692501473953

noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room				56.539891973928064
athos was the last to enter				3602.016255719997
but all three reflected upon the youth of d artagnan and dreaded his inexperience				2983539.2881989134
d artagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville the other was a convent of jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers				24579.141921779305

i don t say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind it s a sure way to prevent it s coming true how so why in this way if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape good lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny				6437.260628063586
you offered me hospitality and i accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow				197.68059369760164

begone begone at these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed d artagnan out of the room				51.928249944063495
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed d artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock				27242.615308263103

what a wrist you have reverend sir said caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what a wrist silence				610.8952934005534
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian				3172059.273877611

but never mind he is a neighbor who has done us a service on a time so he s welcome as edmond paused the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at the door				18.07367367843742
at sight of this pale bleeding man the wife grasped her husband s arm				160.7795634960171
for i have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild				3039690.080284659

athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly				4779281.581950027

no replied noirtier eagerly				33.818017059425806
the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window				69.54956615620831
as he passed the hôtel des gardes he took a glance into the stables				625.196205249023
it is an every day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart				25.647473956151167
adieu my charmer i will wait to pay you my next visit till you are in a better humor at these words he blew a whistle the globe of fire which lighted the room reascended and disappeared				376.15570480656885
ah my dear friend he cried what bad stabling for my horses here indeed said d artagnan i am most unhappy to hear it on account of those fine animals and i also i was also wretchedly off he answered moving backward and forward as he spoke and had it not been for the hostess he added with his air of vulgar self complacency who is very agreeable and understands a joke i should have got a lodging elsewhere the pretty madeleine who had approached during this colloquy stepped back and turned pale as death on hearing porthos s words for she thought the scene with the swiss was about to be repeated				14536.35172196963

but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name so he has but i like mine as well certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic i prefer m andrea cavalcanti to m albert de morcerf still i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the cavalcanti the morcerfs stay my dear count said danglars you are a man of the world are you not i think so and you understand heraldry a little well look at my coat of arms it is worth more than morcerf s why so because though i am not a baron by birth my real name is at least danglars well what then while his name is not morcerf how not morcerf not the least in the world go on i have been made a baron so that i actually am one he made himself a count so that he is not one at all impossible listen my dear count m de morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty years				1168.2308312015539
why it is with him i am also going to fight said porthos				9.507087044590113
no replied d artagnan piqued and thanks to my eyes i can see what other people can not see whether porthos understood him or did not understand him giving way to his anger monsieur said he you stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub musketeers in this fashion chastised monsieur said d artagnan the expression is strong it is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face ah pardieu i know full well that you don t turn your back to yours and the young man delighted with his joke went away laughing loudly				36533.268284388665

you my dear chevalier d herblay he said are the fronde incarnate				1212845.818207282

but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château d if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery				2442322.17104554
he had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation				2143485.5032578185
no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows				359.12972762034263
no i am lost do not be lost with me				13.033171094522428
but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously				96436.93168446372
why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual				2933272.403572372
my friend continued morrel you named the fifth of october as the end of the period of waiting today is the fifth of october he took out his watch it is now nine o clock i have yet three hours to live be it so said the count come morrel mechanically followed the count and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it				13.636285861335285
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required				263649.31451085955
an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel				527.118079615461
oh said porthos there is quite a gap between that fate and the baronial coronet you promised me d artagnan bah				6462.948418827975
sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant and what do you think of her personal appearance oh i consider her perfectly lovely she is just my idea of what medora must have been franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company				7227.143421740799
by her step she must be young perhaps she is pretty				12201134.409257721
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars née hermine de servieux albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friend s conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the count s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess				1672481.02492851
madame replied de winter provided i can find some of my good old friends of former times i will answer for anything come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much come and may heaven hear you chapter xxxvii				2179.424686143351
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our service then said tréville it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there the king looked at the cardinal				270.38885997951655
i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory				734.6788185093573
he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew monsieur bazin				684.3908463188396
at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean d artagnan upset a man it was too insignificant an occurrence to delay people so eager to get on				78.12448741175596
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake noirtier s eyes demanded the nature of her mission				1948.9026387079946
the count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions				70644.65080288978
oh it is not yet fixed murmured fernand				6245.785344702906
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat				114.3298374320755
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximilian too rich				2941.425224902793
and a comforting one too added d artagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man				1.75818966856395
i will answer them both and contrary to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult				32058.100489017586
withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from mazarin whom he despises				1405013.7293003888
that s unpardonable in a man of your age and who besides has such a pretty wife as yours oh lord				242.47546172870665
yes count returned julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his angels the count s cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth				713.445145200988
but we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little better				605.2638290017138
albert listened with the most profound attention				1073.8184820893377
on the other hand mazarin present at that audience heard very well what those deputies demanded				3305848.616787007
as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister				241.98791499322945
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect				2238.1675716362197
tomorrow at the hôtel field of the cloth of gold a lackey in black and red will wait for your reply oh said d artagnan this is rather warm it appears that milady and i are anxious about the health of the same person				465.2182263263151
as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect				33211.71262805346
in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak				1357.6913925861188
planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by rochefort s servant				442.27898901434554
if it was mme				126.67699147968
germain a glass of sherry and a biscuit				84855.0316727102
have you never heard what oliver cromwell said when he came to paris and was shown the dungeon at vincennes where monsieur de vendome was imprisoned what did he say asked porthos				10.885525878490661
and taking it from felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it				6.052007317995584
well in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you you will bring him then				175.1613568406128
but how can the news be brought to you nothing easier in a game of tennis for example in a game of tennis asked la ramee giving more serious attention to the duke s words				518.0691454998711
the nubian smiled assentingly to his master s words then kneeling on one knee respectfully kissed the hand of the count				634.4269005771823
i thought as much said d artagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts				8559.794867930004
it was mercédès leaning on her son s arm and leaving the house				119.27419463822545
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom				1446376.7872432922
oh the red duke				4356.756872432943
why every day in the trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that for a bullet may break a leg and i am convinced a surgeon would give us more pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head				163.8193701900125
there was a postscript i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent in his convent				3895.9638291304504
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him				56.10685060876355
indeed indeed i did not a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast				439.1180551622249
de chevreuse not only served the queen in her political intrigues but what tormented him still more in her amorous intrigues				77923.36635855382
but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what i am to do for m cavalcanti give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of francs payable at sight on you signed by busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsement of course i immediately counted him over the forty bank notes monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent				1581.5269567403218

no i am sorry to tell you he is perfectly well so much the worse said porthos				11.570810757553982
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said				11.9175270469812
well what do you see from this window				124.26143529540738
monsieur d artagnan is in monsieur dessessart s guards and this gentleman is in the company of monsieur de tréville s musketeers				7036.3761962691315
what have i to do with politics				35278.37563323693
let us say no more on the subject you tell me so i believe you				9.777917938467809
one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting no said athos				4.155447971513685
dantès continued his search				445.0669142186292
at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dantès with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones				8573.340253344417
my lord said athos we admire your devotion to the cause you have espoused in remaining at the head of the army whilst so ill in so much pain one must replied monsieur de bouillon sacrifice one s comfort to the public good but i confess to you i am now almost exhausted				14188.138683875366
if we ever escape together half this treasure is yours if i die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to you but inquired dantès hesitating has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves no no be easy on that score the family is extinct				62444.067795414754
his costume of guardsman in the company of m dessessart ought to be his passport				422791.60051228927

clear sky swift flitting boats and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the château d if seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy				2348.567664626527
the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene				2680.578372539929
we must cut off our hair that the populace may not insult us				64.61786281232385
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple				736052.7342812272
come hither said mazarin in his softest voice i have an order to give you d artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase soon found himself in the study whence they had first set out				109.59781060375643
to whom was this letter addressed to m noirtier rue coq héron no				26.341228365173986
in turning the corner of the rue montmartre in order to reach the rue tiquetonne and the hotel de la chevrette where he had appointed porthos to meet him he saw at one of the windows of the hotel that friend himself dressed in a sky blue waistcoat embroidered with silver and gaping till he showed every one of his white teeth whilst the people passing by admiringly gazed at this gentleman so handsome and so rich who seemed to weary of his riches and his greatness				560598.9771452104
every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile instead of vincennes				3172.462847644229
i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time				695.1846767407048
he escapes us so much the better muttered athos				11.520153683473492
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows				477.02603390207787
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door				563.0367697348128
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh				1649415.1362982779
when to morrow evening if you like at what hour at ten in the evening if that suits you by that time we shall have returned good there continued athos either peace or war will be decided honor at all events will be maintained alas murmured d artagnan our honor as soldiers is lost to us forever d artagnan said athos gravely i assure you that you do me wrong in dwelling so upon that				97.36644792965302
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach				3766.9258037001273
it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same thing is it not nearly it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said beauchamp				47.558063364992925
escape as lord de winter had thought milady s wound was not dangerous				1262.044904616035
you thought to make us unhappy strangers trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no carriages or horses are to be had in your beggarly city				3429.412861645125
yes said dantès do you know him no replied villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators it is a conspiracy then asked dantès who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm				7804.70825020589
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits				66648.20919281489

d artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris				134.9761318135054
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of athos s chamber and that of the park				580.0561141598605

all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel long live the coadjutor long live the queen cried de gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness				69231.1684560737

as to d artagnan he sprang toward jussac himself				285.33600477276354

at length m de tréville himself returned				179.3760780000927
this path was formed in the shape of the figure of thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty				4470.9125832487225
la chesnaye go and see if by rummaging all my pockets you can find forty pistoles and if you can find them bring them to me				10.954856282656714
they went out				41.146956896890806
she tried to go toward the window for air but she could only stretch forth her arms her legs failed her and she sank into an armchair				1645.9948840676293
then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too				1046.2445351631882
in this case he was not the judge but the executioner				590.6996028226221
the perfidious deceiver was as may plainly be perceived already sacrificing in intention the poor girl in order to obtain milady willy nilly				2553343.995213264
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to others she answered by throwing her whole soul into the expression of her countenance and in this manner were the conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless invalid whose body could scarcely be called a living one but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses				10691905.935969945
mazarin turned again to his papers				38841.46249508803
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery				59036.79294108042
after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night				407.6633780619853
positively these four men must be on my side the same evening the cardinal spoke to m de tréville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp				692.4364368613333
come on come on said d artagnan let us keep that paper carefully perhaps i have not thrown away my half pistole				1055754.5002024258
baptiste give me yesterday s paper cried beauchamp				58.75891792328804
then m de tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m de la trémouille to interrogate him himself				173.44258037502843
we ought not therefore i think to act toward a queen so illustrious as your majesty as we should act toward a woman of our lowlier condition				9603.453054716241
monte cristo returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the garden to the street he saw first caderousse who after walking to the end of the garden fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part from where he came in				186.0320126334658
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty				397.9586686029648
gentlemen interrupted albert i think you did not understand that something very serious had passed between m de monte cristo and myself possibly possibly said beauchamp immediately but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your life				300.3246406639136
i will go and discuss the matter with the queen he stopped at the end of the corridor and said i can count upon you gentlemen can i not we do not give ourselves twice over said d artagnan we have given ourselves to you command we shall obey very well then said mazarin enter this cabinet and wait till i come back and turning off he entered the drawing room by another door				134.53090596293262

eh give it to me said the young man				1.841466829046631
humph thought i that looks like my handiwork i fancy i must have mended that skull somewhere or other and in fact it was that unfortunate scotchman parry s brother you know on whom groslow amused himself by trying his strength				113763.41008288016
why i was here only ten or twelve days ago				3491.8065409151423
felton was a puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet				205.5043311110092
the burning marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light				628.9211972034707
grimaud made a sign that he was going away				66.67948199133268
she will soon get over these things so saying madame de saint méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a son in law s respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor renée				492989.88829700585
if you are willing gentlemen i will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you and on what will you sleep said d artagnan				1.0292695754013808
m de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin				1303.4421142702777
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé dantès spoke no more of escape				638.1889354193992
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand				17.243211791183626
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a good natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work you are a singular man said villefort				31.30987324485766
just as he was passing the count s box the door opened and monte cristo came forth				181622.72073477219
there are some situations which men understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow				2636.2138977984423
once in france he turned his course toward paris and reaching paris went straight to rue tiquetonne				16666.37492194662
at this moment the clock of la samaritaine struck six the four friends pleaded an engagement and took leave of m de tréville				21.80562801418742
d artagnan obeyed				42.2280590940857
only to think of it makes my flesh crawl				4228898.059719463
she has taken care for herself at least i hope so for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me				55.03340102990174
really that demoiselle d aubigne is very charming so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished				10478.432290447643
all these gentlemen had been noticed by athos and aramis in the guardhouse and when the two friends were announced they started and exchanged some words in a low tone				393.79033934923535
planchet and bazin shall go				3562.3575348407267
i had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts				465912.4612787785
the travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption but at crèvecœur aramis declared he could proceed no farther				1857.918665174373
but we must not lose time				5350.45103512714
when were you here i was brought up here truly it is worth something you see to have been brought up somewhere you will wait for me then let me reflect a little				206.64941148787747
besides mother remark how vivid his eye how raven black his hair and his brow though so pale is free from wrinkles he is not only vigorous but also young the countess bent her head as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter thoughts				1173.2819612299268
the shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous cardinal mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence				483.7619472923462
you have to do with that woman				399.21173469933217
morrel was dreaming and monte cristo was looking at the dreamer				5328329.214536587
d artagnan was perplexed				3771101.073562613
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace				179386.61609756708
if no obstacle occurs we will both charge together force the enemy s line and throw ourselves into the tyne which we must cross either by fording or swimming if on the contrary any repulse should take place you and your men must fight to the last man whilst we and the king proceed on our road				1222.0452097375362
this time my determination is irrevocably taken				419.36756863584816
never mind renée replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a woman s nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love				581.7147156829653
i was in a hurry to join you and took the road you had already gone by				3120.4202318393377
you promise to become one of the lights of the church				388.0484264262014

a little farther a little farther said the other				102.60865824252548
you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation i have become simple in my tastes and am without passion i hope				942.3019167884738
parry too started and stopped reading				8753464957.746452
the mother was a wretch who struck at us all and at those dear to us yes but the son has done us no harm grimaud who had risen to watch the effect of the shot fell back hopeless wringing his hands				51.536992090207725
is it possible that rochefort has become a better man than i am he said to himself				92.63866013638268
dying in the arms of his children he had been by them laid by the side of his wife who had preceded him in eternity by two years				621.7917729852924
you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matters devil take them let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digestion egad said d artagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousqueton it is a vulgar pleasure but i shoot sometimes that is to say when i am dull and i sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and i shoot rabbits really how very amusing yes replied porthos with a sigh it is amusing d artagnan now no longer counted the sighs				21161.403983944212
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes				32.5881882687543
and we did not surrender no				476.40091856861807
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts				1382.2860283625341
i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure				9744937.266231788
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit				385898.95557801425
a small door close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the servants and masters when they were on foot				184.2798377465089
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man				215.09369477269024
at sight of this man d artagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the door				11.355909658230816
true they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue				7518600.016372884
the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him				3.905266031180063
oh sir exclaimed raoul recognizing the young man as having seen him in the rue cocatrix spare him				3251.8516970928213
i am tired of hearing only of market reports of the end of the month of the rise and fall of spanish funds of haitian bonds				9292.854380205596
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around				2016.6747003060543
do you know where i shall find him near blois				9414.050728168362
above you there is the king above the king there is god however perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him				4.004854299631996
you see my strength fails me you see plainly i can not walk				9733048.848448599
well continued valentine the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair noirtier s breathing came thick and short				13656.18567156341
there is constancy then turning to grimaud he said and thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me grimaud signified his assent				23189.492464988933
that s a frightful place that bastille				712560.2296960569
maximilian said he are your affections disengaged morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment				828.5458721643741
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states				224.5436520299685
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is capable				370.08210976135774
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction				534.3844543692339
you know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor broussel the father of the people really did they said d artagnan				1.0271161796589399
danglars then opened the window				66.7984386371109
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water				1324.8764864429725
it is a very cold one my dear friend said aramis				19.424248666081645
come in my host now then asked albert eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen better than that replied signor pastrini with the air of a man perfectly well satisfied with himself				54.52692728516477
monsieur and dear friend ah yes				302.77683197742533
dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent				1900722.4303875973
but dear friend if you ever need me you know that i am entirely devoted to you thereupon aramis had given him a clasp of the hand and had disappeared under the arcades				5270779.326457823
indeed said maximilian i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all events he has a wonderful power of foretelling any future good ah said valentine in a mournful tone do let me see this man maximilian he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered my poor girl you know him already i know him yes it was he who saved the life of your step mother and her son the count of monte cristo the same ah cried valentine he is too much the friend of madame de villefort ever to be mine the friend of madame de villefort				3.59295423757356
but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash				5952667.376193315
but she had her son				292.171089559997
i must at least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty bottles mercy cried the host if the lackey has drunk only half as much as the master i am a ruined man grimaud is a well bred lackey				64008.460799021195
on arriving at the rue des prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the church				479.14385935835895
during the whole time he was speaking the queen appeared to be well pleased with the coadjutor s harangue but terminating as it did with such a phrase the only one which could be caught at by the jokers anne turned around and directed a glance toward her favorites which announced that she delivered up the coadjutor to their tender mercies				7036440.620444625
well said d artagnan to athos you see my dear friend that this is war to the death athos shook his head				15.53118697329686
i promised you a letter for the director of the academy				5718267.569451433
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent				2864.0006807644368
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty				4384.420580675523
do you come from the end of the world said monte cristo you a journalist the husband of renown				1861092.2751667558
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual prison fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine				324.5297602529409
i have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father				332.93273850044017
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the trademark license is very easy				265.9413497963494
you re welcome sirs				1017845.3483018638
knowest thou not that it is the custom of these soldiers to act thus and that it is usual for the regiment to form themselves into two solid walls when the king goes by friquet counterfeited surprise and twisting his new cap around in his fingers said it is not astonishing for you to know it monsieur broussel who knows everything but as for me by holy truth i did not know it and i thought i would give you good advice you must not be angry with me for that monsieur broussel on the contrary my boy on the contrary i am pleased with your zeal				2088905.340738424

i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom murmured athos and the travelers continued their route				3522.3560461291877
this count of monte cristo is a strange man said emmanuel				1396.3529908128912
then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in france				145.35609143751805
but the sound of the clock had not died away when germain announced his excellency the count of monte cristo the involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerf s narrative had impressed them and albert himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion				3103.1753105654284
they can move their arms they can and that is much				370.70804428616873
a glance threatening and transient as lightning replied to raoul				459.57381374991155
count de guiche said the prince it is a long time since you saw your father remain here with him				15.75988811579896
just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock and they fired the signal agreed upon				523.630631139877
i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken i should be obliged to let them hang you at which i should be most unhappy certainly and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny				2641.913205325844
you were in a cloister said the executioner and you left it to ruin my brother milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees				370.8673459048126
i repeat it d artagnan you are the best one among us i bless and love you my dear son and to think that i couldn t find that out said porthos scratching his head it is so simple but said aramis if i understand rightly we are to kill them all eh athos shuddered and turned pale				106.88937429282738
scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him				3.9479077452052067
had old æolus appeared at this moment he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli and aquilo the heir presumptive to the throne				31224746.5354047
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile you are sagacious i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me you				85.76177306899862
try therefore either to carry me to some place where i may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here				182.07230297109857
he clapped his hands three times the ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an echo				1770477.350955473
i take them then said the lieutenant				119.71013516118896
why replied dantès i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this paper silence exclaimed dantès				88.8652012034713
the barricades had been pushed as far as the palais royal				29.165571029448888
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia				15938582.675519582
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry boxes				2833951.265577195
oh very simply black trousers patent leather boots white waistcoat either a black or blue coat and a long cravat				6160866.722666704

he had passed the night standing and without sleep				710.7212965564291
to dinner said d artagnan				1.0333558335504898
d artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly				7729.39206220478
anybody may possess a five franc piece but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me				17.617893840181463
both raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed				3763.414054505297
it lasted nearly three hours he then heard a noise of something falling and all was silent				325.2172583915149
perhaps to madame de longueville				489.12514161421774
every instant mme				131.09549377604233
louis xiii				5.6672690659802365
noirtier s room was opened like all the rest				316.061137806782
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon				1622.1057759932867
though sinking from moment to moment the wounded man was not yet dead				71.33175598643265
she was forced to return to tours she is not faithless she still loves me				52.50358597937094
you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the pharaon is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship s owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars				10.301251338639505
that is well said mme				24.93312528950149
the secret cave chapter				1.8309571229160635

then following the clew that in the hands of the abbé faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure				1064.8118524095194
behind d artagnan entered porthos aramis lord de winter and the man in the red cloak				1191.7317550328835

he is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his house came first but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne to see raoul				414.3489954553132
the curates asked him what was to be done				68.90692043377604
i am profoundly ignorant of all these stock jobbing intrigues because said albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them ah said the count i see that m danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing francs in a day he must be enormously rich it is not he who plays exclaimed lucien it is madame danglars she is indeed daring but you who are a reasonable being lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountain head surely you ought to prevent it said morcerf with a smile				108.41226402085609
d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or looking indeed as if he had never seen them before				313.18713882789586
but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten that				80.91068021363049
chapter xii				185.68336649987768
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier d herblay two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul but aramis protected him with his sword				130.7362973084586
i have my plan let me carry it out and we shall laugh so much the better said porthos i feel some need of it hush said d artagnan the some one is coming the sound of a light step was heard in the vestibule				43947.37677347614
the lady with the red cushion produced a great effect for she was very handsome upon the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded a great effect upon porthos who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood a great effect upon d artagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady				296.71891100404775
that is all i had to say to you and i reply to you sir that this abuse of power this exile under a fictitious name are infamous would you like better to be hanged in your true name milady				250.60622083222563

aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of athos				38.21416880455196
this affair made a great noise				1400.2502131281165

alas do you love nothing else in me asked d artagnan				1.0283089879638272
monte cristo on stepping into the house heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw mercédès seated with her head bowed and weeping bitterly				323.0654452053842
upon this promise d artagnan withdrew and the next day he began service				2199.891186607498
what i have done then has been for the queen and not at all for your grace				19838.52381958453

madame said he i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity				1593752.5785842082
my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body				742.2441769147899

as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo				1866.071059236935

he hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious smile at a paragraph headed we hear from yanina very good observed danglars after having read the paragraph here is a little article on colonel fernand which if i am not mistaken would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me perfectly unnecessary at the same moment that is at nine o clock in the morning albert de morcerf dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of monte cristo s house in the champs élysées				83.46130935484913
father said benedetto i am asked for proofs do you wish me to give them no no it is useless stammered m de villefort in a hoarse voice no it is useless how useless cried the president what do you mean i mean that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me				2301.0905880495006

haydée took the porcelain cup in her little slender fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes				8050226.494101023
i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile as though in mockery of my words				746.2942310820189
i will perpetuate the crime and punishment by making a frightful example				2631.6848893274114
the prince awaited him there				248.2067825625726
and follow me wherever i go to the world s end then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god				3281.5596923251037

bazin who had been standing listening to all this controversy with a pious jubilation sprang toward them took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the jesuit and walked respectfully before them to clear their way				712.7130765712966
he was obliged to let himself down by his hands and from a height of fifty feet				602.8888923360171
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france				142.13551172932986
and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the honor of your visit i alluded to so much the better				336.62040414180217
the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition				7224.717724854817
one of us would suffice really my dear monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence and bernouin do i not take him with me there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish my lord there is time to draw back said d artagnan and your eminence is perfectly free not at all not at all said mazarin let us be off and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of d artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling				25760.046138653328
she did not know whether the abbess was a royalist or a cardinalist she therefore confined herself to a prudent middle course				9366.158947492288
because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride				3455.7695465105
oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my arrest the carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed				873.3355041057126
addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested				27409284.504810613
i say that he is ill informed				4488127.02780879
they both came immediately m morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet				4402855.3185863225
m d avrigny warned me of it				22.173617453428225
the tie is even more direct it seems to me oh madame said villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the marchioness				2466663.814797107
write to me at paris to m joannes in the palais royal arcade pierre no				43.862113115907526
they might not be satisfied and ah ha thought danglars this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned				7598555.079605107
i have proof that her majesty notwithstanding her excellent heart has more than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his eminence persons who had served her trust me madame the queen may appear to have abandoned those persons but we must not put faith in appearances				1259041.461032223
in what can i have offended her i who ever since i have known her have lived at her feet like a slave				1315.3700627126716
we must play the game to the end and consent to be blindfolded ah you shall see i promise you i will sustain my part to admiration i never once doubted your doing so monte cristo chose this moment for re entering the drawing room				46.94695443764231
besides his intention was formed to make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies but without meanness or weakness fearing that might result from this duel which generally results from an affair of this kind when a young and vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened if conquered he doubles the triumph of his antagonist if a conqueror he is accused of foul play and want of courage				815.9587669076949
so preferring death to capture i accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great care we take of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution				2395.834750780941
i have remarked also another thing said athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched				4789529.547562449
mistrust everything in short even your own shadow fortunately said d artagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have i hope only men to dread in the meantime said athos i renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go i will go with you				29.45140714237698
assuming a dignified air she turned round to debray without answering her husband				228.8599483307444
the carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and square				3413345.1604661345
madame said he				14.83020887523323
i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musketoon				2113306.989525843
gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice i must name myself				260.9265695755363
i pardieu and you would arrest him why not you would arrest the duc de beaufort armed in the field if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in so would i said porthos				14.247129020913778
a few hundred yards beyond the town d artagnan drew rein				6631769.3851706395
i really never heard a person speak as you do because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us why should they not				101.57230721846234
the blood rose to her head and her little foot worked with impatience beneath her robe				11078.940811302034
we will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice box you see plainly that i have no sword said the englishman				21.22404576788527
thanks to the attentions of raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him				7.1104005643911545
on leaving paris athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger				4215.925310715779
what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combine them				42.20887393349874
or the mysterious benefactress said athos				3.3480344000860067
however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master				529.72547165943
really sir you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished notary turning to m de villefort				5.681388915451573
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity				3780.6089777383822
is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon if i were sole owner we d shake hands on it now my dear dantès and call it settled but i have a partner and you know the italian proverb chi ha compagno ha padrone he who has a partner has a master but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes				1254643.734223786
the ball was not a musket ball it was an arquebus ball				14772.575933014783
for some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs exclamations and prayers				1384233.9292851463
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea				12922.390279230001
really i like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him yes he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort indeed and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars said albert laughing				32.88134179947151
i am sure you would not have forced me to come				590.9145542405197
thus i was able thanks to the strategic disposition of my forces to intercept two couriers from mazarin to the queen mazarin listened intently				19353968.57133751
upon my soul that future captain of mine is a lucky dog				367566.3474622389
this time franz could contain himself no longer but sank half fainting into a seat				669.7111017099047
yes yes war said anne of austria				78.26042874091961
i won t hold my tongue replied caderousse i say i want to know why they should put dantès in prison i like dantès dantès your health and he swallowed another glass of wine				193.04618089766427
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter				399.3851894099166
they opened it and found francs in bank scrip				1689962.0595176832
the president read mr				579068.7467818713
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself				1118.994138994505
is that monsieur said d artagnan to himself				60.16766411079009
be it so said athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people				890.8926435414785
this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs d eau c est bien prouvé par le déluge you said sir you would like to help me but yes but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die death alone can separate them remarked fernand				7795.342948072749
spur your horses				1398.4152653124877
come come do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the corsican who to my mind has usurped quite enough nay madame i would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal that of robespierre on his scaffold in the place louis quinze that of napoleon on the column of the place vendôme				1876163.0937488386
one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle				148449.3406614399
grimaud nodded assent				381657.0676550452
if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior				1620452.3005150019
she asked upon what day this fête would take place but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head				134.00533338304993
yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter and crossing his arms				170.443667492332
thy god shall teach thee to repent				917479.3721396681

dantès himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb and with his fine countenance radiant with joy and happiness a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined				1414.7090959398813
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that d artagnan had not come to béthune				313264.23741994373
once more replied the major				210.604963754439
i know that it is terrible said d artagnan but when i reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scene again before me as if i now were there				122.47297766871404
monsieur she said i i do not understand you and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions				6956997.601747793
god pardon me cried buckingham i really think he threatens me no my lord i still plead				5139723.694568483
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach house				205.8612339286335
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis				1696.4767183345023
i am on the earth to punish madame he added with a flaming glance any other woman were it the queen herself i would send to the executioner but to you i shall be merciful				8566185.821900912

so that now continued caderousse he owns a magnificent house no				231.30353010645428
mazarin pretended to laugh				879.9728142515766
in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her				9.91815421103253
m de tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning only when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre and that he might repair at once to his post				164649.7383792658
here you decide then nothing about me my lord on the contrary i have come to a decision bernouin came into the room				687.1635098033504
certainly certainly cried franz				46.44618207814201
i am acquainted with it before we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been disciplined d artagnan said aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance d artagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs				14977.017187949807
tis an unfortunate year for kings said the mother				2372.190934462838
remember to go to the count on the may at seven o clock in the evening				120.43320173830274
except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europe the english the spanish and the german the countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed				2911150.5887715267
it is then buckingham cried felton in a high state of excitement				3557.5332001305933
he was yielding to your infernal influence but i will save him				4.684719489899218
you know about that cried athos astonished				28.384786888551684
this cost me on your account and mine francs				736.2099182830885
why said aramis one half were hanged and the other half were shot well i said d artagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot				62477.06793445308
he ordered the carriage therefore for eleven o clock desiring signor pastrini to inform him the moment that albert returned to the hotel				2861.778245856424
it was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the beautiful and proud anne of austria and in making himself loved by dazzling her				11041.30645475896
i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m d épinay that is right said the old man				1.8997721243291148
save me porthos and aramis arose				668.8845135077263
all at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers she counted two then five then eight horsemen				662.7254347248269
till we meet again then dear traitor till we meet again my forgetful charmer tomorrow my angel tomorrow flame of my life chapter xxx				434.5969377253656
heigh sir said d artagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouse evading women				4451.813321291641
grimaud s first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour s riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe				2753518.5415126816
where she was known as la belle provençale she was the widow of the marquis de castellane when she married de ganges and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothers in law was forced by them to take poison and they finished her off with pistol and dagger ed				6995.868415763451
well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well				479.88605889686715
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered				2865.2519003424313
oh thank you a thousand times				30949.753559718683
we will wait for these gentlemen so please you i have plenty of time and it will be more correct				40407.261722202
well my dear porthos said d artagnan that s the very thing it came into my head to do athos understood all now				454.51102200249215
impossible madame impossible edmond said the poor mother who tried every means when i call you edmond why do you not call me mercédès mercédès repeated monte cristo mercédès				4359.778551834149
oh sir i beg your pardon exclaimed raoul ashamed of so much attention in an instant i shall be dressed athos then called olivain				973.3669527997646
felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest you will hear me to the end my lord				71.84817458583565
pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace				44477.07759250607
what are you going to do cried mme				21.066280934376174
you must be aware that for our undertaking company would be in the way that s true said the guardsman astonished that his name had not produced more effect upon the young man				2.5064196723860785
chapter xxxvi				129.61626104457673
i am not willing that a compatriot a handsome cavalier a brave youth quite fit to make his way should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it				17.04172500807139
then he drew from his waistcoat pocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand				17.368291321571068
take care of your horses cried d artagnan to him				70.76881853734652
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a man s head inside the carriage				85.673568343227
this clever person is your relative then cousin german go on to your cousin then aramis continued my dear cousin his eminence the cardinal whom god preserve for the happiness of france and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom is on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of la rochelle				185.22652800031668
do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison ah monsieur de rochefort				68.37638805705686
charles perceived it and took his hand				25.568982001074748
what do you say inquired charles rising				2148696.3270661407
everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently				3265804.7293045456
as for the count of monte cristo he had never for an instant shown any appearance of having been moved				1957.3385263944817
but pardon said d artagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man s shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing mordaunt stopped short				36383.16957070476
it is not of my wife i hope on the contrary it is of her				106.50027464094026
will your majesty deign to excuse me speak sir speak boldly replied louis				115377150.33780478
what do you want sir said the king				17.42905360661869
for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy				2112051.764141084
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all				336.7292496287483
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances d artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once				19610.614520510302
it seems like a woman				536.8910630321271
the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz				384.6036361020606
what have you done with monsieur de beaufort he is in vendome where he will wait until i write to him to return to paris write to him now s the time you are sure of your enterprise yes but he must make haste for hardly will the people of paris have revolted before we shall have a score of princes begging to lead them				35.14088517942126
think what a figure you will make when you are asked how do they execute at rome and you reply i do not know and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son				283.21190877145756
hasten reverend sir hasten				1203022.9729102594
have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots				2933264.0114247142
at sight of him madame de villefort uttered an expression of pleasure and holding the child still closer towards her she said edward dearest do you see that good man				304.1690572808211
monsieur du vallon yonder is rich and has forty thousand francs yearly so he does not care about money				1223.4375294526046
i shall obey the wishes of the people				365.275699152253
as for the count he had fallen on his chair it was evident that his legs refused to support him				3.7692207997057094
now said she listen to me the request was needless				184592.50346309398
no my lord these places are bought				8371086.691402816
as he struck the wall pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off and fell to the ground in flakes exposing a large white stone				703.3863371057399
my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar				1003.0627332347566
have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence				513.5112680018296
we will not venture to say whether it was from terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends so closely united				269601.3612167915
and the drawers yes those at the side no the middle one yes valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers				5443.090470100686
edmond opened his eyes complained of great pain in his knee a feeling of heaviness in his head and severe pains in his loins				150399.0254405581
aramis if that is all it is easily done said porthos				14.132014354047033
what do you think of monsieur de tréville telling me when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday that you associated with the suspected english whom the cardinal protects that is to say i visit an englishwoman the one i named oh ay				3671233.7031876757
but what must i do asked milady				38.43572221743567
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son				2840.543696636326
speak said athos				4.198886872960757
he had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion				667276.141036779
as for himself he dismounted and remained under a beautiful group of chestnuts in flower amidst which were murmuring a multitude of happy bees and bade olivain send the host to him with writing paper and ink to be placed on a table which he found there conveniently ready				10513.686851924425
my english horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth				262.69355908521413
a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man s shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size				17539666.124633886
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him				6.985907203790056
and then resumed d artagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following				24698.508555578428
the leave of absence monsieur has asked for replied the lackey				119135.7405406218
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse				3607.616464641136
that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvre all which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham				153.7898885544534
you are the king of lackeys				2992395.676420786
this then continued aramis was my first opinion but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquired eh my friend aramis paused				403.743440818311
yes the gascon answered athos				4.268406359026543
meantime d artagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king				54.876383564963795
he would take advantage of the first moment of surprise shame and terror to triumph over her				97.16928265323335
idole de mon âme i was the first to discover duprez at naples and the first to applaud him				6.667292241061446
it was almost broad daylight				34055.7707525688
here and there on the walls of the staircase were reflected gigantic shadows which trembled in the flickering light of the pine torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above				16225.320715170516
see the state in which he has put me oh my lord cried the baron i shall never console myself and you would be quite wrong my dear de winter said buckingham holding out his hand to him				10.511111820723462
he could not see it but he felt its presence				1307.4372015053837
desrues was however i must confess more skilful what would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we can				490.60443894663973
oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence ah really said monte cristo in a half stifled voice				54.73899539628277
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa he therefore went forward without a moment s hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half				901.2936322492192
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne				10212937.718616225
the cardinal folded and sealed his letter				210.69898185292266
the night was one of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through dantès mind				436.35511763690084
what s the matter at the château d if said the captain				97.15626369265217
or a tiger ali bowed his head in token of assent				1834.3496892008172
the president called for the indictment revised as we know by the clever and implacable pen of villefort				306.3141723724481
my place of abode is no				328.98994353415577
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man possibly thought d artagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarin s compliment				32629.777659094267
maximilian s avowal at the same moment m de villefort s voice was heard calling from his study what is the matter morrel looked at noirtier who had recovered his self command and with a glance indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances he had taken refuge				3315.1065400889547
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a plot				16061599.125840828
i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something				754.3769391017053
de monte cristo appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our family if such be the case my dear valentine you must yourself have felt or at all events will soon feel the effects of his presence				529.8826076754448
morrel is in his room is he not mademoiselle julie said the cashier				2354513.029264855
look attentively then at this gentleman the old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on morrel				156.6436057619103
she turned toward the wall to smile for there was in this smile such an expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her				13.739102075528615
think for a moment				346.7464120777542
no sir				52.377520285851574
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance				1496285.5913891587
what we are going to say does not concern your majesty the king smiling turned a few steps back				248.05864730586697
instead of performing your part of this contract as i performed mine you bought me from the scotch cheaply i know and that does honor to the economic talent of your government				8389.13557938161
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation s website and official page at www gutenberg org contact section				108992.70329641666
the enemy s army extended from cassel to courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them				18.99359034592805
barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string				13315.309857490645
and madame de villefort cried baptistin				1818.4784692192447
first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle you				116.47527114163444
unfortunately edmond s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular				298368.57306195184
then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his francs and the other livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon				34990.787105386284
ever since valentine s dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad				98513.57158124298
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript				4607499.754402068
what vessel is that asked milady				37.53199744320789
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg				6131687.997201031
well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another				167.35290556873412
madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles				4910.393048464603
did he allude to his hope of being captain he spoke of it as a thing already decided indeed said danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me why it seems m morrel has promised him the thing so that he is quite elated about it why yes he is actually insolent over the matter has already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker which you refused most assuredly although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now m dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance he is about to become a captain pooh said danglars he is not one yet ma foi it will be as well if he is not answered caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to him if we choose replied danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he is what do you mean nothing i was speaking to myself				185.51017311563257
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz				31.110786686807497
at nine o clock the next morning the drums beat to arms				1291.1808098562233
the lady was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her				9.402065180118782
i ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like you porthos without reply retreated a second step				659.0650997054789
you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo smiling				13.660551205524742
when the game was over the duke laughing at la ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis d or to go and drink his health with their four other comrades				239484.0060076505
how should he be replied athos whilst mounting also seeing he was used so long to brush your hats chapter lxxvi				3789678.945375801
i can see neither heaven nor earth said the jeweller who was outside the door				67.86424208549806
it was midnight				12836.252180416443
the jailer advanced dantès appeared not to perceive him				4.211348409241751
he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague				4707636.34610717
everything said he to raoul shall be done as you desire but you will not stop to have your wound dressed oh my wound mine tis nothing replied the viscount it will be time to think about it when we next halt only have the goodness should you see a cavalier who makes inquiries about a young man on a chestnut horse followed by a servant to tell him in fact that you have seen me but that i have continued my journey and intend to dine at mazingarbe and to stop at cambrin				2146545.7896488737
during the last five or six months that this weakness had been felt the worthy procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife				206.6242857953484
it is for you replied a gendarme				1158.3130112436077

never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me				6.411977003840043
at the same time through the streets of grenelle saint honore and du coq a double stream of people broke the feeble hedge of swiss guards and came like a whirlwind even to the very legs of porthos s horse and that of d artagnan				1.0509532677851443
then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold valentine the count smiled				55.55328039980357

signor luigi continued albert is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your excellency none sir replied the bandit you are as free as air well then a happy and merry life to you				42.1132896470412
every door was opened to him				7.102293410821052
the concierge who attended him had only been there since				19384.565529421412
he darted a preparatory glance at athos and aramis who slyly pushed their chairs a little back so as to leave themselves more space for action				27248.69544297097
they sailed edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in prison				614.6827853143047
the king advanced toward madame the president with whom he was to dance and his highness monsieur with the queen				44.35444650324997

unfold your plan my lord and we will see take notice that you are shut up captured you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource what that of dying together mazarin shuddered				515.8028805407549
d artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three his paleness terrified athos who however consented himself with saying that s a sad throw comrade you will have the horses fully equipped monsieur the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice				4618.728796798473
i am not in any want thank god my living is suited to my means				2029.6152856383208
i would fain fix the source of it on man that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon earth my father and mercédès come said the abbé closing his hiding place and pushing the bed back to its original situation let me hear your story dantès obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the account of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the death of captain leclere and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal his interview with that personage and his receiving in place of the packet brought a letter addressed to a monsieur noirtier his arrival at marseilles and interview with his father his affection for mercédès and their nuptual feast his arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de justice and his final imprisonment in the château d if				15.96041446742752
the king looked around him				3.980319452704873
besides an old soldier always likes to march with as little baggage as possible that is just the case precisely so but you are a man of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you				28.465671555436064
much monsieur mordaunt would care				6844.656048291644
gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it				11.984040675538516
i have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which d artagnan traveled				3750864.6632788344
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance				40818.35320038485
you know there are different sorts that tall harsh looking man is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute				4267173.943019814
edward raised his head looked at his mother and then finding that she did not confirm the order began cutting off the heads of his leaden soldiers				803.6912542158385
this lady was the daughter of nicholas de camus who arrived in paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself				39.195462272859764
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges guitant and villequier mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man				1199.8290281216603
the result was that when the new comer left the hotel with the cicerone a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers and without having been seen by the traveller and appearing to excite no attention from the guide followed the stranger with as much skill as a parisian police agent would have used				1679.7659065926646
before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a movement not a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him				3.598749276438357
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne				12581.759622564561
i am taken shouted athos with all the power of his lungs				184399.8390409043
you are mistaken i am not the count of monte cristo then who are you i am he whom you sold and dishonored i am he whose betrothed you prostituted i am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortune i am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger i am he whom you also condemned to starvation and who yet forgives you because he hopes to be forgiven i am edmond dantès danglars uttered a cry and fell prostrate				11061.964183830532
it was the same through which twenty four years ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the houses today so smiling and animated were on that night dark mute and closed				550.0679986257405
milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it				16.542218872782442
we are observed they are coming to meet us				50.81190241652434
we shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escalade				852136.7684991643
now let me try on the dress of yonder chap				2759828.0632234723
allow me then sire to intercede for her with your majesty let her humble herself then and come to me first on the contrary sire set the example				823.1010500284277
stop stop cried he whom they had addressed as my lord tis not his voice ah				108.18344531076475
i forgot to ask you where are you taking me to the cardinal what does he want with me i do not know				108.3928801305038
who could these men be				572.8036696602967
he turned and saw julie				2280.8558026717833
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind				615.676035699338
but they are calling me				15.1750286092032
the youths spurred on				204.85723230016075
then d artagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers				491.76544330853994
now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper				4087.719412548441
if perchance m de morcerf came he would find m cavalcanti in that room where he the betrothed of eugénie has never been admitted you may well say perchance replied the banker for he comes so seldom it would seem only chance that brings him but should he come and find that young man with your daughter he might be displeased he				602.7003350624565
i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled				87491.61245938498
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel				1345.4848833123094
but we must be going the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris followed by mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm				5791435.99060566
indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brother in law but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you				13.874128733063927
is there anything new in the wind nothing i thought perhaps that the king s death has only hastened their flight in ten minutes they will perhaps be here what have you come for then to embark with you ah				141.0874514204398
my sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two setters				3350506.0882178913
go on monsieur bertuccio said the count				6.939302474847367
at this moment a patrol passed by				6879.280718016809
five minutes later he came down the grand staircase you followed him cried athos				5.168628901200305
dead animosities				132984.63731222248
monsieur the comte de la fere whose family is allied to the montmorency and the rohan is easily the equal of monsieur de mazarin no matter said d artagnan in his most wheedling tone				244.44773003954484
at the denunciating sound the monks would be rendered aware that temptation was besieging a brother and all the community would go to prayers				3788804.4293805133
he questioned him and as the boy had no interest in deceiving d artagnan learned that he exercised from six o clock in the morning until nine the office of chorister and from nine o clock till midnight that of a waiter in the tavern				97978.20208185141
i am sorry to have had anything to do with this matter				342.7933150617925
you said prince did you not				41.534804732472764
the hand of god caderousse continued to call piteously help reverend sir help what is the matter asked monte cristo				1.0396931152636861
he s a fine looking fellow said another if he had only a comb and hair grease he d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids his coat looks nearly new and his boots are brilliant				30655.99667741425
for the rest he was dumb blind and deaf and of unimpeachable fidelity				1685884.6175988708
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay				2135.05941015205
you can sign it yes yes said caderousse and his eyes glistened at the thought of this posthumous revenge				115454.79311786995
it is you who with that mandate obtained the pasha s ring which gave you authority over selim the fire keeper				6062.890005699754
and prince cavalcanti sang with mademoiselle eugénie yesterday				145403.24463372113
yes let us go to the library please the marquis took his arm and they left the salon				1150.9464049651983
will you sell him to me for that sum no but i will play for him what at dice no sooner said than done and i lost the horse				575.7767755778561
d arminges and olivain and the two grooms then mounted their horses and all four started off at a quick trot to rejoin raoul and his companion				3355.74854449923
yes if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty as you are and who may hope for everything being handsome and brave as you are wretch cried d artagnan speak quickly				1577.4388275287617
the poor girl ventured a glance at d artagnan which said see how i suffer on your account toward the end of the evening however the beautiful lioness became milder she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of d artagnan and even gave him her hand to kiss				1884.1698396122028
on the contrary i take you to be a worthy and accomplished gentleman				7694.24466595782
to the deputation it was formally announced that the queen would receive it				7.487865145164299
are you no longer my master or have i ceased to be your slave monte cristo returned her smile				156.84510890959768
in the name of heaven sir cried she what means all that is passing				42433.16058450004
and you shall be alone replied the young man				1.753817981992589
you played very willingly with us without knowing our names said athos by the same token that you won our horses that is true but we then only risked our pistoles this time we risk our blood				583.7286672781479
mon dieu said the woman crossing herself				1186.1141290740613
you know the vessel is lost the pharaon sir they signal the pharaon				824.4896550898526
i had provided myself with a dark lantern				497466.66141586966
imponite manus and not manum place the hands not the hand place the hands repeated the curate with a gesture				446.897496567501
in one hand she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her face and in the other a bottle of english smelling salts				1874986.1375181132
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us all replied mordaunt				81.88098264668706
after breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit				695.560356253696
saved said the girl saved by the crew of the vessel that has just entered the harbor morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and sublime gratitude				4489.293106361888
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart				23.513464702087408
this idea occurred to me and did not leave me it is of this homicidal thought that i now bear the punishment continue continue said felton i am eager to see you attain your vengeance oh i resolved that it should take place as soon as possible				176.458410263768
the conduct of the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that château renaud did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion				2086.0334610596333
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and happy oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is i who promise this then turning to d artagnan she said sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received				341.15906116187824
at this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name				907.0865631370425
since his first arrival at paris he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man whom he had always found worthy loyal and great				35282.850579770966
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if i had employed it for another purpose i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy				1390295.9006882757
d artagnan he cried				40.59261289004479
the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now useless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell				801.5361814648724
the house was of white stone and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers				407.6812622465595
for women have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but i who only understand my own figures know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me				9.765858896483737
he had friends then after five years in prison				989.8981720256862
i say sire that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty it is probable that i am in error				5650.739078709201
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to d elbeuf				571323124.5114771
i imagined it must be said morrel				60.09119603961663
whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody else				510.5696374441285
as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission the young man s eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself				46.92456253401568
directly afterwards the moon rose				23564.851992820935
march forward but eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of henry iv				39.692882681363535
ay said porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan i have none said athos but d artagnan will discover one d artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded				705.2677638170605
i read it a little while since				410347.98330852477
he is a proud soul he is a man by himself				51.515186611340994
she had succeeded d artagnan was then in her power				683.3688512287446
he credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends				81.39749057976691
i see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing room				52.7562636011637
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way				589.5962162873175
it is ali cried albert in the midst of the general surprise				972.9103485981045
oh you are an angel exclaimed the young man				1.611043587024447
i have only two adversaries i will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even them they are time and distance				7760.065868728083
oh said monte cristo i allow of no excuse				5537.640189763322
the window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio				6669017.671501254
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past				235733.37904655238
d artagnan rushed out of the room				36.712768810112316
don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies d artagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocation whence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard				550.9106034113099
after several blows he perceived that the stones were not cemented but had been merely placed one upon the other and covered with stucco he inserted the point of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with joy soon saw the stone turn as if on hinges and fall at his feet				102.12200756253274
what the devil are you doing there cried the two friends				89.79245003628478
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert s side				701.1922206980743
i love her and i ask god and you how i can save her monte cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion				170976.12621353168
is he not peculiar he is more than that replied château renaud he is one of the most extraordinary men i ever saw in my life				232.0657021976211
then as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions my brother went and hid himself on the road of the catholic and i on that of the huguenot				82184.72834459288
the comte de la fere can not be far off only the doors are locked that is a slight difficulty said porthos and a good push with the shoulders for god s sake porthos my friend reserve your feats of strength or they will not have when needed the honor they deserve				62186.50509422118
besides a signal made half a league out at sea and to which la jeune amélie replied by a similar signal indicated that the moment for business had come				223.4017648365714
why this evening said the abbess today even				3636239.391247061
while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate				1463.4386394785
my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me right dantès quite right				223.82219300446118
monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter				1604.8995688094103
and do you not perceive that in the person of this priest is represented the whole people of paris and that it is dangerous to insult him at this moment and if this priest wished it in an hour you would be without a crown				411440.4863333891
tis your fault you simpleton answered the duke				11.39460275816893
your excellency s carriage is at the door said he				19.60849941165559
by whom by the gentleman who was here yesterday				3190.7378474597112
at herlier planchet who led the column turned to the left				458.27133051750155
monsieur mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please chapter lxix				7202061.709517975
oho said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven				254340.5135256379
either i misunderstand you or you are very shameless you only speak thus because you are overheard coolly replied milady and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me my jailers and my hangmen				1276269.6651523192
at the first word the cardinal spoke of mme				54.93783212408634
are we softened a little				287.1313469455664
all this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital				6280.5482394768715
as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party discontented sir				435.7500528540597
although in justice the people who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you that is not the custom excellency said peppino				381.84816655566567
