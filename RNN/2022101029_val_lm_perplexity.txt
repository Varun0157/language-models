what exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the law these advocates to promote your majesty s welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that i would not make anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her				147.19508611914017
whom does this belong to he inquired				8158.0745511993955
thus you see though born in paris i was brought up in corsica there was a moment s silence during which one could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness				31712.84737064554
i was brought here by night so devil take me if i know where i am well said comminges suppose one thing i will suppose anything you please suppose there were a window in this wall well from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his the count then is in the chateau yes for what reason the same as yourself athos a prisoner you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because there is no prison don t let us play upon words sir				476.66268529893784
contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute				485803.3858369253
i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses				1812.8837759728854
but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against you				27.512128179097264
and follow me wherever i go to the world s end then take my arm and let us on we have no time to lose the young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome proud and powerful as a god				868.0043513750541
two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would				5013.606585204802
before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition				58144.13173238807
but listen to me listen and you will pity me who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief i am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon you oh you frighten me				40.08552287356753
each word that fell from his companion s lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth				3646.377356130301
porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of d artagnan and his yellow horse				1365.6028953157745
do you doubt my word he said				426.2870044314821
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme				90.99184108176746
her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion				3188.37741139454
monsieur baptistin said the count you have been in my service one year the time i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me				352.2448312172318
it seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined oh				589.2713064043606
monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested i shall be delighted to have your opinion the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied d artagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen the two men in black bowed in their turn				1643.3151617728029
as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in				665.3417937947513
now madame nothing remains to me except to proffer my respectful homage said chatillon who felt confused and ashamed beneath the stern gaze of athos				205.02844537043717
see if he is still in the same place athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole				131781.4800161021
monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilian s room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still				4009.191011100495
now she thought they could not long delay coming to clear the table and that felton would then reappear				61240.96232980283
mordaunt rapidly sprang back a step				3041.6457082747165
i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces				129436.85176519274
at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly				202075.81730079962
now that never happened to us when we were four together				1638.3195245261181
but now it is different i have lost all that bound me to life death smiles and invites me to repose i die after my own manner i die exhausted and broken spirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand times round my cell that is thirty thousand steps or about ten leagues no sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his power ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at pleasure like a worn out garment				155382.2981374936
you have forgotten it porthos said he				25.007536666437286
almost an impossibility replied the major				3270.34697618591
my dear athos he said i am going away				666.6765733727939
so dressed he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom				4293.234475423475
i will bless you i i am dying cried mordaunt come to me				42.111753464685954
and as the man approached d artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern				28010.520885060243
to you as the king s attorney i denounce mademoiselle de villefort do your duty doctor i resist no longer i can no longer defend myself i believe you but for pity s sake spare my life my honor m				515.0812649028161
you have once before thrown yourself in my path				49492.48082760956
you are a worthy fellow and i had already thought of your interests in the event of poor edmond having become captain of the pharaon is it possible you were so kind yes indeed i had previously inquired of dantès what was his opinion of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you and what was his reply that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship s owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured danglars				147.59922139553294
she opened it quickly and read go this moment to the allées de meilhan enter the house no				914.0474985124616
haydée s only reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir the framework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young girl s picturesque attitude and appearance				1614.1215163699924
his fine eyes no longer surrounded by that dark line which nights of dissipation pencil too infallibly seemed larger more liquid than ever				2750.062059444761
you must have much reason to complain of him not very much said d artagnan				1.5009715692916032
the monk cried the host where is the monk grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard				2946.095314797899
you come from the queen said mazarin looking fixedly at d artagnan				3.5883151730800127
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleon s secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villefort s plot				74266.83532051335
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly				337413.0188178865
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry re ascended to his wife s chamber and found d artagnan just recovering his senses				8735.89180107583
do you understand me cried monte cristo				6.087218262225265
art thou a messenger from god art thou a minister from hell art thou an angel or a demon callest thou thyself eloa or astarte do you not know me felton				776.3574286249127
it is miserable do you see always to wait till the end of the month oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting				10064.524353368704

there was no peculiar indication in any organ an excitement of the nervous system that was it a case of cerebral congestion nothing more				1662.8097270442
but i was going to tell you that i met m de morcerf the other day well monsieur franz is his friend you know what then monsieur de morcerf has received a letter from franz announcing his immediate return valentine turned pale and leaned her hand against the gate				1882.8998705378685
the last count of spada moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained no no make your mind satisfied on that point				1378.9667101630203
pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance				2268.1804103702093
since daybreak la ramee had been occupied with the preparations and trusting no one but himself he had visited personally the successor of pere marteau				291596.99547033024
her face as she looked at athos had taken on an expression that can not be described				7733.727615437067
that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding evening				544.570975307092
her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern woman would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after effect				2644.085928617648
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan				3355.054153162696
well then marie michon had supper with her follower and then in accordance with the permission given her she entered the chamber of her host kitty meanwhile taking possession of an armchair in the room first entered where they had taken their supper really monsieur said madame de chevreuse unless you are the devil in person i don t know how you could become acquainted with all these details a charming woman was that marie michon resumed athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas				17633.259010392372
the cardinal there awaited louis xiii				2052.078316985496
at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared				19215.947778696773
the court of his hôtel situated in the rue du vieux colombier resembled a camp from by six o clock in the morning in summer and eight o clock in winter				1043.1047630547473
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope				2174.8299014897925
oh yes she said i saw but i can not believe would you rather die then and cause maximilian s death oh repeated the young girl almost bewildered can i not leave the house can i not escape valentine the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere your servants will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape				178512.66962191596
the porter knew him and let him pass only calling to him in his study monsieur procureur in his study villefort pushed or rather forced the door open				2559.389842026922
he took a seat and quietly awaited the arrival of the notary				2162.732382560671
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m de morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society of which he is the brightest ornament said beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne				35446.592087630524
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom house officers				5273.310324902109
all faithful hearts with me cried out winter				417.0845486021384
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after you how so i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majesty s ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor d artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues				11075.359617483015
undeceive yourself comrade you are not monsieur de tréville my faith replied d artagnan recognizing athos who after the dressing performed by the doctor was returning to his own apartment				708.2911540422014
the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head				455.3739831672744
our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada				178476.41155667815
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt				39615.24807826589
well it is a question of serving the king the gentleman s duty but the king is with mazarin he is but not willingly in appearance not heart and that is exactly the snare the king s enemies are preparing for the poor child ah				354.2379601585912
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected				140606.2567366685
life is the greatest treasure and speaking candidly ours hangs by a thread what do you say to this du vallon i said porthos i am entirely of d artagnan s opinion this is a beastly country this england you are quite decided then to leave it asked athos of d artagnan				238.72237496575403
then as in leaving the cabaret they took different directions my brother went and hid himself on the road of the catholic and i on that of the huguenot				140373.93235729184
because monsieur replied kitty my mistress loves you not at all hein said d artagnan can she have charged you to tell me so oh no monsieur but out of the regard i have for you i have taken the resolution to tell you so much obliged my dear kitty but for the intention only for the information you must agree is not likely to be at all agreeable that is to say you don t believe what i have told you is it not so we have always some difficulty in believing such things my pretty dear were it only from self love then you don t believe me i confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance what do you think of this kitty drew a little note from her bosom				4442.7921252611395
as we have said he perfectly understood the old man s vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing				3283.641495953966
for you have here at least three men who will not betray you				25.44036751993778
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so				218.03351726571668
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege				40497.419307967044
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went				2594.328591958466
during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those which precursors of the storm began to play in at the windows				1512.335851339408
today is the 29th of august the 21st of september will therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that time arrives and it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to give you till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within sight of each other when he had concluded his speech beauchamp bowed coldly to albert turned his back upon him and went to the press room				199.27966813401468
captain gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma				245806.07782440286
hardly had the police officer observed comminges at the end of the rue cocatrix when he said one word to the coachman who at once put his vehicle into motion and drove up before broussel s door				291.19235156593794
i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m de villefort her devotion to the elder dantès				830.445227046063

well said gondy have you kept your word with me not exactly replied the mendicant				43962199.19802443
one may be a jailer or a keeper and at the same time a good father and husband				2205.7975713245787
you have done for me as you promised all that you could do				1789.7734421706884
meanwhile mousqueton continued on his way and crossing the pont neuf still driving the two sorry animals before him he reached the rue aux ours				2121.868398331876
a woman will sell you for ten pistoles witness delilah				68420.94674248529
my dear m d artagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands he paused				2763.250172686534
m de tréville had spoken of her to the queen				410.8908933748917
you must make some reformation in that quarter you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely i will show the gentlemen the door monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh				1210.9958799628344
what are the turks to such men as the comte de la fere and the abbé d herblay ah his friend is with him said raoul				264.3044629673735
why the good god sends him back again caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair				1549.920915810615
he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street				1195.2202970320266
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure				2933.8190621983667
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel				2127.711396653856
but fortunately this was not the case and the governor left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition				16231.759039622391
stop and let us talk talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos				16.15262471761739
i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most loyal hand in the world aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell				3115.3742738132196
is your name bonacieux said he				26.94165266714548
would god send the same dreams to you as to me if you did not love me				75.6842103806532
the accusation no the letter are you sure i saw it done that alters the case				3922.601590138209
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king				606.3407324917313
i staked grimaud the silent grimaud divided into ten portions well what next said d artagnan laughing in spite of himself				284.47333803178446
the musketeer met with a superb andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire legs clean and elegant rising six years				2548.480705542382
all the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency already familiar				206952.7569886565
tell them to take arms to come here and to run				1293686.7293424373
besides this time my visit has a motive milady trembled she thought felton had told all				261.463992346861
waiter said danglars pen ink and paper pen ink and paper muttered fernand				3618.45995401166
yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning				1272.7270975772649
if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished				16039.930244954854
but although her voice sweet full and sonorous vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut				31978.282231808003
oh as i told you before i think the old fellow is very close come you do not flatter him i scarcely know him i think i have seen him three times in my life all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself				489.0052745203265
could you not perceive by our appearance that we were people of quality and not coiners say yes monsieur you are right said the host				682.2338619761548
bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was d artagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you				281.95082962931605
the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom valentine s i am coming was the customary signal of farewell				10997.547267869684
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened				15238.731815502426
yesterday s affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him quite planchet was sent for and instructions were given him				21.971847447768948
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing				948.8930882081737
but i am grateful i swear to you but what does this note contain milady will tell you ah you do not love me cried kitty and i am very wretched to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women				2011.2785592953755
well edmond i swear to you by the head of that son for whom i entreat your pity edmond for ten years i saw every night every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten years i heard every night the cry which awoke me shuddering and cold				1956.2654891265418
i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so				635.796970692547
luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto				5524.621748629703
will there be any mass asked one of the attendants				18219.355407045954
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions				232866.38203765682
and whatever might be considering the violent character of milady the danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress she ran back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her				102.7961732345811
there do you see madame he recognizes you and bows the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner				889.3430089118735
she lives she is in safety in a convent she is at béthune				2157.4978075079703
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all he will play me some dog s trick or other and that immediately said tréville				817.0446314055077
i may be besieged in my turn and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master lord monsieur				729.467430150403
indeed my dear friend said beauchamp first who had either the most feeling or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair albert remained silent and wrapped in thought				1378.6458667211887
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them				189.0672218496542
caderousse counted and again counted the gold and the notes then handed them to his wife who counted and counted them again in her turn				1644.4541179792157
but who then is andrea cavalcanti asked danglars in amazement				1820.908021454875
pardon me madame for having by a trick unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger and i in exchange pardon you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me				35.75715957393516
the month passed and morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources				9972.249784541316
it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth still argued caderousse i would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no hand in it				63.38831854710461
it is true she said the arch hypocrite see i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces				5085.1681022579205
i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the darkness				1266.5658052251686
whither goes she added he strongly interested in the route milady followed				24228.81274951619
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back				640.4616199582885
but this is tyranny cried one of them in very good french though with a foreign accent that this madman will not allow these good people access to their own wine				1594.081522518112
the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand daughter of henry iv the wife and daughter of charles i				1973.8192280743056

he saw the deputation from the parisians enter it they were coming to assign the definitive place for the conference and to make their bow to the queen				229.87753947005157
all this is very extraordinary said château renaud still what i admire the most i confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your orders are executed				2697.8099645226876
her mouth was mute but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked				164510.36166676617
m coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon porthos he contented himself with saying monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign will he not madame coquenard this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach and felt it				48.22084089233299
as for porthos i believe him to be eternal like god although less patient				10177.81219494245
go and tell him the ring is his d artagnan and bring back the two hundred pistoles with you reflect athos ready money is needful for the present time and we must learn how to make sacrifices				462609.5319474022
on the honor of a gentleman but i can not be imprisoned for the reason alleged it is impossible what reason asked d artagnan				9.187100483454891
the same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus				124707.05262033039
hope faintly murmured fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance				845.828709299
it appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the vaulted roofs and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts of her jailers				20605.697753184642
my mother gave it to me and i fool as i was instead of keeping the ring as a holy relic gave it to this wretch then my friend take back this ring to which i see you attach much value i take back the ring after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature				158738.54122821495
you who never interest yourself in politics ah				376.33798381464396
i will tell you the real facts				8841.869105508009
here said he leaning heavily on the arm of monte cristo here is the spot where my father stopped when the pharaon entered the port it was here that the good old man whom you saved from death and dishonor threw himself into my arms				543.7764408155197
one passed at the moment which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the seat and gave loose to dreams of ambition				1809.7761501982245
you will go to marseilles said dantès for you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them				46.80904663899976
there you must rest young people are such braggarts it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds				126465.2221622137
grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door well don t be inactive inactive my dear fellow				4233.552268983155
the cardinal in deep thought and in silence began to take off the robes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of parliament and to attire himself in the military coat which he wore with a certain degree of easy grace owing to his former campaigns in italy				1580.9237671411831
what do you say to this project the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king				587.5810727309429
i swear it was time for you to come back la ramee and i was eager to see you again monseigneur is too good said la ramee flattered by the compliment				14485.066329522486
ah said porthos opening his eyes at that last word				808.4647056290141
pardieu resumed the latter twisting his mustache look at me as long as you like my little gentleman				1840.5037845333934
come come gentlemen remove the fellow and d artagnan pushed the half stupefied mercer among the guards saying to him you are a shabby old fellow my dear				48700.50280151867
at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us				513.85173796443
the very madness of the abbé faria gone mad in prison condemned him to perpetual captivity				2030.5562013694464
vitray said he you will go with all speed to london				5080.47101611219
more dead than alive he looked around him				14.710737244901509
give the lackeys money and they will start we will give them money replied athos				14.057204930781632
at the end of an hour she was completely out of sight at least it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was				1865.5283528367038
the king took advantage of this favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly giving a fête				21752.251190661624
noirtier resumed m d avrigny in the same pitiless tone m				803.3958383055044
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression				14956.820095260236
i am captain dantès a loyal frenchman thought accused of treason tell me where you are conducting me and i promise you on my honor i will submit to my fate the gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion who returned for answer a sign that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied you are a native of marseilles and a sailor and yet you do not know where you are going on my honor i have no idea have you no idea whatever none at all that is impossible i swear to you it is true				1459.213159360776
endeavor then to accustom yourself to our manner of living in these northern climes as you did to those of rome florence milan and madrid it may be useful to you one of these days whether you remain here or return to the east the young girl raised her tearful eyes towards monte cristo as she said with touching earnestness whether we return to the east you mean to say my lord do you not my child returned monte cristo you know full well that whenever we part it will be no fault or wish of mine the tree forsakes not the flower the flower falls from the tree my lord replied haydée i never will leave you for i am sure i could not exist without you my poor girl in ten years i shall be old and you will be still young my father had a long white beard but i loved him he was sixty years old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw then tell me haydée do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of life shall i see you every day then what do you fear my lord you might find it dull no my lord				901.6538517210226
d artagnan hits on a plan				2765.7046712739398
see what is going on monsieur d artagnan said he				28.759146625380325
i saw madame de saint méran only last year at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said château renaud she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old from her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body				1095.9598501259968
the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied franz				216.37008938224943
the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him				18.80977117552699
in five minutes it will be too late mme				268.395357810883
just god he muttered whence comes this thought				1284.0206417001943
selim still holding in his hand the lighted match walked towards the opening in the cavern and aided by the faint light which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token				151399.76410447404
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos				17.87145413018231
how did you obtain these details sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure				2151.262171080322
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantès				285.7390232001771
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named				19278.816111131724
we fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you what will you do in a foreign land an enemy s country i traveled in england when i was young i speak english like an englishman and aramis too knows something of the language				2769.515962650166
bonacieux you will ruin us all but i have sworn to kill that man said d artagnan				1.4380447940343013
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles				2577.799753720737
stay with grandpapa maximilian i promise you not to persuade them to stay 40274m morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefort s apartments and to hers				37628.41761483643
ah said louise breathing freely here we are out of paris yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied eugénie				995.2463965109165
d artagnan sprang back the wall had closed again				277.560395606333
ah what else is there said danglars for at present i can not say that i have seen anything extraordinary				5297.398865827061
planchet obtained from rochefort the rank of sergeant in the piedmont regiment				18740.314014180625
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless				2714.4597581319
have you the wick asked the one who carried the lantern				657007.4205772001
there remained in the banker s house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and eugénie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise d armilly				21985.542013177343
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise				408957.9611482606
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination				30979.37225614949
she is gone said he she must have returned to the louvre you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out no replied bonacieux with a self sufficient air she is too superficial a woman is the young guardsman at home i do not think he is as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters all the same it is well to be certain how so by knocking at his door				203.630206846888
if one s lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly				26348.152624452534
however jacopo insisted on following him and dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust				17032.002442427645
at this sight alone franz felt his legs tremble under him				18.54134634206468
our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant you will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate the sergeant made a sign of comprehension				14144.85196388295
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent				181760.64738345164
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on board				22241.921738741898
four of these men were our musketeers preparing to listen to a letter one of them had just received				3139.823428886319
ladies said the officer do not disturb yourselves allow me time just to kill this gentleman and i will return and finish the last couplet we went out				270.069556514567
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly				2018.480479230611
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then at d artagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look				1345.0653572495664
in the position of porthos d artagnan would have been perfectly happy and to make porthos contented there was wanting what				723.6640178391659
on leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy became president on the place of his uncle embraced the cardinal s party which did not prove want of sagacity became chancellor served his eminence with zeal in his hatred against the queen mother and his vengeance against anne of austria stimulated the judges in the affair of calais encouraged the attempts of m de laffemas chief gamekeeper of france then at length invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal a confidence which he had so well earned he received the singular commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the queen s apartments				3136.8723687817183
against whom do they cry out				291.5132748611858
desideras diabolum unhappy man cried the jesuit				19742.965323972614
i only ask a brokerage of course that is perfectly just cried m de boville				1311764.2501068255
look here resumed d artagnan here is monsieur de bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges the devil said porthos and his guardian what would he have said to that do you hear interrupted d artagnan become a frondist my friend belong to the fronde and remember that i fill the count s place in everything and he jingled his money				812.6877356020169
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count				234.83324256024122
five millions a pretty sum eh peppino hush here is our man the clerk seized his pen and peppino his beads one was writing and the other praying when the door opened				1494.9646578427617
disguised as a monk he discovered the whole history in confession from the executioner of bethune and having confessed him after having learned everything from him he gave him absolution by planting this dagger into his heart				327.2627542784047
take care of your horses cried d artagnan to him				22.63974766069719
that makes no difference said aramis coloring and who affirmed as i said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it came it is only to poets that such things happen said athos gravely				8916.989025699706
the night is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude				30781.146935709738
eleven o clock sounded from all the clocks of the faubourg st germain				4407.806069473095
i confess it but pardon to every sin				187584.54690281797
here is my pass countersigned said the latter				4469.339519878967
the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation				21063.99277716031
upon which the stranger asked his name and learning that it was porthos and not d artagnan he assisted him to rise brought him back to the hôtel mounted his horse and disappeared so it was with monsieur d artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel it appears so and do you know what has become of him no i never saw him until that moment and have not seen him since very well i know all that i wish to know				1103.705287785173
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work				1919.1845597638496
suppose for instance the prisoner as is more than probable to have served under napoleon well can you expect for an instant that one accustomed at the word of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy than to slaughter his fellow creatures merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey				3263.5113820048914
three times i presented myself to ask his support and three times he ordered his servants to turn me away oh mon dieu				61493.96370200325
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count				279.07969414150386
in france he cried the usurper in france				456.8298354797238
i yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards andrea and slipping a packet of bank notes into the young man s hand				303.7089065224516
the procureur exerted himself to reply				744.737542352836
a ball had passed through his breast				1452.9192809322367
the cardinal rose and advanced in haste to receive the queen of england				1121.9460440901642
i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms				17301.38890608512
the study does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious and what is the pay a thousand francs sir it is nothing no but then we are lodged as you perceive monte cristo looked at the room				342.8619737046375
oh sire replied the minister we have no occasion to invent any every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which they seek to render but can not they trust to fortune and rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions well sir go said louis xviii and remember that i am waiting for you i will but go and return sire i shall be back in ten minutes and i sire said m de blacas will go and find my messenger wait sir wait said louis xviii				2367.6209763892366
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord				13957.199718154721
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded				13563.38401998235
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements				7098.6408498959545
two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved				27527.70068592578
those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier				6552.559447779189
i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night				779.6145635719424
at auteuil near paris m de villefort a second time raised his head looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa and became livid				11157.084327186412
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables				189383.85618439058
bonacieux tried to walk made two steps and sank upon her knees				743.3088521602741
mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance				5486.618285402616
i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow				4170.819764881885
nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos than i have but i like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves				256885.7124064959
who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death				382.03775825703065
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect your very humble and obedient servant godeau purveyor of the musketeers that s all well cried d artagnan				1.6243145389388818
the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence				56542.8900727544
come come said danglars tapping his fingers against the door i think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no orders respecting the nourishment of danglars the giant without answering went on with his dinner				1718.6331154187155
at this moment a patrol passed by				11166.835031394818
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes				630.7285452039667
are you waiting for him underneath these windows				1476.0316749225528
the day was as gay as the preceding one perhaps even more animated and noisy the count appeared for an instant at his window but when they again passed he had disappeared				542.9349095958949
gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter i can my lord said raoul				271.5459097520095
the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know the notary looked at the count with astonishment				696.4391705354487
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me i had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant				1125.459434086595
one of the three will certainly be at home perhaps all three				2792.6234248741926
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric in ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous				391343.24439438357
he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste something like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to him				164.23108490810907
now then what do you say to that alas				4770.776862200606
you have not by chance married a protestant for a third husband have you explain yourself my lord replied the prisoner with majesty for though i hear your words i declare i do not understand them then you have no religion at all i like that best replied lord de winter laughing				1288.3597582898958
oh my king and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation				330653.74484241393
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child				1130.1677211022002
monte cristo opened the carriage door morrel sprang out on the pavement bertuccio was waiting on the steps				3650.9287072451584
would not m noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte cristo				30.80029685960091
all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on				618.7713420632397
then he drew from his breast a little cross set in diamonds which like the order had been the gift of henrietta maria				174508.85401300987
the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nîmes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the child he might become acquainted with your person nay he might even then have known it				83.4814492959377
i was conducting some friends musketeers one of whom by the by had a dispute with a stranger a man who sought a quarrel with him for i don t know what exactly so said the host i remember it perfectly				6583.897935218222
sign my lord sign the liberation of milady de winter said felton holding out a paper to the duke				463.489814033574
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain				1444.355212958544
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make				6049.409773455035
you follow the world my young friend and i tremble lest grace prove not efficacious be satisfied my reverend father i can answer for myself mundane presumption i know myself father my resolution is irrevocable then you persist in continuing that thesis i feel myself called upon to treat that and no other				520.8334003204055
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my heart with one of his life giving rays				3730164.066032192
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and i can not fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you and as a proof of what i say here is mine in my pocket so saying he pulled out his own handkerchief likewise a very elegant handkerchief and of fine cambric though cambric was dear at the period but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms only ornamented with a single cipher that of its proprietor				129315.19653904364
i was generally liked on board and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me				81.71833136660335
bonacieux pushed a little servants door open by day but generally closed at night				551.4975129656227
well you stand well with m morrel i hear you insinuating dog you m				539.8206082610563
and dauphiné sir inquired the king of villefort				391.6028632701196
this rabbit dead the abbé adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill on this dunghill is a hen who pecking these intestines is in her turn taken ill and dies next day				376.4756486214015

my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know anything of my plan to convey him some morning on board by this means his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct				43352.68957070028
in that case felton would escape her for in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary				7734.575839550312
she has near her a certain laporte who i believe is the mainspring of all this i confess said the cardinal				380.90634078769256
he might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a frenchman				173996.35454305244
all this set off by the presence of that excellent prince who was so good natured who invented so droll tricks against monsieur de chavigny and so fine jokes against mazarin made for la ramee the approaching pentecost one of the four great feasts of the year				2807.93099341719
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello				17707.085716815647
when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place				952.1460103364018
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them i countenance nothing that is marvellous m albert				236.10605322399965

according to the count s directions danglars was waited on by vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy then having conducted him to the road and pointed to the post chaise left him leaning against a tree				6260.097185222306
this letter was read publicly in all parts of the city				2763.4596822658386
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn				124768.67353456082
although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair i will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you milady made no reply but became as pale as a corpse				1755.3117648564335
they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day				759.2176202247729
you will say then to my good and faithful parisians continued anne with a smile the expression of which did not deceive d artagnan that you have seen the king in bed asleep and the queen also ready to retire i shall tell them madame and those who accompany me will say the same thing but but what asked anne of austria				2007.1579020510933
i was at school at the time and the adventure appeared to me to be cruel for the king which would not prevent me said d artagnan if i knew where the duke of buckingham was from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the queen were it only to enrage the cardinal and if we could find means to play him a sharp turn i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in doing it and did the mercer rejoined athos tell you d artagnan that the queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter haberdasher she is afraid so wait a minute then said aramis				427.32331023737333
i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your father s favor and that i might do him justice				1681.009479581482
now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not certainly said morrel i am at your service count still what it is desirable i should know the real cause that is to say you would rather not no the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side enough said morrel who is your second witness i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel				2815.12621139543
as bertuccio with a respectful bow was moving away the count called him back				874.9143998738253
m noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the king s attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed				476482.5237284888
instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment instead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors instead of the court filled with bales of goods re echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom				6179.94679632791
you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time really said albert i do not know when i invited him three months ago he was then at rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone and you think him capable of being exact demanded debray				235.07613469184457
you were only a charming man before but if you accede to my proposal you will be adorable what must i do to attain such sublimity you are today free as air come and dine with me we shall be a small party only yourself my mother and i				1889.9070240286524
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense				23517.05510171848
though danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation				9577.130839734078
it was evening i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which i in my pride pronounced				27348.09229416763
his two companions were already on horseback				5379.712458668083
let him pass d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard				1270.9895632688608
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human				148704.3896914048
i think he is about to leave paris he was going to his banker his banker				3170.0131419023146
she listened at eugénie s door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place				901.9823872948314
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with d artagnan on one side porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan				546.6478847636042
great god she is losing her senses while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong voice aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water but he stopped at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the countenance of athos who standing before the table his hair rising from his head his eyes fixed in stupor was looking at one of the glasses and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt				1682.7168839119345
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which to day we are trying to perform for charles i but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years well in spite of that d artagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her no indeed said d artagnan i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance you see then d artagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is athos said d artagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven so then said athos offering his hand to d artagnan				3.209183230586358
behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers				1265.1358658071144
speak to me not as a magistrate but as a friend and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay villefort bowed				1974.7493432200563
the audience m de tréville was at the moment in rather ill humor nevertheless he saluted the young man politely who bowed to the very ground and he smiled on receiving d artagnan s response the béarnese accent of which recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country a double remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages but stepping toward the antechamber and making a sign to d artagnan with his hand as if to ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him he called three times with a louder voice at each time so that he ran through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry accent				4812.497606875258
thanks to the attentions of raoul and the man who accompanied the young gentleman the color gradually returned to the pale cheeks of the dying man who opened his eyes at first entirely bewildered but who soon fixed his gaze upon the person who had saved him				16.566586888293365
d artagnan approached him and seeing him stare so fixedly said well friend				551.6437461753494
and if ever i am reconciled with the court i shall prove to you i hope that i remain your friend as well as that of what the devil are their names d artagnan and porthos d artagnan and porthos ah yes				852.7211902957139
he again arose and went to the door				256.28507461803014
porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard				1875.7594816461055
be one or the other but not both replied porthos				17.132719675188167
then he placed at the bottom of the valise belonging to the young man a small bag of louis called olivain the lackey who had followed him from blois and made him pack the valise under his own eyes watchful to see that everything should be put in which might be useful to a young man entering on his first campaign				29146.172744359927
i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs an officer brave and handsome as a youthful caesar then pretending to see raoul for the first time ah				399.3094008056686
what do i see that he wouldn t swear swear what that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight and aramis wouldn t swear no attention then athos did not lose sight of the two speakers				142936.4399376244
and i say that murders are committed here said morrel whose voice though lower in tone lost none of its terrible distinctness i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months				2102.993001835923
that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlini s rear when he fell				4477.539162066184
once upon a time well go on signor pastrini turned toward franz who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him justice he had had a great many frenchmen in his house but had never been able to comprehend them				93.07532566008811
and the man opposite to you is the man i saw go in do you know him i thought i recognized him and was not mistaken				1384.2767006827287
the duke approached the altar knelt as a priest might have done before a crucifix and opened the casket				15639.672446422854
yes madame only it seems to me that your majesty goes too far in engaging to load us with a friendship so far above our merit				223639.78612001054
does he still live inquired the innkeeper				4118.483450953257
eh monsieur eh friend said d artagnan a half pistole for that paper my faith monsieur with great pleasure				1634.3160272498912
the corsican ogre at the sight of this agitation louis xviii				1517.7236725638206
does the house approve that the examination should take place today 40196m yes was the unanimous answer				1197.0117741235433
if i were but learned in theology i should recollect what it was he used to dispute about with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits when we were at crevecoeur i should know what doctrine he leans to and i should glean from that what saint he has adopted as his patron				10947.246460532984
the judge we remember that the abbé busoni remained alone with noirtier in the chamber of death and that the old man and the priest were the sole guardians of the young girl s body				930.4914707189477
by the light of one of these torches d artagnan perceived men in uniform				11456.685618023006
his eyes acquired that quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed				108582.38089831041
what possessions what reputation what pull as beauchamp says have i				1712.259356295666
in their stead d artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall				1203.2161917443432
the hour then for which i had been waiting during the last year had at length arrived				2102.0756535086193
the cavalier entered the second hall which was guarded by the musketeers and doorkeepers				103621.88956560905
at last after renewed hesitation dantès entered the second grotto				6275.734448780362
you will appear at this ball yes with those studs yes the queen s paleness if possible increased the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character				5527.119672168032
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to milady to be silent his face was much agitated				5509.1324797973
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security that is policy this policy of louis xiii				2141.7474215940865
gentlemen i know i am in the hands of an avenging god				412.1610948887539
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this				1728.128667396497
oh your great work on the monarchy of italy faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus				130814.32036775055
inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution				1766.4606797435395
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride				7488.055101950855
but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness				15694.955995225682
france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence				2088.723863922005
egad cried aramis you set me thinking				12955.274848609499
the poor girl originally possessed much more than that she was born to treasures in comparison with which those recorded in the thousand and one nights would seem but poverty she must be a princess then you are right and she is one of the greatest in her country too i thought so				169.96239417482963
he touched him on the shoulder				926.8023974264256
teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her emotion				2419.325424288839
the iron box was there no one had touched it under a beautiful fig tree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot				4723.6300930001835
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living imbecile exclaimed la carconte				12777.907040448243
oh what imprudence my lord said d artagnan tis not good to be about just here without a light				1977.13405726858
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat				2847.3676073375073
no but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted				150699.95892611178
they were attired as peasants of albano velletri civita castellana and sora				119874.71360817402
d artagnan when he gave way to his own feelings which were in accordance with those of the queen had accomplished more than the most astute diplomacy could have attempted				212531.13957268433
morrel raised his head and reading the eyes of the old man which gleamed with unnatural lustre stay he said m				333.5836331877531
let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us we will cross the tyne reach scotland and you will be saved is this your counsel also winter inquired the king				486.0913643957344
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis				463.5466168696212
my mind was already made up				640.7560892790523
a draught of wine d artagnan oh i ll answer for you said the gascon filling porthos s glass to the brim but when you have drunk give me your opinion upon what asked porthos				20.036067744655245
you smile yes why do you do so i smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own				843.1556867759035
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon				3216.404137693421
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him				12.23848219983008
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion				6338.916893190608
then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit				5670.648572449109
speak then chevalier said the cardinal				287.4028405413668
i felt pain i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed				3671.599240571518
where are you going marechal asked the queen				234.18534199072369
anne of austria took two steps forward				3172.299475048752
here i am smiled porthos with his sublime composure				9303.584021151375
see what an exordium cried the jesuit				20385.862634073488
to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments				57976.08258553714
15 ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father				555.9154671933977
besides by the faith of bonacieux you call yourself bonacieux interrupted d artagnan				1.8965694768752104
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances				4923.54621198177
a positive feast cried m coquenard turning about in his chair a real feast epulœ epulorum				126514.43924354654
0148m eh pardieu said the individual whose description we have twice given entering the door what a great deal of ceremony				124844.37328971128
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money				1054.3749152863384
i pardieu and you would arrest him why not you would arrest the duc de beaufort armed in the field if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in so would i said porthos				17.63603224068115
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god				625.9550745311356
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities				134493.71739474157
imprisonment menaces ill treatment she has suffered everything				497.67753859248023
well your publisher is very generous my dear aramis that s all i can say how monsieur cried bazin a poem sell so dear as that				736.5835326415541
while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed order and when again our attention is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed end				1309.7709273888233
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelle en serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place				922.7089921330567
be easy on that head replied athos you know i am cool enough porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe				134161.28589825056
i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and i overlooked that in italy because in italy those things are thought nothing of				2469.7200534974013
buckingham remained for a moment dazzled				243885.29165983765
i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so long it will happen one day or the other 20083m and do you propose to make this journey very shortly i do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability incognito the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice				2312.4729433959706
i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries but to do this he must have spoken he has done better than that he has made himself understood how was such a thing possible by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil good morning madame said the count bowing				2113.114324256891
the young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next day without getting any message				9180.482244755924
but what he saw made good what he lacked in perfect comprehension of the language				2979.900629548273
the hour came for him to retire				3822.704721548689
my dear planchet said d artagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me				27.929322007279914
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand				362.97080183907815
there remained athos and d artagnan				13.705596990596238
jump then monsieur pistache but pistache as at first turned round on his legs and stood with his back to the cane				12980.392400276853
yes he said there is the stone upon which i used to sit there is the impression made by my shoulders on the wall there is the mark of my blood made when one day i dashed my head against the wall				893.148691313906
i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it				56.272701468006105
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear moistened eyes raised to heaven				760.1322792558639
yes monsieur i know only him well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boy slayer not too much so replied d artagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you				187.14987227796374
it was one of the gascon s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty				27184.11797017246
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos				249.88668068518535
although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x in 1829 who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat pocket but at his button hole ah interrupted morcerf laughing beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the corsaire or the charivari but spare my future father in law before me then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron i do not know him returned monte cristo but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance for i have a credit opened with him by the house of richard blount of london arstein eskeles of vienna and thomson french at rome as he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at maximilian morrel				1036.8574131494042
on seeing the appointed signal groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the gentlemen				1323.9228867800084
and did the eccentric person commit any new originality can he be seen without doing so				207.17657190191747
arrived at the angle of a street he pointed to a small house isolated solitary and dismal				157022.99958120432
look at me madame look around me				38.598190407798526
to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beauty it was too much for a visionary it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours				143706.77861142333

would you like to see a camp of bandits in repose he inquired				6672.970987088799
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force				2424.504965642721

so thought the gascon here s a young blade who has already his love affair who doesn t at all agree with athos in his hatred to the fair sex				28652.902474567825
we must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible				1213.6058654699088

thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required				8585.261219647195
gentlemen return your swords to their scabbards well provided you replace your pistols in your belt willingly and d artagnan set the example				2569.6165264581264
and what may be that description dark complexion hair eyebrows and whiskers black blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his button hole a hat with wide brim and a cane ah ha that s it is it said noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the rue coq héron didn t i say that your police were good for nothing yes but they may catch him yet true said noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance at these words he rose and put off his frock coat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his son s toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers				149639.04294490506

let us follow him said de guiche it will be the surest plan i was about to propose so doing answered de bragelonne				19181.379881359295

we will explain in a few words how d artagnan had been led to choose that place of residence				4728.109991901575
the baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward				34542.68801341085
i think he must have made an agreement with death to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed				44145.60278136086
at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franz s imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina				34193.88718517854

ah madame de chevreuse was less cruel than you				278.3483392593423
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required i know it said athos coolly since here it is and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels				12377.475099018511
she had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor				11028.109964999521
go on it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the garden hedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence				2080.6471729381037
athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine				1767.812268358098
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom house officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past				2156.581363567901

the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face				592.0198433552512

the king quite delighted inquired if the cardinal was still at the louvre he was told that his eminence awaited the orders of his majesty in the business cabinet				6010.707613861629
d artagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous				23621.19211423128
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms				24482.849950927495

the plan adopted by d artagnan was soon perfected				292172.6500894116
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob not a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarin s witticisms or by the jests of the multitude seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place				872.4289711778633

you prohibited my mentioning my father s name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips monte cristo turned to haydée and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in greek πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖν that is tell us the fate of your father but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow				586.3070742922714

as to his voice prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at others rough and almost hoarse				161668.05000182893

the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum				124661.62966787843
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh				1121.4186723093817
on the other side of the house to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to sight and smell was a billiard table which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on the cloth				13349.550785301815

m de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face				758.7930857819372

he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile				609.6649279173156

d artagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance				3536.820060794014
yes i dare say verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the attendant of madame de chevreuse				3348.4949345947675
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation				2903.8952041670755
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said d artagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m bonacieux				2266.1199074093374

thank him then madame if you have any affection for me milady frowned slightly a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at it				73.14063887504442
well said athos when aramis and he were in the boat again are you beginning to be convinced that we should have done a bad turn to all these people in arresting mazarin you are wisdom incarnate athos aramis replied				5007.418561677772
his praises increased raoul s friendship twofold				15104.563408602184
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity				23091.222185765113
even his breathing seemed to be arrested				6505.375172214011
i command you not to stir attempt nothing not to let your countenance betray a thought and i will send you tidings				66872.57385335737
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him				165.53526689492486
m de tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might				4915.096947467756
the state which is now threatened would be safe and you and i well you the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility did he tell you so yes i know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise be satisfied replied bonacieux my wife adores me and there is yet time the ninny murmured mme				62.1322284857123
the young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired				2404.500813470918
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high				19334.273486610502
this time said d artagnan when they were sufficiently distant to proceed at a trot i think all is lost and we have nothing better to do than to reach france				312.32886952529276
during this time edmond seated on his bed with his head in his hands tried to collect his scattered thoughts				1057.1553467708022
let us regret their absence to ourselves for our own sakes but not speak of it you are right but what are you going to do until this evening				542.1520687177186
what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy				1482.0970128341103
bravo cried d artagnan you sing charmingly dear aramis				75.83517686037219
beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the world				956.5779803456651
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens				19346.077792664728
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme				451.99486807809507
five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage				1001.9374523916397
then there are those for which chance sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all				756.0258734018397
at noon they rode into the avenue of pierrefonds				37488.08152987998
he had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve hours				2072.4989329786554

having reached the summit of a rock he saw a thousand feet beneath him his companions whom jacopo had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which edmond s skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish				167280.55858855296
excellency said he gravely addressing franz if you look upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say anything it was for your interest i albert does not say you are a liar signor pastrini said franz but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us but i will believe all you say so proceed but if your excellency doubt my veracity signor pastrini returned franz you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no one believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of half your audience				2133.110685127704
she seems to have been taken suddenly ill very probably answered the count				224.93587315762957
but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for that with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home				2073.530917087122
i shall find him there without doubt you will monsieur he persists in remaining there				606.3358173731925
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men				613.2543950972469

come come said porthos jump in but monsieur said mousqueton i can t swim let me stay here and me too monsieur said blaisois				17262.278937524068
hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of giving myself at present i shall appear to sell myself that is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympathies monseigneur well well said the cardinal i don t wish you any ill but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends				335.5601227036256
i hope we shall have something better to do to night than to draw the sword what have we to do egad				33144.85463245977
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied				8846.811792893895
he was attired as he had been on the previous evening and waved his pocket handkerchief to his guest in token of adieu				67840.07983414814
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m bazin				7330.852057631936
do not be alarmed maximilian it is nothing and has already passed away				607.5826413709993
i will give you the baton of the marechal de la meilleraie who does not seem to be much in favor just now and so sir said the queen you are seriously afraid of a public tumult seriously said gondy astonished at not having further advanced i fear that when the torrent has broken its embankment it will cause fearful destruction and i said the queen think that in such a case other embankments should be raised to oppose it				248.52168601759442
let us bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts i am willing if anyone should suspect this that my silence on the subject should be imputed to my ignorance				28729.680615620415
as long as the procurator s wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself				829.8795541667124
twenty four years ago i returned proud and joyful to my country				3395.7875449942294
but monsieur de tréville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers monseigneur is correctly informed said d artagnan				24.018959514043264
i wished to live said athos				15.97931876680475
and you shall be alone replied the young man				109.60873355251998
she had married a younger brother of the family who had left her a widow with one child				1394.922183437219
there were then great griefs tears without end and solemn promises to remain faithful all of course on the part of the hostess				4539.686741019661
not crush that accursed race murmured he abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment				117188.86788103492
the servant went out but returned almost immediately				3050.177122285847
it is enough replied the prince				811.5291033336379
buckingham at once remembered the circumstance and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards he put his horse into a gallop and rode straight up to d artagnan				5.002915667264648
d artagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross but nothing absolutely nothing				628.1865888315331
it must be it shall be seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death				640.2774927038943
the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside				5444.066453480122
matrimonial projects the day following this scene at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office his coupé did not appear				6710.713076234068
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted				7177.674859886564
you know about it was i not your second cried d artagnan				1.5462371044749663
this way this way my dear albert said he holding out his hand to the young man				108.90375348544346
now will you make me a report of all that has happened why i have related the events to you				47.584126896362065
i will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another manner but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal to increase the hilarity of the queen mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls				7137.694495887134
during the night the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet which whatever may be said about the equality of death is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life				428.6483977513603
the three presents of d artagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april 1625 the market town of meung in which the author of romance of the rose was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it				276.87830335852664
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general and who charges me with this monseigneur said d artagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me what do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus of milady de winter replied d artagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished she has been punished monseigneur and who has punished her we she is in prison she is dead dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead				782.818544094639
this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible upon my word said dantès you make me shudder				5019.524602515835
all that is in this grotto my friend my house in the champs élysées and my château at tréport are the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantès upon the son of his old master morrel				946.1781026004035
with his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter				225676.22383722398
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening				3272.150166060782
never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams and you are right my dear la ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was after this i will think of nothing but eating and drinking hush said la ramee and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts				118763.20697840747
that s exactly what my wife said monseigneur do you know who carried off your wife no monseigneur you have suspicions nevertheless yes monseigneur but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary and i no longer have them your wife has escaped				23007.84550487082
at the same moment the count seized with his left hand the assassin s wrist and wrung it with such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers and caderousse uttered a cry of pain				4938.632311619084
athos talked of the discretion of grimaud who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth				4256.940871624215
he was armed at all points				173180.5411956457
that devil porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck at villars cotterets he wrote to the cardinal my lord i have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty men				473.5621159374117
come in gentlemen come in called d artagnan you are here in my apartment and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal then gentlemen you will not oppose our executing the orders we have received asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party				3032.0189171272987
each retired to his own apartment				649.120804783226
i wish you to do so said he				27.221557080772463
yes i know what you mean he said you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world that the deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months and from which valentine has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural means i was not thinking of that replied madame danglars quickly				1241.0475609417072
he felt a carpet under his feet a door opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant light dazzled his eyes				618.4002764825232
that happened as i told you in 1829				51081.36738899841
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box				1390.7453164819476
this way light us downstairs bernouin the valet held a wax light the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the palais royal				3253.694336176886
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping				3963.2081396829453
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the auberge of the golden lily				152565.2354598587
my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us				167.55316390053883
do not dig any more said the voice only tell me how high up is your excavation on a level with the floor how is it concealed behind my bed has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner no what does your chamber open on a corridor and the corridor on a court alas murmured the voice				501.40989278920915
scarcely had they reached by the rue de la mule the iron gate of the place royale when they perceived three cavaliers d artagnan porthos and planchet the two former wrapped up in their military cloaks under which their swords were hidden and planchet his musket by his side				971.8851624226205
at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open				2699.690073173882
he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed				3339.4380240838664
he had tried his strength to the utmost				41994.79097517885

dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions				8256.10519320289

so much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his suspicions				11506.9236891865
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention				821.2517780109881
once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made up when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug				19487.73531323409

those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents				206477.65225248694
he delayed presenting himself at morrel s but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him				19.015180551817817

that little man in black that you upset at the corner of saint jean cemetery that s the man my dear fellow he was an annoyance to the cardinal				463.1146923528637

0023m alas sir in the most unexpected manner				885.890996302093
it was now his turn to look about him the hôtel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his right anyone could descend from the openings in the tower and examine every corner of the roof below and andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of these openings				163485.0041279455
at this precise time the first gendarme andrea had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of police and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door				312.74048520890216
the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court				1298.1041902481795

that s a snare said athos don t go d artagnan and yet replied d artagnan i think i recognize the writing it may be counterfeit said athos				245.40025879313993
all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious				155277.27111693914
our bark flew before the wind				2065.1229854286426
a table ready set out awaited them				62.57703235085227
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets				129002.82329238523
ah said i after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once is that the example you set penelon cries the captain very well wait a minute he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols				2430.1718144738834
and when did you arrive here inquired she				273.0259071144572
but you my dear athos you who so generously distributed the englishman s pistoles which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do i am satisfied with having killed that fellow my boy seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an englishman but if i had pocketed his pistoles they would have weighed me down like a remorse go to my dear athos you have truly inconceivable ideas let it pass				3358.402634921776
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins poison death exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir 50071m hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death				325.3714401471151
i would not go at all said aramis				18.832418569316175
i am a frondist from my heart				206.3790028899707
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st sebastian well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story				6300.747627402088
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance				2996.6919689157407
aramis blushing in spite of himself took the letter which was in a large coarse hand and not particular for its orthography				124676.13467620194
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds				3159.0580440074696
bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable				30537.645169340187
there go two miscreants said he it is a pity they are not really related then after an instant of gloomy reflection come i will go to see the morrels said he i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred 30147m chapter 57				154222.2196524385
but then young man and i pray of you to give me your full attention then i thought i could not be doing anything displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at liberty one who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation and have your notions changed asked dantès with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me no neither do i wish to incur guilt				30155.45897624719
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood				4165.326337488062
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle				5571.043179245683
yes count said milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met				25467.89775515868
i ought to meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own alas said monte cristo your words sear and embitter my heart the more so as you have every reason to hate me				63.405186846491645
the cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for albert				521.9668719450153
you are right a mute from the east				9810.64347834704
oh what larks meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning				183332.1463951885
there you stood stammering stupefied annihilated				191288.33392175226
yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion and what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment				777.6430723236115
excuse my putting such a question to you it is not indiscreet returned morcerf with the simplicity of conviction				9432.806344225562
the abbé began like you and in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons here dantès whirled the stool round his head				311.73163620475765
it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette				4330.741910579467
i hear no balls whistle and i see nobody they are firing at the corpses replied athos				14.916641294727127
unhappy man cried he wringing his hands in his turn you love valentine that daughter of an accursed race never had morrel witnessed such an expression never had so terrible an eye flashed before his face never had the genius of terror he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous nights of algeria shaken around him more dreadful fire				3715.463496027288
he rubbed his eyes doubting if he really saw before him athos and aramis and forced at last to yield to evidence he was on the point of breaking forth in exclamations when he encountered a glance from the eyes of porthos the repressive force of which he was not inclined to dispute				1508097.3291901855
i hope so the friends embraced cordially d artagnan pressed raoul s hand				251.4863145353622
this account confirmed that of the mayor				40246.504516035275
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels				216066.89010197847
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers i regard them as invaluable now said monte cristo as to the mother of the young man as to the mother of the young man repeated the italian with anxiety				1270.4787615318007
yes yes continued m de tréville growing warmer as he spoke and his majesty was right for upon my honor it is true that the musketeers make but a miserable figure at court				960.212484735266
i thought that we were finally quit of monsieur de beaufort yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water				1266.4160355623633
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain				3472.638319332079
if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping the scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbé s plan has not even the merit of originality then turning to faria i inquired if you are well fed said he				25.287982303916674
by me what was his name lord winter your uncle exclaimed cromwell				6602.364898329529
then caderousse sat astride the coping and drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise				226194.21015748623
she was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of sleep				1014.6542568158236
peeping out from the drapery he could see the rows of halberdiers and musketeers around the scaffold and the first ranks of the populace swaying and groaning like the sea				2286.829079118785
ah sir replied caderousse we can not console those who will not be consoled and he was one of these besides i know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me				46.07589096744837
i shall hear from you yes thanks thanks dear love adieu the sound of a kiss was heard and valentine fled through the avenue				28203.838470754326
god bless his majesty yes repeated the leader in a whisper god bless his majesty and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn				1881.6056351354503
no hermine replied debray you can not make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count s				673.0418027191009
come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed how so asked beauchamp				137.56441674030467
the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la réserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar				200386.07039696127
am i to be captured he cried no not if i can use more activity than my enemies				1392.4101782333441
at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star				49719.13202421408
no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue d enfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession i rang the bell and fled with all speed				3048.5253283733073
his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée when suddenly the door opened				1411.3906586271803
as he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath				3546.3209762200354
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me was that my soul if i may say so waked in my sleeping body was that i saw that i heard				918.7738492384613
you believe so i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you your excellency i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers i neglected to bring them that is unfortunate returned monte cristo				6.865764589963693

i devoted three years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and fifty volumes till i knew them nearly by heart so that since i have been in prison a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me				45.40855534451767
madame de vernet was driven from me putange was exiled madame de chevreuse fell into disgrace and when you wished to come back as ambassador to france the king himself remember my lord the king himself opposed it yes and france is about to pay for her king s refusal with a war				3672.2330685652223
you can understand that one of two things must have happened he must either have fallen flat in which case the blow from a height of ninety feet must have killed him instantly or he must have fallen upright and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom where he remained poor fellow then you pity him said the count				231.49772923189403
he called porthos to look at it				34.52574818743566

d artagnan already wore his uniform for being nearly of the same size as aramis and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit				14236.213922368763
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the child of god is as invisible as the parent				135322.91945059548
caderousse was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like m morrel to aid dantès he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the hope of drowning reflection				6200.112356413097
he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged				5973.33531719508

the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way				439.8276149348186
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls				180590.39597397184
nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer				15514.145856056044
he threw them on the table without looking at them so sure was he of victory d artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill humor				1771.6510488367662

i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the purpose i intended everyone looked at monte cristo with astonishment he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth or that he was mad				2850.9814623401985
we have before stated that all the servants had fled				33485.924409793355

then mine is the boat you want sir				393.67393675952525
not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor that is my opinion said aramis				16.15813270924995
franz continued it was as we said the fifth of february				33487.26569263024
in the rue saint honore athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he was				1816.987637521523
in other parts of the forest the light could scarcely penetrate through the foliage and the stems of two old oak trees the refuge of the squirrel startled by the travelers were in deep shadow				2692.5908838349687
come caderousse no nonsense said he				26.214947551579492
noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately				201954.82881823924
live the guards m de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost				1236.4868468029642
oh more than i can say kitty				4953.939437524313
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life				540.0337829437458
this was the more so because bonacieux s reflections were all rose colored				13598.794593110855
and i thank you have what you will and he made a sign to franz to take what he pleased				2015.1328428288837
finally athos undertook to provide in any event the means of leaving england in case either of failure or of success				16540.587735500492
d artagnan who had no settled habits of his own as he came from his province into the midst of a world quite new to him fell easily into the habits of his friends				423.8664585623066
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned				1074.9681070678807
on whom does my bleeding heart repose				6372.5266602697
the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds but at length d artagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick				163148.89320148612
and yet instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd				3038.9666056562573
withdraw him gently from the queen whom he does not like from mazarin whom he despises				170393.87023344176
well thought d artagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my fault for it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage without reckoning monsieur added planchet to his master s audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to him				154.73724680224328
but to you d artagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend				646.3580006692462
the fact was in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day				767.3850389003703
it was now one o clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home				2858.3769508193527
oh if she betrayed your majesty on the side of your honor it would be quite another thing and i should be the first to say no grace sire no grace for the guilty happily there is nothing of the kind and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are but the queen not the less deserves all my anger it is you sire who have now incurred hers				1445399.142772949
two bars removed formed an opening for a man to pass through				10423.495328444542
the young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed and a smile of pride passed over his lips				668.8800482367626
but tell me now count exclaimed albert delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so distinguished a person as monte cristo tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely one of the chimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the course of our lives but which like a house built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind i pledge you my honor returned the count that i mean to do as i have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit paris when do you propose going thither have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself certainly i have in a fortnight or three weeks time that is to say as fast as i can get there nay said the count i will give you three months ere i join you you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties				15864.886595654556
there was nothing but felicitations pressures of the hand and embraces there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the rochellais				24622.052002150718
now i entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly				234983.92276362533
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect				2982.9884825016297
though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country brutal politics i must confess said maximilian but don t attach any serious importance dear to what your father said				424.58133611931106
the picture seems to have a malign influence for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping				10935.841367897436
i will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter i will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak i beg of you valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine				447.125782097267
but cried felton that is a fleur de lis which i see there and therein consisted the infamy replied milady				107.48594102268751
bertuccio was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same time he feared to have frowns				144292.62253244562
the comte de wardes was announced and d artagnan was introduced				13342.614125703936
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son				929.9108579238026
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty				2329.880980650695
you have promised me to go said the queen				220.58648174179623
sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter				2206.2730389845624
you are of so superior a mind nothing escapes you why do you say so because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that m de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house mercédès raised herself on her feverish arm				882.8677964012952
you think so do you and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible				2665.2291315567595
ah monseigneur continued bonacieux throwing himself at his eminence s feet ah how truly you are the cardinal the great cardinal the man of genius whom all the world reveres the cardinal however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so vulgar a being as bonacieux did not the less enjoy it for an instant then almost immediately as if a fresh thought has occurred a smile played upon his lips and he said offering his hand to the mercer rise my friend you are a worthy man the cardinal has touched me with his hand				197.9380950298148
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body				987.2979295519036
d artagnan bent down to his horse s neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat				1062.6637353316355
these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third athos was not altogether the queen s dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again				147.8948348385085
it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted valentine				311.9725345054785
well while taking my walk i will call on him and we will talk				7603.537984749497
after having stood a few minutes in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp dantès eye habituated as it was to darkness could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like diamonds				3151.505178918862

five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs				19122.002118025277
then the cardinal whatever he said very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter in which frenchman would combat against frenchman was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress				408362.45573139156

ah the young rascal stealing in a garden he does not know where that may lead him to certainly it is wrong said monte cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant				235356.8936373274

planchet whom he had sent home two hours before from the hôtel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him				17.902376540860214

madame de longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head				423.17619120542906
he bowed to him then full of gratitude for the past and for the future and the worthy captain who on his side felt a lively interest in this young man so brave and so resolute pressed his hand kindly wishing him a pleasant journey				2626.035195051605

grimaud moved as if to leave the room				316.03144939135325
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility				29583.764783897237
in this case replied caderousse let s have some more wine				1699.647499129431
he shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when madame danglars recovered from her half fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream				1004.0820246277341

but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard eyes glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible event and with his clenched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections				14176.547471277598
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me				82.83736080653941
when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m d épinay into personal contact				176612.8952110384

but what are they to do				1221.6070854369893

remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below				5855.521732009423
the two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the louvre				5516.198273074661
i wish to tell him to make my child happy i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey me in fact i will know him i will continued the old lady with a fearful expression that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty madame said villefort you must lay aside these exalted ideas which almost assume the appearance of madness				2778.4417788376654

toward the end of the service the queen seeing comminges standing near her waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the louvre said in a whisper go comminges and may god aid you comminges immediately left the church and entered the rue saint christophe				122540.86863991246
it is god s pleasure that things should be so the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the fact that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by some particular and distinctive appellation her husband had bestowed on her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce				253741.3743472164

although said villefort it will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her grandfather s fortune i do not think that m d épinay will be frightened at this pecuniary loss				6190.91282168338
why does not god if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and fire and consume them altogether you speak as though you had loved this young dantès observed the abbé without taking any notice of his companion s vehemence				255876.88912417332

but suppose one pass as is permissible in philology from the word itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the case of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the word of him who inflicts them				227.72141032011132

however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings 30093m i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32 000 francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5 000 francs each he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars				637.0007907337254
m danglars was out but the count was asked to go and see the baroness and he accepted the invitation				9077.23936453895
and you said athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter s name				762.4479272510446

come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m noirtier de villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being not of providence but of fate				2542.0748898812317

nothing nothing replied the priest go on it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and fernand who put it in the post but exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there yourself i said caderousse astonished who told you i was there the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness true true said caderousse in a choking voice i was there and did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abbé if not you were an accomplice sir replied caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception				290688.5078543005
he had entered villefort s office expecting that the magistrate would tremble at the sight of him on the contrary he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his head leaning on his hand				385.9555980928484
m noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me				26.14684723517111
the greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised				169334.4258755362
milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to her				80.77937923462953
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance				1992.498392182418
the snow deadened the noise of his fall				6735.911618442822

i used to play almost every night in france and since your return to england i have not handled a card or dice box i sincerely pity you said d artagnan with an air of profound compassion				27453.846751647867
the two friends were perfectly stupefied				26600.731655679938
yes yes said caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy and why because mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens really answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness				2929.4505866986365
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground				841.7677546723853
i can not reconcile myself to this idea it would madden me				58.2752202149005

he was accompanied by two of the yacht s crew				11711.361793509715

he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthos that is to say exactly upon the baldric				3357203.714168839
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist				1552216.805138388
this event might have three causes the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majesty s guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a well furnished purse in his pocket				786.1500176862442
the queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care				2912.981848207794
he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and cast off cloaks for mousqueton and thanks to a very intelligent tailor who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them and whose wife was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic habits mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master				1501.328989077599
the devil but sir said planchet with a look of shrewdness i know where bazin is where is he at notre dame what has he to do at notre dame he is beadle bazin beadle at notre dame				2277.3933500199664

in the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of everything				669.3969417704702
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role				190428.66978652254
if i stay in paris i can not go to rome if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur d artagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneur s resignation i am to remain minister then said mazarin				355.450297514203
albert s lips scarcely whispered good bye but his look was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation				15716.779349485965
now understand me said the count no direct questions my dear morcerf if you wish to know anything tell me and i will ask her agreed ali reappeared for the third time and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the door to signify to his master and albert that they were at liberty to pass on				636.1836320357697
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil				7947.045746422178
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so				211.21572426396753
and with my grandfather s consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but morrel s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them				51.454977742528094
he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the door of his study opened				1444.0921450245796
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan				8676.70014979565
0057m danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès arrested				6258.461593197612
now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much				1533.9652728674926
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us				145.7522585813641
hardly however had he taken ten steps before he returned				1048.2214992954616
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it				20.39239892167087
how ghastly pale he is oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz				219.5381940647651
i swear to you i like no better than yourself to meet that viper in my path ah				257.4754307909478
no madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends and porthos turning on his heel made a step to retire				2845.453850501289
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison				1095.336050030889
he had no fears as to how he should live good seamen are welcome everywhere				10338.385194780243
i looked into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs his back was turned towards me so that i could not see the expression of his countenance neither should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hands				476.8454618790192
are you going added she to comminges				1648.0729648104311

i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances				23716.85440674148
oh how happy you make us				225.92912157547073
in spite of his habitual silence the poor lad this time found his speech				40904.1614351219

the captain glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the captain had any died away				589.364320261157
well what is the matter asked the young lieutenant				2061.7953213659716

he had but one fault he was a gourmand he had found the pates good the wine excellent				5064.1064056075265
no it will all go well m d épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m d épinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation				461883.04028374405
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived but have you only two days of leave raoul on the contrary sir i have ten nor is it to the camp i wish to go where then said athos smiling if it be not a secret				1527.6978675947164

i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you d artagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in milady s soul whose depths were dark and unknown				8291.454540717948
yes i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly				15858.578667168566
who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of edmond dantès every eye was turned towards the young man who spite of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm voice i am he what is your pleasure with me edmond dantès replied the magistrate i arrest you in the name of the law me repeated edmond slightly changing color and wherefore i pray i can not inform you but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination m morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless				2619.772952515525
i know not why but i feel that this crime you acknowledge then the existence of the crime yes i see too plainly that it does exist				5494.587852132625

it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you oh your excellency exclaimed baptistin eagerly				1945.0897006314015
those who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in regarding his outburst as sublime				161534.74044778384
you arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to a certain point could not dissemble i have learned some fine things concerning your musketeers and i said tréville coldly i have some pretty things to tell your majesty concerning these gownsmen what said the king with hauteur				1250099.220290603
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated				588937.0838672672
let each take seventy five that is enough to take us to london and back				1167.4050093709882
well how is it with this madman exclaimed he turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the host who came in to inquire if he was unhurt				124733.33890111605
behind the grating of the room into which andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of m bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other grating				24032.58345491318
towards the evening of the third day				597.2722771333408

she cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was cruel				135901.41094294572
aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction				2094.35175390541
is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward athos was seized with a kind of vertigo				27146.345885202627
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other that s exactly the reason i won t go said d artagnan				1.473147170197929
i am obliged to you guitant although your intention was perhaps not very favorable to me for such an opportunity he turned away and went off to his post whistling a tune then popular among the party called the fronde whilst mazarin returned in a pensive mood toward the palais royal				2971.3957509746538
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper				3303.7193348717965
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the château d if were interred in an ordinary burial ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman				1699.1653467557032
you ll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff before i shall be a captain come dear d artagnan look up a little				1232.6785824291214
he imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one meets in dreams				4303.683662483972
see how deadly pale he is				1238.6549463546992
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as d artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but d artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line				2483.143978048825
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting				9554.178592382712
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow				1714.3769520113015
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman				734.2571516822668
is our little neighbor worse asked d artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth				3635.8316002002866
monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time i came here it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands				297.0357270368929
hers had been accomplished it remains possibly for us to accomplish ours i have sometimes thought as you do athos she had a son that unhappy woman yes have you ever heard of him never he must be about twenty three years of age said athos in a low tone				1056.8771251831965

all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of d artagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done before				517.7831583760454
the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal				4358.1905581345145
so much the better are we then to go to war by my troth yes against whom are you a politician friend not in the least are you for mazarin or for the princes i am for no one that is to say you are for us				188.3922723968748
on grand occasions you must wear your uniform that will look very well				773.2997232356778
no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the dispute a proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse				162365.97720859386

the queen as he went on looked at him with increasing astonishment				1015.0268703532216
how very singular cried monte cristo with well feigned astonishment				763.1033502325175
and perhaps my god added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish half past seven had sounded				9732.913324435418
project gutenberg is a registered trademark				1187.2775385164211

good journey to him with all his millions he will not have enough to pay for his shroud said another				533.9809808086936
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared				460.06451504016326
the star of day pale but nevertheless still splendid was setting in the horizon glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration				120254.63290201535
vain and indiscreet it was as easy to see through him as through a crystal				162216.7759337263
in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees				2870.5209334196616
felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment				607.5206448864733
covered with flames assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened she flew to the windows but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was assunta calling for help				3197.2716015652495

now supposing i am deceived supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit happiness				3279.648100867636
had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale				805.0363656927971
aramis looked after them and as the last of them passed close to him he pressed the hand of athos				241.08380585356292

they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate				306393.5236871752
how do you mean the receipt of m de monte cristo is as good as money take it to rothschild s or lafitte s and they will take it off your hands at once what though payable at rome certainly it will only cost you a discount of 5 000 or 6 000 francs the receiver started back				1146.93007345729
one more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throw only one the last done for twenty replied groslow				2770.258243869036
it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher				198993.7754063887
the little troop without looking behind them or exchanging a word fled at a rapid gallop fording a little stream of which none of them knew the name and leaving on their left a town which athos declared to be durham				168352.8395279329
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage				1634.0471899630863
the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters				168157.07782212674
your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if monsieur de tréville heard you you would repent of speaking thus are you going to give me a lesson porthos cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning				1816.4297569330772
sir said he with compressed lips and flashing eyes you have not the presumption to instruct the comte de la fere and myself what we ought to say here during this brief altercation athos with his hands on his heart his head bent low approached the queen and in a voice of deepest sorrow said madame princes who by nature are above other men receive from heaven courage to support greater misfortunes than those of lower rank for their hearts are elevated as their fortunes				9452.590891338896
valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then m de villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs				24660.09778264296
what is this rent said he showing d artagnan a place where it had been pierced through				6366.251885158898
now as a half smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined				18274.79739760547
tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative but today i wish to nurse you carefully				13131.873198797355

madame more hopeless than he thinks				224722.0171841472
when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen				176658.54596025666
then i must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my departure porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice				10369.627614412057
and what have you done to aspire to this honor demanded the lieutenant				1659.0612127532468
in fact a moment later m morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own				815.8739519938498
you see said porthos this is my usual style devil take me answered d artagnan i wish you joy of it				111.51328737156183
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last those are kind and cheering words				652.8784382495638
i wager that i uttered a thousand extravagances while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed him				70.33225913623697
i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him				18.610422817667555
i leave you alone in your struggle with misfortune alone with that strong winged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his feet				1414.4365894993891

you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy change of scene and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity				13420.562228152241
now in the opinion of d artagnan it was certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off mme				420.09128405067503
this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was				1779.2085544000674

let me see it said milady				103.31086186905817
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum				51681.033981064764
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany but instead of that you come to paris how does that annoy you it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose so said andrea you are speculating upon me what fine words he uses i warn you master caderousse that you are mistaken well well don t be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous				625680.892773833

do you know what those three windows were worth two or three hundred roman crowns two or three thousand the deuce does his island produce him such a revenue it does not bring him a bajocco then why did he purchase it for a whim he is an original then in reality observed albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at paris and a frequenter of the theatres i should say he was a poor devil literally mad				2960.5425453674306
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d artagnan all for one one for all that s well				663.8703864689824
the name of one of the four friends is caderousse the innkeeper shivered				180459.03653753083

there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and i will say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land				2391.263712649436
athos without saying anything emptied his pockets got together all his jewels purses aiguillettes and gold chains and offered them all to porthos but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings				2813200.8581621638

as we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to him				17.783653380986554

fine sport are you still bent on departure athos asked d artagnan				1.5515818621085193
only the felucca had disappeared from the surface of the sea and groslow and his three sailors were consumed				18513.347090194988
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent				1439.080302977604
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel				5275.1311446491045
i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment				3376.7599566804233

0313m two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht				4310.6789858393695
these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies can not hear us but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets yes said athos that s grimaud s business well then cried d artagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls heaven forfend said athos they may serve us these bodies serve us said porthos				448.515910886042
the heart of d artagnan swam in delirium he marched between athos and porthos pressing them tenderly				10157.691499639273
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the house				585.3539467836132
i shut my eyes and i can see you as you then were i open them again and i see what you are now a hundred times more beautiful what folly murmured anne of austria who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances and upon what then must i live				2659.7179461465676
d artagnan dismissed planchet and requested his visitor to be seated				10473.06741699212

now this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer to our readers restoring it to the title which belongs to it and entering into an engagement that if of which we have no doubt this first part should obtain the success it merits we will publish the second immediately				2679.912513380173
but monte cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes				661.7578805951669
you must be cruelly bored here that was my intention but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you what s that it is that as i was cruelly bored as you say and as i had the seventy five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed a cast of dice				2692.734687542056
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which d artagnan is blindly governed				1181403.8279120296
but on the following day the family from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishing boat with two seines and a tender				164256.55386909077
i swear it before heaven and the queen raised her eyes solemnly upward				1695271.17539538
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat				1684.4003203507382
at this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the window				798.696111531493
the young people felt a mutual esteem but the queen who at first sanctioned their affection changed her mind and monsieur the duc d orleans who had encouraged the familiarity between them has forbidden his daughter to think any more about the union				261395.08082276644
she screamed aloud then running to the door exclaimed help help 50083m what is the matter asked m d avrigny at the foot of the stairs it being the hour he usually visited her				535.181598033773
in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years for change of air will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty				2722.732915457472
welcome to ye thanks my lord				658.6513403560073
as to the commencement of an intrigue between her and m de wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinal s favor				2805.471125836117
the next day was spent as usual				2158.9323967707455
50265m give way said the traveller				153434.86995383262
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara				125356.19070797905
the petition finished villefort read it aloud				3882.796175264968
i can not thus in a moment relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a father s untarnished name inspires a son				1100.1748193753003
i do not reproach you athos for what you have done				1782.414971197549
comte de la fere you wish to perish by his hands				317.58515979571604
napoleon is the mahomet of the west and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers not only as a leader and lawgiver but also as the personification of equality he cried the marquise napoleon the type of equality				182627.15517403823
did i ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to marie de medici never				8969.279178222645
remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue				2373.272559214261
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms				542.2172192314234
she suited me in every respect and i would have married her and he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after madame danglars departure before he left the house				663.627630825158
this was julie who had become as the clerk of the house of thomson french had predicted madame emmanuel herbault				61020.709293442254
ah my head oh what agony shall i suffer like this long no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer ah i understand you said the unhappy man				103.29864550186869
oh my god my god have pity on me without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of m bonacieux lamentations to which besides they must have been pretty well accustomed the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm and led him away while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and dispatched it by an officer in waiting				8019.900095770365
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says				5177.661392328608
if so depend on it you will be happy me said the young girl he never even glances at me on the contrary if i accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me				101.90685403042782
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand				269.65353411694565
availing himself of a handle that projected from a half fallen door he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow then advancing to the door struck thrice with the end of his iron shod stick				161435.2538060483
no you do all this not i still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders				705.8181617989983
heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o clock				904.1445001913157
at this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat				1647.398832758278
he who returned to france with millions had been unable to find the grave of his father who had perished from hunger				2303.4464820643866
at your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly				165256.01553239237
monsieur said d artagnan you must excuse famished travelers				79962.4447389353
and you what are you doing here replied d artagnan				1.4762593708138192
the only question was had she ten or twelve				15028.539396673732
you know the vessel is lost the pharaon sir they signal the pharaon				8090.127211756436

bring them here the waiter did as he was desired				2829.279235992889
suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth the whole accompanied by cries that were never heard in any other part of the world				972.0311541386634
well said franz to him there is the beginning of an adventure laugh if you please i really think so				206.75477558795583
and now said d artagnan to the governor s but you are wounded it seems said planchet				587.0374939929076
now said d artagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure of it i hope the accident has been of no consequence they don t yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured at this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper				3896.5509193022276
do not seek to know how i discovered it i know it that is sufficient				5250.472847201481
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength				4247.727138828448
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions				76185.37813007254
what is it said d artagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance				8052.686670521744
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to milady				229.49180242240837
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death be easy said d artagnan he will know all before night the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead				153086.1309055974
she joined her hands with a suppliant air but without venturing to speak a word				930.4786037135619
try me gentlemen said he and i swear to you by my honor that i will not go hence if we are conquered what is your name my brave fellow said athos				14.446392464368113
at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten				16546.33058969009
no he went out early this morning replied the valet				7859.487657928818
monsieur bertuccio said the count did you never tell me that you had travelled in france in some parts of france yes excellency you know the environs of paris then no excellency no returned the steward with a sort of nervous trembling which monte cristo a connoisseur in all emotions rightly attributed to great disquietude				28371.20380162092
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind				675.620922050542
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke someone will come she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner				1277.042055236441
d artagnan picked up two or three old sails hung on the walls and meeting nothing to suspect regained by the hatchway the deck of the vessel				5180.3383731806925
the host stood at the door				272.58804277246963
the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man				425.09061609330894
they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach				15076.571974748324
well i vow i felt exactly the same sensation at sight of that man when he said why do you ask me that and looked so strangely at me then you regret that you did not cut your serpent in two morsels faith yes almost said raoul				260.18422117434335
mousqueton is propped against the door and here s the key bravo said aramis how did you manage it like everything else with money but it cost me dear how much asked athos				455.245454881355
yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him				11.03099100309003
read it obeying the queen athos read aloud the letter which we have already seen in which king charles demanded to know whether the hospitality of france would be accorded him				17.365098963097044
we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again why said dantès if in two or three days you hail any fishing boat desire them to come here to me				45.03110605116213
my dear landlady said d artagnan i beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from flanders and whom i am going to take into my service my brother wish your sister good morning master peter wilkom suster said planchet				1056.6332375176848
a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed				3418.52944809122
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold				1645.2839440470932
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple				10821.378898518189
the burning marseilles sun which shot into the room through the open door covered them with a flood of light				2106.5689623935614
have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel on entering the roadstead sent forward in order to obtain permission to enter the port a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of his voyagers				160309.46363852842
will you go away from here demanded the swiss stamping violently like a man who begins to be seriously angry				8260.507728834431
the marshal raised his hand in token of assent				1888.6728134913847
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house				785.6088981620477
i forgot to mention to you said the count that i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a matter of course all participation in this money while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it will be divided at my death				536.6852707572242
make the requisite inquiries for a place of this description and when you have met with an eligible spot visit it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own name				827.0214716262194
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter				537.0073039762069
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away				884.9372503117444
we left paris each with seventy five pistoles in his pocket shall i see you again before your departure i think not monsieur unless something new should happen well a pleasant journey thanks monsieur d artagnan left m de tréville touched more than ever by his paternal solicitude for his musketeers				833.671645887968
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting				313920.0862666213
as to athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating d artagnan by a look				1262.307312291446
the foundation s business office is located at 809 north 1500 west salt lake city ut 84116 801 596 1887				17481.45883147325
and am i not a hundred times better thus cried eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so oh you are beautiful always beautiful cried louise				127038.67627658311
m de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court				1046.8338881410828
during this time exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief the royal army led a joyous life neither provisions nor money being wanting in the camp				1583.84534424152
stop but it is very strange oh my god my head swims				291575.5834369842
it is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the cardinal monsieur de tréville must think us dead to a certainty athos said aramis you were meant to be a general of the army				2575.2393926459777
athos went close to it and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice				137869.7232230685
in spite of his usual command over himself dantès could not restrain his impetuosity				291686.2755647345
monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to ali he whispered remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you ali bowed in token of strict obedience				15257.199636723708
at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself				511.75348610927506
one by one the several groups broke up				632.592967641439
fine vengeance that on my faith a cold sweat broke from d artagnan s brow				664.8416633289967
i had provided myself with a dark lantern				34453.00345596546
caligula or nero those treasure seekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the liberty he so earnestly prayed for				1160.0762740863129
ah then you wish to ask advice of me yes i do wish to ask your advice said madame danglars with anxious expectation				5778.820526943812
we will hasten on to the inn you will meanwhile proceed on foot to the harbor				13735.795377691411
the king and his escort were no longer there				767.1578376485361
this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs d eau c est bien prouvé par le déluge 1 you said sir you would like to help me but yes but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die death alone can separate them remarked fernand				3240.165687134666
my father has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still i shall love you as i loved my father it is well returned the voice tomorrow these few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his sincerity dantès rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his bed back against the wall				997.1189126032288
the executioner walked behind them and lord de winter d artagnan porthos and aramis walked behind the executioner				1900.9778517118714
at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat				1710.9159757711907
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain she believes in dreams				4570.682220477553
the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily				24866.97579684734

there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man				447.40367608075263
you are somewhat blasé i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others				1405.1268227793787
at once if you please and you know who i am without doubt i				1521.0527522122386
you have a quick ear monsieur athos said the cardinal but now listen to this				1234.298411049953
you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairs on the expulsion of don carlos				548398.7346459087
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambition fernand and danglars how was this jealousy manifested				284400.2607282376
this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall				21826.72691081024
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter				843.1239255851647
oh yes said she smiling but we won t tell him in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper				3197.1160984006556
speak gentlemen speak i am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing				445.3675255044936
then he looked about for something to pour the soup into dantès entire dinner service consisted of one plate there was no alternative				103628.01668189991
at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished				11422.505714459268
only as our gascon was not easily intimidated or rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty				2736.6484828858274
then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course				2438.038841542808
it was time for athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his knee				5205.7196719703725
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir yes and much more what more will you say i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you				24.558860186833055

yes sir by whom inquired cromwell				6399.951654481917

her dress which was that of the women of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls				4465.488066270644
jesus dieu he cried one of them is trembling with fever having failed to adapt himself to this charming country of yours and the other is a knight of malta as timid as a young girl and for greater security we have taken from them even their penknives and pocket scissors well then said groslow bring them with you but really said d artagnan				349.57080914475216

athos lifted his finger and grimaud was silent				1452.4406309152318

gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose				2777.403279369123
athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men ill disposed to allow themselves to be taken				3543.1703197807883
de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismounted				206974.66572196624
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy				2607.7047817353805
take this pen and paper and write what i dictate i don t know how to write reverend sir you lie				276204.63067104924
i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday oh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rival s attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly pale				989.1319078995786
it was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action from all sides				5114.32956569802
but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered				46074.11579508586
answer me do not these crimes exist yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance				2343.801799528582
you have seduced this young girl you have outraged defiled her				225.42388840763357
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success				31348.792314138547
she stretched out her arms to him but they seized hold of her and one of the three none other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed put her to torture and she ll soon tell us where her money is it unfortunately happened that our neighbor wasilio was at bastia leaving no person in his house but his wife no human creature beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling				34254.36662649034

athos and aramis left paris after this coup d etat which took place on the very evening of the day in which the parisians had been beaten at charenton				108281.66819338243
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit				1561.8424840687844
you would love me then if you were not queen				464.64735602846815

oh i can not behold this frightful spectacle said he				28.933676930905285

you can not beat me said he you have no right for you are not my father 20299m we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this answer in which the child s whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my arm fell without touching him				120.60175304196075
or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another what is that break his arm wound him but do not kill him i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i and you that will be another thing i shall be brought home no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings				4302.341761519787
upon this promise d artagnan withdrew and the next day he began service				972.3612225740753
do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come today to plead for justice				1925.281725894605
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it i will do it captain but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshal s presence as easily as you expect here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain				1034.9586336012505
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur				20073.77151235314
the notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said gentlemen we are about to sign the contract the baron was to sign first then the representative of m cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents				18976.84890700114
but it s all my fault yes it s all my fault because it is myself who selects my men				511.23666235492414
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground				1297.5787789258884
seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count				503.43332608240047
drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it				176.79310729829794
0243m i awoke as the clock was striking six				3488.0522684648304
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind				677.0828580112297
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before then meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos				19.124289058835725
only we conspire against the rochellais ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his eminence				3743.8615154204685
a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon				3463.8996472603985
well what do you see from this window				1001.5543613197923
in consequence he brought them the key of his own at least such was the apparent motive of his visit				1571.9724400175855
please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you to which of us asked all the four friends				532.4427377479462
so no more delay no more hesitation or else whatever may be my repugnance to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you i swear by my faith as an honest man and at these words d artagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up				807.6131860896155
what could put such an idea into your head yourself ah what next most assuredly i should like to know upon what occasion oh mon dieu that is very easily done				2089.884504310446
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state				9260.183263759745
when i look at this room whence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when i look at that chair before which i now sit trembling and ashamed oh it requires all my reason to convince me that i am not a very guilty woman and you a menacing judge villefort dropped his head and sighed				1279.9597754231875
and he had five millions in your hands alone				828.2247331898783
let us take a turn around the town and imbibe a little fog yes said porthos twill be at least a little change from beer chapter lxiii				32941.50554934652

these conditions being agreed to porthos took leave of mme				244.1478841168468
besides you will strike at the throat porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry very good said porthos it will be a nice little throat cutting horrible horrible exclaimed athos				414.0874860689868
i will send word to the governor very well returned dantès dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad				3098.2636075085934
blacas remain ah sir said the minister of police to villefort as they left the tuileries you entered by luck s door your fortune is made will it be long first muttered villefort saluting the minister whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackney coach				14627.549805275417
not at all i assure you but where will you manage to stow me in the chamber overhead surely that is where you yourselves sleep never mind that we have a second bed in the adjoining room caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment				1174.9985336850955

she is amiable and well behaved what is her name she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of kitty				2442.9800186727603
on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady and bound her hands and feet				1626.1902448789908
toward the middle of the town commanding the principal open space rose a dark mass separated from the rest of the world by two lanes and overshadowed in the front by enormous lime trees				2885.4270937036586
the little boat bounded over the waves like a nut shell				16054.560720589308
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host				809.9294116665144
this way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out				231.4160574697602
the royal procession set out for paris				280.0887629781137
father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat oh this is what i feared said morrel				176.55747310800203
this is a woman of twenty six or twenty eight years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall well made				4597.248420048613

0175m but said the abbé i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn				1624.1645389919108
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength				4228.665763427898
i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken i should be obliged to let them hang you at which i should be most unhappy certainly and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny				1059869.4232511786
what s the matter at the château d if said the captain				1051.4232981433568
her skin was admired for its velvety softness her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable				467243.3457957427
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought				1337.009508757719

what planchet is monsieur d artagnan here here i am my friend dear athos cried d artagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation				4437.346713047498
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon				3250.025598828793
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor				124913.92420541354
there are some situations which men understand by instinct but which reason is powerless to explain in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow				5054.162564801349
i will show you the way and he went in first				2338.6920683488124

de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us doubtless intending to frighten us to death yes said villefort really count you frighten the ladies what is the matter asked debray in a whisper of madame danglars				525.4059088146568
he made a sign which i understood but the king s guards must have noticed it and held themselves on guard				1095.106263488375
so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of a legion of cæsars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads he who dreads nothing as it is said				501.41730466090956
i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares 14 besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself				474.7900903412197

by the side of andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence and who had been appointed by the court for andrea disdained to pay any attention to those details to which he appeared to attach no importance				5135.159368066219
it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity				1557.9240933922886
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the 21st of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o clock				838.3388918795781
on the contrary there is not an hour we have passed together that is not present to my memory yes yes said porthos trying to give to his mustache a curl which it had lost whilst he had been alone				1247.7759002504297
meanwhile carried away as we are by our narrative we must leave our three friends to themselves and follow the duke of buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the louvre				6242.176781833811
my lord he said which way do we go				1384.713739022311
he found athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find him				18.04699420819324
aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal kissed the superscription with an almost religious respect and opened the epistle which contained what follows my friend it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time separated but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return				725.5681988785585
nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization of him who thinks				147360.97791098963
we listen monsieur athos yes the wager said the light horseman				252388.17647242724

have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence				1910.7755255710301
this adjoins the lower part of the governor s apartments and were we to work our way through we should only get into some lock up cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured				193316.46782769857
there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name				812.8299677806141
courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of la pierre in which the cardinal had established his residence				4359.815972274211
it followed that d artagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friends athos porthos and aramis				413.063975637878
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i don t stand upon ceremony said d artagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep				977.1798650228732
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me this threat brought no reply				822.372527671886
d artagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville the other was a convent of jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers				9741.317187159233
what shall i do he uttered and reflected for a moment shall i ring				4186.94823105563
at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited				3408.740178787451
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind				708.1351355601959
i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down				1062.1029470190224
the two rooms looked on to the street a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage				31062.29552123707
a galley slave escaped from confinement at toulon and what crime has he committed he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible voice of having assassinated the man named caderousse his former companion in prison at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the count of monte cristo monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him				14.898145242791315
at length i saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity				3785.324264693056
i shall faint again monte cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial				22150.68759032006
empty your pockets said he i want a hundred pounds and as for my own and he emptied them inside out				431.0329428551288
well m morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us yes yes poor captain leclere				19661.11911303352
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play				3498.786624964642
yes he is a terrible antagonist				376438.7059268362
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word i will keep it returned morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons				187219.42112059437
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as d artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time				812.7272635737336
it must have been charming indeed				793.0536886402147
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some house				705.450733591852
did i not tell you that she was the goddaughter of monsieur laporte the confidential man of the queen				474.85031591087903
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once				1005.2260111081813

la ramee i recommend monsieur le duc to you particularly treat him as a man of his rank and family ought to be treated that is never leave him alone an instant la ramee became therefore the duke s dinner guest by compulsion an eternal keeper the shadow of his person but la ramee gay frank convivial fond of play a great hand at tennis had one defect in the duke s eyes his incorruptibility				230842.10139484506
he is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in france				582.7163756344627
d artagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object				7303.121430080206
the sun already high penetrated into the room through the window the curtains of which raoul had neglected to close on the previous evening				719.2238782379916

thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame				3685.424655727424
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs				948.7944554232971
he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty				1602.781154333177
yonder is the house porthos said the gascon let me do what i please and do you what i do they glided from tree to tree till they arrived at twenty steps from the house unperceived and saw by means of a lantern suspended under a hut four fine horses				1749.8162873743222

i come from the cardinal said the officer				1607.862386888827
well asked anne of austria when d artagnan reappeared what does it mean it means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the palais royal oh this time it is too much exclaimed the queen and i will prove to them i have not left d artagnan saw from the expression of the queen s face that she was about to issue some violent command				3705.4493575062365
