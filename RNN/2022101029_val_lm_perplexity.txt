the carriage is at the door you bid me adieu you mount the step to embrace me a last time my brother s servant who comes to fetch me is told how to proceed he makes a sign to the postillion and we set off at a gallop but d artagnan				80.11383820546554
i actually love no one sir you know it do you not				591.7122195112289
the agent of thomson french had not been again seen at marseilles the day after or two days after his visit to morrel he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the inspector of prisons and m morrel his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three persons				9608.253342889368
in the name of heaven said maximilian if you know anything of him tell us what it is alas cried monte cristo striving to repress his emotion if lord wilmore was your unknown benefactor i fear you will never see him again				391.9701481468536
d artagnan half stupefied without his doublet and with his head bound up in a linen cloth arose then and urged by the host began to descend the stairs but on arriving at the kitchen the first thing he saw was his antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage drawn by two large norman horses				903.4553865555653
she corrupted this man she placed the poniard in his hand she made him kill the duke				666.1681334915786
upon a word from her i would betray my country i would betray my king i would betray my god				569.4512379958509
my dear sir said château renaud allow me to tell you that you do not understand that manœuvre with the eye glass half so well as debray				658.7794931504578
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart				360.6754609213533
recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us monte cristo started				3111.9178875658254
tell them yourself that i was taken by bandits and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the rue du helder ah said monte cristo you promised me never to mention that circumstance it was not i who made that promise cried morcerf it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner and whom you have forgotten				5114.471012391796
he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young girl who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier				5281.151362787869
well then read this paper which i have never shown to anyone tomorrow my dear friend said edmond desirous of not yielding to the old man s madness				3415.7040543624603
our valets are well armed and yours seems to be tough enough i have never seen him put to the test replied raoul but he is a breton which promises something yes yes resumed de guiche i am sure he can fire a musket when required				21888.67859489749
yes replied caderousse little albert but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education herself				1007.5995707532045
d artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night				877.9430179869341
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness				47939.11622300589
the dishes were of silver and the plates of japanese china				20175.452236392703
with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while kitty pushed the bolts				173246.9473734998
hey said the cardinal opening the door				212.8013692504797
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century				57939.049916405864
don t you see they are trying to catch your eye albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage				3448.2734281195803
mazarin sent us with a letter to general cromwell but how came you to fall into company with mordaunt whom i bade you distrust asked athos				152.84548794140068
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture				3262.6307123150063
read and answer or i will blow out your brains the sergeant saw that d artagnan was in earnest				10500.439995229186
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set				179731.66648815875
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side				823.4885240597871
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community				197148.84618269105
why did not the countess the proud mercédès the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour ah baron baron said albert you are not listening what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you oh don t worry about me sir mocker said danglars then turning to monte cristo he said but will you undertake to speak to the father willingly if you wish it but let it be done explicitly and positively				148247.03022108774
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading haydée aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing room				219.26137495351418
yes yes father tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards				147791.92308837496
what was there in it a letter addressed to monsieur de tréville captain of the musketeers indeed exactly as i have the honor to tell your excellency the host who was not endowed with great perspicacity did not observe the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the stranger				1692.173753477285
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to st germain				1534.6617729059758
i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m de villefort the procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color				9810.475068935684
certainly that is most in accord with your own principles replied milady frigidly				217906.1125110728
the count flew to her to help and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes he ripped them open with his poniard and in so doing laid bare her shoulder				1457.3468077841355
inspector continued the governor i can tell you the story as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five years that proves returned the abbé that you are like those of holy writ who having eyes see not and having ears hear not my dear sir the government is rich and does not want your treasures replied the inspector keep them until you are liberated the abbé s eyes glistened he seized the inspector s hand				231.95319075236537
turned around astonished that any one should dare to address him				50.362839303645536
by the baroness he was most graciously welcomed while eugénie received him with her accustomed coldness				34378.9578718325
come my dear bazin tell me where he is didn t you hear me tell you monsieur d artagnan that i don t know where he is yes certainly but to that i answer that it is impossible it is nevertheless the truth monsieur the pure truth the truth of the good god d artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided				256785.04317611034
besides the appearance of the caravan was formidable				40137.685233840835
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m				666.6320693955147
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity				68001.04338529297
i will join you again at marseilles well be it so let us part said mercédès folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere				218734.5651800894
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you like that is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached				4539.972489267285
anyone else would have hastened to receive him but villefort was a man of ability and he knew this would be a sign of weakness				4324.765628019013
porthos turned to look at his sword which was hanging on the wall aramis seized his knife d artagnan arose				5792.979359346147
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no no said morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first i do signified the old man				179.04255245904898
it depends on you only i listen i am waiting to hear sir the favor i have to ask of you is not to call me mousqueton but mouston since i have had the honor of being my lord s steward i have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me				126.05725421052689
he might be recognized not only by these signs but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a frenchman				47378.8012096502
till tomorrow evening then till tomorrow evening then replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital				5023.930567445235
he hastened to the rendezvous found the lackeys at their posts placed them as sentinels at all the outlets of the hôtel and came to find athos who had just received this information when his friends returned				1438.3949454739886
all therefore of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of europe				5446.486400888134
ah but you are joking my worthy man said d artagnan				80.14111854518691
that s wise not for the lackeys resumed aramis but for the master for the masters we may say				954.3555545080758
there are many stories related of him and among them this				1451.2741062501366
let me propose it then said d artagnan				80.23705550891334
rely on me d artagnan knew that although a gascon m de tréville was not in the habit of making promises and that when by chance he did promise he more than kept his word				527.2573456253132
dear grandfather said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no friend in the world but you his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness				55636.92416944946
i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you				95.71167932549349
well it is just for that reason that we have called you my good m mouston				22228.96525719659
the door was closed and the carriage proceeded				12574.934099962064
villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return he could read no other expression on their features				5873.127398996402
then you know what i have suffered said mme				194.71098347530838
a gendarme was crossing the court				911.057661262931
the assizes the benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation				10988.887526372197
behind this man could be seen the glistening muskets of half a dozen soldiers				3864.333003150417
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair				1469.88391792838
his life is dependent on the information he has given us if it is true he shall be free if false let him be shot the prisoner was led away				594.844449536501
but amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme				194.54940665581788
i hold this serpent in my hands				484.72805772136746
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it d artagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you				95.69757794886681
then in the evening i shall go to the theatre i shall look like some retired baker				196376.86461080005
tis well order four men to conduct them to my lodging four men prepared to do so				430.4734357127576
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly				7269.454816358036
here laporte said buckingham these are the only tokens i ever received from her this silver casket and these two letters				7380.426055558954
grief had made her blind to all but one object that was edmond				2926.988938169041
it was worn by my father a loyal gentleman				1837.023802482459
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle d armilly s fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantio s malediction on desdemona				37237.554159417436
that s true said he quietly for my part i have never loved acknowledge then you stony heart said d artagnan that you are wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts tender hearts				4105.957490005028
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear				1573.4572991076366
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristo s opinion the villains sought his life not his money				609.366731492448
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot				2199.102487646337
nothing betokened that the man knew anything of what had occurred				41539.393906069236
whose then is the air we breathe				167415.25710024423
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door				212.24704283637553
planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow d artagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself				264.2318795467692
is it not some bad affair you are mistaken planchet replied d artagnan and as a proof there is a crown to drink my health i am much obliged to monsieur for the crown he has given me and i promise him to follow his instructions exactly but it is not the less true that letters which come in this way into shut up houses fall from heaven my friend fall from heaven then monsieur is satisfied asked planchet				662.2885340489573
do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness				231224.59517785665
the same impression was experienced by all present and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance				1217.6181921033885
i only wait till you give them you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes i will ruin the queen will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made yes for i have the proofs i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation without doubt				6752.041956844642
the reason of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the matter a secret and begged me not to tell you anything of it				88.82724200292431
most probably morrel and château renaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces but it was not the case with debray				658.7769801109199
well i would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future son in law how would you set about it ah that would be easy enough i would give her a lesson a lesson yes				867.2253336220888
the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket the major part of which arose from his winnings la vieuville said he take my place i must speak to monsieur de tréville on an affair of importance				5734.691557295566
la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband but as he made no sign of changing his position she extended her hard bony hand and touched him on the forehead				2464.6519261005806
are you ready sir he said at last				2113.569813707099
the soldiers looked at dantès with an air of stupid curiosity				3155.0025256579374
i know what i am saying continued the marchioness i must hurry you so that as she has no mother she may at least have a grandmother to bless her marriage				16781.863801211257
what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion				18714.63146796456
i went to france with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life				469.183440922558
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten you are mistaken my friend replied the abbé god may seem sometimes to forget for a time while his justice reposes but there always comes a moment when he remembers and behold a proof as he spoke the abbé took the diamond from his pocket and giving it to caderousse said here my friend take this diamond it is yours what for me only cried caderousse ah sir do not jest with me this diamond was to have been shared among his friends				429.70458192216194
yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is madame de longueville with whom i am in love a plague on t				32640.266171410756
five hundred pounds and where did you get so much money said athos				152.86276204818225
there were only chimeras and illusions but for real love for true jealousy is there any reality except illusions and chimeras				153221.08910270155
for the first time in his life danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire the time had come when the implacable spectre which exists in the mind of every human creature arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart thou shalt die danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase first it flies then despairs and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers				217947.26306578118
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining room or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the question in favor of the lawn				30720.55882240605
do you think you can behead me with a single blow asked the king				425.04075506343014
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo				202.1432592490653
during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay at last comminges appeared pushing broussel before him				50.340906494213556
you do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like that				539.1785037627428
thou seest simpleton said d artagnan to his servant that they wished no harm to us but to whom then i faith				2131.130203823914
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground				1793.3819653785233
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something				3241.593610693451
i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses indeed said monte cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent				28182.5976248793
suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment				29426.921222129684
everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular				17904.384452576738
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them				157.70559632030805
on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the baron s equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle				8638.0853438604
in a corner almost hidden from view were three gentlemen who had preceded athos and aramis and an officer was examining their passports				171083.2872716274
put it up again my friend said d artagnan				80.18744761832555
i am no relation of yours you are my son dantès exclaimed the old man				179.0526268912199
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair				36852.6837296387
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step				1544.1014250290416
i have charged myself with this affair				1233.300029834456
the king has nothing like it no answered porthos i hear it said that he is very badly fed by the cardinal monsieur de mazarin				778.4715300555298
a mournful answer awaited each of edmond s eager inquiries as to the information jacopo had obtained				17782.578171255944
is he at liberty asked the queen				376.70945307880726
yes monsieur the one with which i gather my fruit lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you				95.69712162834361
if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france				587.9647650419347
the commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone else				3567.031926160092
there was no one like him for that and now replied d artagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us				454.0383679959791
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough				1530.8042744371548
for all evils there are two remedies time and silence				714.1108812528626
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba then said monte cristo you went to him monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out				528.1138602690124
let your majesty mount on horseback and place yourself in the midst of us we will cross the tyne reach scotland and you will be saved is this your counsel also winter inquired the king				424.99900601742826
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault château renaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees				2846.866648791086
if you wish it i am at your service my lord i protest my dear la ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that i would stay forever at vincennes to have the pleasure of your society my lord replied la ramee i think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled what do you mean				15615.632797690954
felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless				185970.03462895888
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent				44851.61534381442
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched				12712.72056952551
after a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder belt then looked with great complacency at his hands which were most elegant and of which he took the greatest care and throwing on one side the large kid gloves tried on at first as belonging to the uniform he put on others of silk only				5330.8115896949585
as for me replied athos to this recital i am quite at my ease it will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit handsome well bred noble lord as you are my dear athos neither princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations how young this d artagnan is said athos shrugging his shoulders and he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle				45851.70430509789
and yet that villain benedetto will escape no one i tell you will escape benedetto will be punished then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priest you should have prevented benedetto from killing me i said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast				1465.9173062060684
and why i should like to know persisted caderousse should they put dantès in prison				867.8429466594487
it is well sir replied villefort from below it is well have patience but one day longer what i have said i will do noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words and turned his eyes with indifference to the other side				823.4877387203063
in a court of justice that is called an alibi d artagnan found his advice prudent				36954.67614256871
they arrived at amiens at midnight and alighted at the auberge of the golden lily				181876.12880053392
confess monsieur mordaunt that you are anxious to kill some of us all replied mordaunt				1926.651937682699

the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter s absence				16941.881995347445
why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear planchet and no one could find fault with it ah monsieur replied planchet recurring to his besetting idea that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips what the devil makes you think of bonacieux monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we will because you are a coward planchet monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a virtue and you are very virtuous are you not planchet monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder				48421.75464095632

she ran to the window and opened it				88.99670088921029
thirty five or thirty six mother so young it is impossible said mercédès replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private reflection				6768.0560119292895

credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next month to m de boville m morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor				12519.0302801002
we every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork and some meat when he asks for it but alas				2084.935603169369
it is not i who strike m de morcerf it is providence which punishes him and why do you represent providence cried mercédès				1363.1683890337167
suppose we warn the masters let s wait for grimaud but perhaps they have killed him grimaud would have cried out you know he is almost dumb we should have heard the blow then but if he doesn t return here he is at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them				157.7055211204376
yes if my friends agree but if they refuse can i count on you i have never accomplished anything alone said d artagnan shaking his head				426.9298201777028

you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart				360.67769671328665
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queen s letter short but explicit gave him the clue				204408.30259976618
d artagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself				264.2386833956074
grimaud made a sign that he was going away				595.0311165296537

have you any money d artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket				1334.3116326600934
and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner the name of m noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange the father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics				13457.74308771137
be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear to me from the moment i am not obliged to see an enemy in you				95.69730415629178

sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper and how did this despatch reach you inquired the king				424.9994113282581
d artagnan dressed himself and athos did the same				1671.0411976332366
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night				877.9459484428012
madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their example				1687.8301934384244
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph				227558.1773067377
what is his name said he				209.7524848792059
how should i know what horse furniture is you should have left it to me then madame who know what they are but you wished to be frugal and consequently to lend at usury it was wrong monsieur porthos but i will repair that wrong upon my word of honor how so asked the musketeer				997.7058070279057
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me but i can not leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped				2091.721924810456
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied d artagnan				80.12285420892401
give me the pocket book la carconte and find a bag somewhere la carconte went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern pocket book and a bag				20580.029733481864
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse d artagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st germain				1534.6405513237057
my weapons what weapons my military weapons yes my lord at any rate i think so make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up				1256.5085806558295

then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a corner				6408.978943056497
into what room did you take him into the blue drawing room according to your excellency s orders that s right now bring the alicante and some biscuits baptistin left the room				219.26074764258593
all eyes were turned towards this man for to all except athos he was unknown				25237.31253434046
however as they were fighting in a room and had not space to go on like that forever mordaunt s foot at last touched the wall against which he rested his left hand				231.95352256430365
do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin				778.4715300555298

lord de winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal we shall not be compromised				158960.1718691328
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter				2363.0046099125598
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now it is for something else than that i imagine muttered d artagnan shaking his head doubtfully				53313.83724886411
at length the hour drew near				4298.199693516137
as for eugénie she was as strong as a judith or a delilah				41447.351416793324
he remembered that all the first part of his life had been embittered by a woman and he thought with alarm of the influence love might assume over so fine and at the same time so vigorous an organization as that of raoul				841.511709261822
at all events she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands of her brother in law with whom she reckoned she could deal very easily rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent enemy				1429.880352627849
the prisoners sometimes through mere uneasiness of life and in order to be sentenced to death commit acts of useless violence and you might fall a victim take all needful precautions replied the inspector				2297.8099703030025

the door of their cabin was opened				1678.6841381148706
as to dantès he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it				88.82919040625666
the young man with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the circumstances in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted				32611.516398769865
morrel followed him and looked also for his sister and brother in law he soon discovered them in another box and kissed his hand to them				157.70649872155042

near the bottom of the ladder when he found no more support for his feet he clung with his hands at length arrived at the last step he let himself hang by the strength of his wrists and touched the ground				1793.3819653785233
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box yes what do you think of her oh she is perfectly lovely what a complexion				7694.927111948577
you here rochefort he said in a low voice				412.9682621021531
his father yes his father replied the abbé his right name was noirtier de villefort at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before				775.2102989351009
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head				426.9320595196
his long dark hair softly powdered here and there with silver tendrils fell elegantly over his shoulders in wavy curls his voice was still youthful as if belonging to a hercules of twenty five and his magnificent teeth which he had preserved white and sound gave an indescribable charm to his smile				397.4944035188306
she thought it was best to preserve silence to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with her usual skill and then all things being accomplished to the satisfaction of the cardinal to come to him and claim her vengeance				1144.674149523277
the queen saving monsieur de buckingham her lover nothing more just				36558.46689776674
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house				465.29520886293477

ah but what is the matter with your hand d artagnan				80.14111854518691
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied dantès and i hope he fully understood it yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one s patrons i hope to be captain without that said dantès				540.5959581896118

everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow				261581.3636422728
the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out long live the duke de beaufort one day another long live the prince de conde and again long live the parliament and at this word the smile on the cardinal s lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable				236750.37178599875

oh said valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear m d avrigny				937.0058393288599
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian				181751.46057118554

madame replied de winter provided i can find some of my good old friends of former times i will answer for anything come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much come and may heaven hear you chapter xxxvii				217947.26306578118
they waited ten minutes and then his lordship began to fear aramis was not coming to join them				157.71131161538455
he resolved then to defend the door bravely and as betrayed by the mistress of the inn he could not say that aramis was absent he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference which had commenced with the morning and would not as bazin said terminate before night				877.9425993511802
here i am smiled porthos with his sublime composure				15689.463745771487
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them i countenance nothing that is marvellous m albert				433.80148136526395
my clothes were near me on a chair i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed				692.0353850499789
at the first word the cardinal spoke of mme				194.7192468941015
five minutes after m de tréville was asking d artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour				1300.2792643912032
i wish to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercédès you have had too much already drunkard said danglars and if you continue you will be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs i said caderousse rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken man i can t keep on my legs				60017.80718311551
no i want to live i shall struggle to the very last i will yet win back the happiness of which i have been deprived				210512.31273941806
i will take him dead that s all a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse				232959.2294340385
nevertheless monsieur de tréville s company of musketeers alone can not maintain a war against the cardinal who disposes of the forces of all france and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will				1730.438334204477
0209m since my imprisonment said faria i have thought over all the most celebrated cases of escape on record				185104.43546632762
a light cloud passed over the count s face				673.3185023972051
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand				231.95319075236537
he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine				1527.858866424938
well said franz to him there is the beginning of an adventure laugh if you please i really think so				430.4683041001002
chevalier take my hand it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh aramis stooped to kiss the king s hand but charles clasped his and pressed it to his heart				360.6756329048561
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess two years exclaimed dantès do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned				34040.08743589767
now sir continued morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like valentine				683.545487821524
no no you do yourselves injustice but i am here to do you justice				2336.304582378483
and yet as he journeyed along a profound sadness weighed upon his heart				360.71089125459304
in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants we have forgotten to mention that the count s coachman was attired in a bear skin exactly resembling odry s in the bear and the pasha and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed				3828.859824566977
but after all he was somewhat to blame in all that business and we may console ourselves with the reflection that france has no cause of reproach in the matter and did all she could to serve him oh				1081.7447319777293
near the barrels stood selim my father s favorite whom i mentioned to you just now				1201.9443131436083
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the château d if were interred in an ordinary burial ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman				2182.3448003955277
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word				527.2726822179144
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph				5624.056841232662
if you mean to buy any horses get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it at what hour shall we come asked the young man				179.0427232074142
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh				1081.7112044518617
you have to do with that woman				932.7432703749453
well tempter what more do you want with me said d artagnan				80.14348786452969
let them try to pursue him				50.73966658073299
and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you				95.70319086928409
this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was performing a make up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from one side were the image of geniality and from the other showed lips drawn down in chronic ill temper				25441.825711633326
coward he is a coward indeed grumbled the host drawing near to d artagnan and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before				775.2102989351009
sometimes on a sunday i take a ride in the fields and on the property of my neighbours in order to pick up a nice little quarrel which i am really in want of but nothing happens				200846.3922437165
he was not deceived it was she whom he sought				7806.666044117768
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winter s neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign s confidence and friendship				6118.897374889004
this costume is a fancy one it appears and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my mother the same as she was in 1830				217946.63951455182
it was very natural he being the only person in the whole assemblage except the king the queen and the duke of orleans who slept gratuitously				217946.01596510646
madame said the president you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the affair at yanina and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the event i was indeed said the stranger with a tone of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the east				15397.333955245214
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else woman woman why do you have such ideas cried caderousse or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man what do you mean added caderousse				528.750855984908
i have blessed you and you are sacred to me				126.11653540520922
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand				231.9537437725262
as the service was drawing to a close a boy entered the church in great excitement ran to the sacristy dressed himself quickly in the choir robes and cleaving thanks to that uniform the crowd that filled the temple approached bazin who clad in his blue robe was standing gravely in his place at the entrance to the choir				197869.13115545997
ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal				411.56642018650854
well to morrow i am on guard in stuart s room yes come and pass the night with me impossible impossible				2925.6479805321
take courage vasiliki said he today arrives the firman of the master and my fate will be decided				256765.20790889213
the general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by his wife and son				1000.8210695688003
he brought it to bear skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning and struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove irresistible				177813.66227814747
why was i a prisoner i do not know said mercédès				1363.440770156759
the new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor				4851.283354211253
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one				372.0613647758099
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars villefort complied and they passed on to the dining room				219.26513885677363
there said d artagnan we can t be overtaken				188130.79021552595
then m de tréville unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man requested m de la trémouille to interrogate him himself				264.23238352956406
the 28th of february in what year in what year you ask me in what year yes replied the young man i ask you in what year you have forgotten then i got such a fright last night replied dantès smiling that i have almost lost my memory				2797.678854992596
d artagnan rushed out of the room				219.85215620380905
in a quarter of an hour athos joined them and at the same moment charles brought in a letter for d artagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered				184644.44290213287
why did her father ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment				4619.905018271831
where do you keep your wine no no thanks				13577.218640329847
i wished to live said athos				153.51586854375861
you allow me to give you this title continued the count in french it is necessary to excite this man s confidence you can speak before me said franz i am a friend of the count s good returned peppino				4840.5293226278345
therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm				10987.095623300665
then d artagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers				3864.5762416042753
what has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a misfortune				4379.481057627327
the groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porter s lodge saying pray does not the count of monte cristo live here his excellency does reside here replied the concierge but added he glancing an inquiring look at ali				11202.867130427614
this man in whom milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman had become an admirable jailer				7284.229512370305
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole				191582.2666198928
well my dear porthos said d artagnan that s the very thing it came into my head to do athos understood all now				1201.9339968170905
bon jour messieurs said the king to the two gentlemen who were held by d artagnan and porthos				145.04639289873944
i was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves				32020.059707961595
the clock striking eight awoke her				165.66145048313453
ah if i were but twenty years old yes said athos doubtless you would commit great follies				202924.9621495405
the count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressing room would be able to defend his property himself				264.232761517291
by men of heart i mean men of courage				1617.8140070166971
private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business be easy on that score m morrel but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor edmond i will let you know that directly i have seen m de villefort whom i shall endeavor to interest in edmond s favor				2461.722625629277
villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger				1783.6358766964095
the door was wide open a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yard a strange sight before so noble a mansion the count looked at it with terror but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his apartment				938.6792544553564
every blow was accompanied with terrible imprecations				160592.85317645714
stop a bit said the dragoon placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney stop a bit i am in it				88.82677608672009
monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you				95.69744105248138
for my part i am going to pay a second visit to this woman who i fear entertains sinister intentions upon her own life and i have received orders to watch her good murmured milady the austere puritan lies as to the soldier he only smiled				559.2722105077514
i beg your pardon sir said the honest fellow in almost breathless haste but i believe you made a mistake you intended to give me a two franc piece and see you gave me a double napoleon thank you my good friend				526.2227798804357
it would be a still worse affair for mazarin whom he execrated for the greater offences he had committed				38349.20727330249
my god can you not remember her name yes it was pronounced in my hearing once				2015.0290693574282
i shall try in the latter case alas				2084.438575038068
i am in a fever said she i have not slept a single instant during all this long night				877.948460269901
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him yes yes cried both young men				602.2576298745589
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret they will not be strangers they will be friends ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp i do and i will tell you why				137174.88411283688
danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered				172475.76428199981
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening				3430.655893193772
anne of austria believed that louis xiii				1413.3774160119858
take twenty five of them aramis and give me the remaining twenty five all right i am glad to see you are of my opinion				9757.42083943799
oh i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother louis xvi than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away by ridicule				9967.885521979733
the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her arm and she slowly withdrew it				88.83414632037056
but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune				4379.464351264776
true he replied and my protector is very kind that dear protector said caderousse and how much does he give you monthly five thousand francs as many thousands as you give me hundreds				141843.1718336269
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated				22081.549466335928
well sir said madame de saint méran after a few minutes reflection i must hasten the marriage for i have but a short time to live you madame you dear mamma exclaimed m de villefort and valentine at the same time				473.8392683482426
the man who abducted my wife the cardinal rang a second time				473.9136098113972
ay that will do at armentières where is that armentières a little town on the lys i shall only have to cross the river and i shall be in a foreign country capital				4405.230008719238
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes				2962.24836621956
athos took the letter from the hands of d artagnan approached the lamp set fire to the paper and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder				217947.05521517317
an event took place in the church of st louis au marais				196039.489679244
saddle our horses take your carbine whom are we going to attack sir no one a mere matter of precaution answered the gascon				1862.9717511648823
it was that of a number of men steadily approaching				2042.218180721849
now monsieur de chavigny piqued himself on his infallible penetration for that which almost proved that he was the son of richelieu was his everlasting pretension he examined attentively the countenance of the applicant for place and fancied that the contracted eyebrows thin lips hooked nose and prominent cheek bones of grimaud were favorable signs				49958.87377481785
three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him				50.33833808735323
i threw the rest away with horror and waited with the dew of fear upon my brow				1392.2866884679704
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none				4342.193318819997
but i am not a foreigner sir said she with an accent as pure as ever was heard between portsmouth and manchester my name is lady clarik and this measure this measure is general madame and you will seek in vain to evade it i will follow you then sir accepting the hand of the officer she began the descent of the ladder at the foot of which the boat waited				7242.446813758184
at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant				1940.1848301900234
although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends				429.7047868213225
the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out and the moment the door closed they have seen each other said he approaching the cardinal eagerly				1947.1656050706786
if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable				184453.6592550221
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united but where is such a lackey to be found not to be found cried athos				152.84505064757755
at the foot of the hill the count dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers				1935.926408911143
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him				50.33842209858862
as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he thought he heard a cry				1705.3561848783986
i only know it says thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s goods nor yet his wife that is a child s reason monsieur blaisois said mousqueton in his most patronizing manner				804.0189825429671
what must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silence the cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance				1144.6746953465756
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the man had become				21079.948839498542
i was waiting for you sir said mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe				15023.09409723778
nevertheless he pressed d artagnan s hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered				258413.80302306093
it is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are answered the wounded man				179.046052833084
when that is over you sir can return to paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her mother in law as you please sir said franz				603.9033988229654
but scarcely had he stepped out of his carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand				231.95772555660656
an intervening elevation of land hid the light				1757.6904490821973
you see it makes a very respectable appearance pardieu cried d artagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinal s money you are an amiable and charming young man said mme				194.5477368320324
it is enough replied the prince				1271.5029955732589
we need no proofs everything relating to this young man is true a dull gloomy silence like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of nature pervaded the assembly who shuddered in dismay				30346.78968357038
captivity the first day chapter liii				42183.92817513356
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair				1469.881815244073
in the excess of his zeal he had accompanied the cart containing the scaffolding as far as the king s window and one of the crossbeams fell on his leg and broke it ah cried aramis that accounts for the cry i heard probably said d artagnan but as he is a thoughtful young man he promised to send four expert workmen in his place to help those already at the scaffold and wrote the moment he was brought home to master tom lowe an assistant carpenter and friend of his to go down to whitehall with three of his friends				429.70458192216194
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression				1763.3905889296311

the man of meung chapter xv				37204.04544603791
if you went to spain would you not see the bull fights				254076.020351838
bonacieux had remained insensible to vulgar seductions but at this period the title of gentleman had great influence with the citizen class and d artagnan was a gentleman				1837.10877268484
he took the key which was customarily given him as one of the family ascended the stairs and introduced mme				194.5533957373204
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips				448.3480550975544
the cardinalists were three the musketeers lackeys included were seven				5023.930567445235
this malady admits but of one remedy i will tell you what that is				2027.4814501857718

bonacieux at home it was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king				425.013192126462
at the end of a year dantès was a new man				179.08891662021222
ah monsieur said the young man i meet you then at last				2114.058667114973
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway				188128.81665534741
the hostess replied only by gasps				214992.91795461313
you must have received a false report or you have gone mad alas sire it is but too true louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance				1217.612386061246
do you think it is worth while said villefort				303.1476701433622
all paris seemed to shout with joy and then the air resounded with the cries of long live broussel long live the coadjutor long live the queen cried de gondy but the cries which replied to his were poor and few and perhaps he had but uttered it to make anne of austria sensible of her weakness				4324.769752438883
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone				1996.9574302271783
adieu perhaps farewell at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw				173691.96287869214
you are come too late you are come to see me die				1384.4034408014215
now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may				117781.68449843963
at a quarter to six o clock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace				957.655057613511
the other was a large square epistle resplendent with the terrible arms of his eminence the cardinal duke				666.1668628779117
as soon as this organization was established they set about driving the english from the isle				159468.37510945278
it must however be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over kitty was to try and find out what had become of mme				194.54810790274615
i shall see you through the window as you mount your horse i shall follow you with my eyes as long as you are in sight then i shall place myself at the cardinal s door a door with glass windows				1467.8884230590886
he determined to cultivate the good will of the youth raoul and either whilst fencing with him or when out shooting to extract from his simplicity some information which would connect the athos of old times with the athos of the present				3211.714434862589
i had at the moment of being ordained a little difficulty with but that would not interest you and i am taking up your valuable time not at all it interests me very much cried d artagnan and at this moment i have absolutely nothing to do yes but i have my breviary to repeat answered aramis then some verses to compose which madame d aiguillon begged of me				126.05719410175836
athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right				1369.6826983019123
ten minutes later the curate of st sulpice was announced				1854.7904439279741
the three lieutenants of the generalissimo				163070.494226067
say on you will permit me to make one remark certainly pray do so then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction				6181.750518400255
they both stood in amazement at the door				212.53841598752743
but since you say nothing remains but for m d épinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to m d épinay for he came this morning to paris valentine uttered a cry				1705.348053125817
the queen was as we have said of great beauty				2084.5906530637944
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover				4692.076187504983
and when did he set out yesterday evening planchet my friend interrupted d artagnan you are really a precious fellow you will understand monsieur i thought there would be still time if you wish to see monsieur de cavois to contradict me by saying you were not yet gone				2979.511320887743
at last his patience was exhausted				2516.818649371384
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased				237910.7945648712
well thought d artagnan poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead and dead by my fault for it was i who dragged him into this affair of which he did not know the origin of which he is ignorant of the result and from which he can derive no advantage without reckoning monsieur added planchet to his master s audibly expressed reflections that we perhaps owe our lives to him				50.3382780794138
no i do not dance but i like to see others do so				430.498068305067
one of them passed around to the right of the carriage the other to the left				1348.234923415534
my fault said he you must be mad				3618.111436732083
aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate				217917.1267969607
his insolent bravery his still more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail had borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called court favor which he had climbed four steps at a time				473.8392683482426
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden				1366.469226368567
we must not do so no you do not sanction our project no there is another way said morrel				434.33466122588806
it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment				217854.78912478205
a dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl				991.2079498757457
the two friends rode rapidly down the declivity of the faubourg but on arriving at the bottom were surprised to find that the streets of paris had become rivers and the open places lakes after the great rains which fell in january the seine had overflowed its banks and the river inundated half the capital				4405.238411036686
your letter has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed julie said madame morrel making a sign to the young man go and tell your father that maximilian has just arrived the young lady rushed out of the apartment but on the first step of the staircase she found a man holding a letter in his hand				231.95319075236537
a nobleman retired from service is he not yes and who had a lackey named grimaud persisted planchet who had prudently considered that he couldn t have too much information				27170.588594981225
this athos then was a very extraordinary man				179.26568864678893
only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis pay and a share in the profits				226424.49585811576
with your permission said danglars bowing i will precede you to show you the way by all means replied monte cristo i follow you chapter 47				217945.80811568777
he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling				19643.670326982356
well inquired the jeweller is the cash all right yes said caderousse				528.78060793248
franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him				50.33867413313605
i guess what brings you here how and why because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same subject by whom by a banker of paris my correspondent whose name is danglars he cried albert yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my father with jealous hatred				3839.072017566275
albert s attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed				194322.92408175065
de winter made a gesture of surprise and the queen turned to him with a start of joy				755.7252751520997
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it				88.88651799746845
the first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour well then said aramis we must form a plan of battle that s very simple replied athos				152.84483200113513
but know you who he was he used to be the headsman of bethune you knew him				50.34157862231472
i have extricated you from misery felton i have caused you to be named lieutenant i once saved your life you know on what occasion				18716.61266345955
she what she asked d artagnan				80.77071301236221
father and son we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow dantès who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small house on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark staircase holding the baluster with one hand while with the other he repressed the beatings of his heart and paused before a half open door from which he could see the whole of a small room				219.26032943629752
but to her great surprise d artagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better when will you do that immediately i hope ah				256.5074642134566
morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob				48200.23625873362
in our position one must provide for everything i shall try to gain the coast of france				587.9698116056505
what papers the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your child s birth the register of my child s birth the register of the birth of andrea cavalcanti of your son is not his name andrea i believe so said the major				3137.001008267638
the glance was of sublime eloquence				197456.11517018007
never mind i ll fix that all right				1369.4071112448632
mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears				33347.041940564966
danglars raving threw himself on the goat skin				201056.8155615531
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became contrary so that we were four or five days without being able to enter the rhône				40324.22636834823
they reached the office of the procurator after having passed through the antechamber in which the clerks were and the study in which they ought to have been				3336.327985841599
where is my son asked villefort let him be removed from the house that he may not see master edward is not downstairs sir replied the valet				7927.296992474386
oh death death said she lowering her voice and her eyelids oh death rather than shame				3060.2526184318394
no i do not jest mordieu i should like to have seen you in my place				1078.9505604695946
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt				1926.7190038940912
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time				473.84084996007334
aramis came behind giving his arm to porthos				145.27495069485977
the moment is at hand he said				497.54513658979386
then d artagnan trod on his foot and porthos began to understand that this was merely acting				31296.009617024716
it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him				50.34081047664595
guiche knew everybody madame de neuillan mademoiselle d aubigne mademoiselle de scudery mademoiselle paulet madame de chevreuse				6392.259805389987
doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character				4363.372379071224
supposing also i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per cent i never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half but to my son in law i would give five and we would share the profits very good father in law said cavalcanti yielding to his low born nature which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it				88.82652195163874
i sank exhausted with fatigue and terror into an armchair				36869.83870471853
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming				4701.204519669247
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring				3455.0412782749954
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet				662.3510661497885
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman				931.7528564755468
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved him i love him				50.346019694224736
he alighted as he saw a species of giant on the steps				1524.071518274233
but if they say it must be to me am i no longer king the queen remained silent				1866.013222351892
she had laid that down the preceding evening				753.4993857118424
the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques				41867.90644993584
d artagnan sprang back the wall had closed again				392.19562152507376
these protestations were nothing for mme				196.08060590682814
then valentine s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds				22958.966857575087
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice				194327.74248181423
zounds he said i don t suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself you are right my lord duke answered the officer i don t know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la ramee				1392.4606395690341
he has he is an abbé ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan				216325.23440298092
monsieur d artagnan is a young man scarcely nineteen or twenty and this gentleman must be thirty at least				2015.8507556736
you would love me then if you were not queen				376.2385805729509
villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy				217904.86564586277
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m de villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden				1366.471181119873
do you think of him yes madame often and often but pazienza as we say in italy next after monsieur de condé comes the duke of orleans what are you saying				11615.5365510756
it was the duc de beaufort who was coming from the vendomois and whom the coadjutor was showing to the parisians intoxicated with joy				755.7130230830701
the sea was calm and with a fresh breeze from the south east they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in turn his beacon lights each of which is a world				822.1784423775453
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair				1143.3540192813857
enough enough replied caderousse say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon myself and he began his story				2663.1837995069914
the english do they dislike wine they hate it but i have seen them drink it as a punishment				4619.931453656024
the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself				1888.6656087901092
this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m de boville the inspector of prisons no				412.6907001769901
he shall not come in before i am gone said he and when i am gone you can open to him but i ought to be gone too				2060.12073016672
well then we will go into paris				459.2033942060551
how ghastly pale he is oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz				603.9195249987814
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear				4814.554166976327
this then continued aramis was my first opinion but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquired eh my friend aramis paused				2619.0060528615363
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done				879.362502556651
to present our respects to the cardinal porthos swallowed the second glass with the same grace with which he had imbibed the first took his beaver and followed d artagnan				80.11406741332308
egad cried d artagnan it s quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here the devil said porthos in that case they have eaten everything bah said d artagnan they will have left a chicken at least he dismounted and knocked on the door				212.2451199068282
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master				1849.2498032928888
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that d artagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queen s letter and for which he had repaid m de wardes with such terrible coin				161756.41852058758
being naturally goodhearted and having had once a liking for athos which had grown into a sincere friendship he was delighted at thus meeting a man full of intelligence and moral strength instead of a drunkard				217947.05521517317
you could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself you who pursue crime so vindictively answer now why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling the baroness became pale				675.799100663306
henceforth valentine you will never again be separated on earth since he has rushed into death to find you				95.69958578501888
bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent				43907.03454165414
then wishing to make the best use of his time while he had the means of labor he continued to work without ceasing				227677.35049926562
he did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the prisoners look upon with utter despair				1469.8888242034604
no replied mousqueton parry kept it				89.5305396326569
and your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them				157.7132668954599
and besides he considered it most expedient without exhibiting too much ill will to follow to the end his role as confessor				16023.204196534349
and as for your poor arm what difference will that make				5153.384991347063
no said caderousse we are not rich enough to lose 5 000 francs as you please my dear sir said the jeweller i had however as you see brought you the money in bright coin and he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of bank notes				16993.51763102739
when landing at portsmouth milady was an englishwoman whom the persecutions of the french drove from la rochelle when landing at boulogne after a two days passage she passed for a frenchwoman whom the english persecuted at portsmouth out of their hatred for france				587.9633632263674
i have done all in my power to ameliorate them and yet the belief of the public you say is that they proceed from me an unhappy foreigner who has been unable to please the french				1514.593976089784
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head				426.9310416354634
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon				2109.2586942962957
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near				4310.707762822269
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man				179.04255245904898
as to groslow he promised himself that on the following evening he would recover from d artagnan what he had lost to porthos and on leaving reminded the gascon of his appointment				63955.55819675457
give these happy tidings to your sister my dear cousin				36737.41155799693
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five o clock our little cabin boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom house officers advancing in our direction				4026.4911633845586
the night passed in perfect silence				716.2279278099357
let us see i have told you				95.99524219402244
he would have been discovered by the beating of his heart if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment				574.1025268973161
because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead				2464.6519261005806
what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede it is not for me to say you are wrong you must advise me what to do do you seriously ask my advice valentine certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it you know my devotion to you valentine said morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain				2187.553080282185
i will send for m deschamps we will read and sign the contract before we separate and this evening madame de villefort shall accompany valentine to her estate where we will rejoin them in a week sir said franz i have one request to make what is it i wish albert de morcerf and raoul de château renaud to be present at this signature you know they are my witnesses half an hour will suffice to apprise them will you go for them yourself or shall you send i prefer going sir i shall expect you then in half an hour baron and valentine will be ready franz bowed and left the room				219.26032943629752
athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria				3161.0681625098982
oh it would be a sacrilege				260467.89033559788
he thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom faria offered the treasures				41448.61630887889
he fixed his eyes upon d artagnan even more earnestly than before				775.2727721461202
and am i not a hundred times better thus cried eugénie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so oh you are beautiful always beautiful cried louise				28566.02992514033

he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep				1402.5663447147222
upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador				251360.3363849065
the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back				804.3242158237522
but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster				217944.14532747428
my friends will be there i hope that is to say you are invited m danglars and you caderousse and fernand said caderousse with a chuckle fernand too is invited my wife s brother is my brother said edmond and we mercédès and i should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time fernand opened his mouth to reply but his voice died on his lips and he could not utter a word				527.2573456253132
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees				1349.1146818043146
in the centre of this court in the form of a horseshoe were the buildings occupied by mazarin and at each wing the pavilion or smaller building where d artagnan was confined and that level with the orangery where athos was to be				833.5563714290229
i must reach compiègne tonight or i shall cause deep anxiety to my family				1594.9406865198214
do you mean at rome i do ah then i suppose you heard haydée s guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land morcerf did not pursue the subject and monte cristo himself fell into a silent reverie				3709.7560167900574
cæsar proposed to his father that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake hands with them but alexander vi				14593.440236139979

andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle				52796.13105458982
the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty				1937.7347251298754

sire said athos we foresaw this and if lord winter s men but do their duty we are saved instead of lost at this moment they heard above all the galloping and neighing of the horses winter s voice crying out sword in hand at these words every sword was drawn and glittered in the air like lightning				2496.1301985805453
they will be paid if there is no way of getting out of it does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the cabals of that day by bacchus rejoined mazarin impatiently it s about an hour since i asked you for that very thing wooden head that you are there is one man for whom i can answer if he will speak out that s my concern i will make him speak ah my lord tis not easy to make people say what they don t wish to let out pooh				5888.443805629123
this is the last judge that is all				336.04561642232846
thanks thanks but fortunately i do not want for anything and it chances that at times there are others who have need of me dantès made a gesture				3262.6276008293758
well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu admirable sire but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety my dear duke when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours and that without getting in the least out of breath ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young man who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful information				27170.666330769942
there are ten men to accompany you				96.00087257324856
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity				28968.18500065849
i have already had the honor of telling you i was said morrel				434.3574435829864
what interest have they in your death				781.8963470476327
someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was here that who was here your child your son your andrea i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness				7421.744797888847
de monte cristo receives my apology				191172.71030712916
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubted the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death				781.2255279552935
to morrow night we shall rescue you how can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy				755.7108609738609
again the abbé looked at him then mournfully shook his head but in accordance with dantès request he began to speak of other matters				6640.410544293702
d artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment				938.8189151542083
they heard the guard going its rounds				151620.11304971433
the young man was overwhelmed as he read				8700.306956927985
her beautiful face was distorted with agony her glassy eyes had no longer their sight a convulsive shuddering shook her whole body the sweat rolled from her brow				1392.3079332389484
adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps				1524.0780588936527
my dear d herblay who can say whether d artagnan may not have betrayed us to the cardinal				410.11731485537183
raoul without dismounting called to the host and announced that a wounded man was about to be brought to his house and begged him in the meantime to prepare everything needful				169195.6015045668
because he had no cash to save				176105.3007302894
hold your tongue said he and let me answer				803.7104159369499
this second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the ground where he was writhing in agony				11918.602272716253
this is modesty indeed cried d artagnan				80.3771327545556
from this phrase d artagnan awakened planchet the reader must not suppose it was night or that day was hardly come				1006.5263126099585
i think him capable of everything well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest i beg pardon interrupted beauchamp are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us yes and for a most curious one go on then for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning and i must make up for it i was at rome during the last carnival we know that said beauchamp				761.1536502709049
this island was always had been and still is completely deserted				11150.935971985438
well well said m morrel i know there was no one in fault but destiny				9221.741586694938
as long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land he kept his face toward milady who standing on the deck followed him with her eyes				492.36470079616873
will your excellency visit saint peter s asked the cicerone				37309.21622435134
have you the money he demands yes all but eight hundred piastres the count went to his secrétaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz				603.9025349328417
silence said felton i hear footsteps we are discovered there was a silence of several seconds				22958.988752962552
where does he live rue férou two steps from here let us go both resumed their way				676.9414608570157
however in an hour i shall know all				336.06276243666656
a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and danglars sighed as m cavalcanti had done half an hour before				775.2139954346736
the damp had rendered it friable and dantès was able to break it off in small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed				7184.687731688398
i have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping albert on the steps				1524.0707915404746
but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice				2336.3625130122537
then let us sit down said villefort impatiently for it will take some time sit down said the old man				179.04536982789855
i descended the staircase step by step the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees				1349.1204715888368
0057m danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards fernand said well you understand there is no need to kill him certainly not if as you said just now you have the means of having dantès arrested				8040.945388687171
but and i say it with some pride mercédès god needed me and i lived				12735.023646218442
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed				10226.820534549708
bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce d artagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to aramis on leaving athos				152.84505064757755
d artagnan suggested that he should send word to his wife so that she might not be anxious about him but planchet replied with much sagacity that he was very sure his wife would not die of anxiety through not knowing where he was while he planchet remembering her incontinence of tongue would die of anxiety if she did know				1128.7066145114889
fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person				1123.761647614225
julie emmanuel and some of the servants ran up in alarm on hearing the cries of maximilian				1093.2097565253027
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do				915.9917189803039
if we are not we shall have all the time to talk and nobody will hear us for i guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears if we are we will talk of our affairs just the same				1670.9718762065154
here i await thee there was profound silence				714.2941016099386
yes that is the very boy he s patronized by bazin ah yes i know of what importance is this little reptile to you asked porthos				145.03975335376717
long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day				483.11763823855716
you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i can not remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all no monsieur i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbé busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but i pray you go away from that plane tree				13536.389596897321
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole monsieur d artagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment				893.6718330654917
he did not look like an executioner and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way				676.9279037773875
the latter retained the count s hand between his				1113.4464532770653
at the royal arms of england you will find a young gentleman named mordaunt yes my lord and what am i to do with this young gentleman follow wherever he leads you d artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air				1218.728235080765
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge				30422.99992626497
but i am eager to see our young vicomte				34491.63200467792
do you think i ever sleep then				889.6454235055929
to london cried porthos and what the devil are we going to do in london that is what i am not at liberty to tell you gentlemen you must trust to me but in order to go to london added porthos money is needed and i have none nor i said aramis				151.46885407360074
do you know that i die to morrow at ten o clock something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible the king looked at aramis with astonishment				893.6658671822836
what does all this mean asked aramis				151.93963083063198
it must be it shall be seizing a pen he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no other than his will made since his arrival in paris a sort of codicil clearly explaining the nature of his death				781.2255279552935
sir said aramis you allowed yourself just now to treat us in a most extraordinary manner				804.0396856603564
taste the hashish guest of mine taste the hashish franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth				2594.6081853571654
he is some spanish or flemish spy said he putting his hand to his pistol				13568.468447765843
the woman whom you and your masters commanded me to kill milady yes milady it is true you called her thus what has the monk to do with this milady she was his mother grimaud trembled and stared at the dying man in a dull and leaden manner				804.0185991569318
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden				1366.4809549183485
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of us i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter				673.7559326159014
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared				585.3380372446086
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence				3255.4479836577207
you are the son of the marchese cavalcanti and the marchesa oliva corsinari				36039.56035414932
this tranquillity proved one thing that d artagnan did not yet know milady				406.6198747565513
i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment have you no friends who could assist you morrel smiled mournfully				202014.92868864074
that is to say athos will be chief engineer porthos purveyor in general and aramis governor of the fortress meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau				4708.365503163614
buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him and which at the end of half an hour was transformed into a workshop				195735.7318293009
you have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels always followed by such happy results alas dear friend said aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military life				469.16867536439395
have a care cried porthos to his opponent i ve still two pistols charged the more reason you should fire the first cried his foe				199146.7930619451
i will not abandon buckingham thus				1454.1509187524223
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses i have no horse said d artagnan but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de tréville s that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine one of yours				2984.9975872332193
could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the camp				2462.389457515122
you will receive for them fifty or sixty thousand francs spend them if necessary but let these gentlemen be treated as they deserve that is to say like kings the queen had two letters ready one written by herself the other by her daughter the princess henrietta				21013.451361559066
d artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him alone and in a few minutes cahusac fell with a sword thrust through his throat				1631.3005735535974
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof				17838.05192033422
bring your comrades here one and all but let everything remain as usual only close the shutters of the ground floor and those of the first floor you know they are never closed				2292.798319500399
no doubt my boy no doubt				6723.646790237818
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness				7421.75895375714
arrived at the staircase it was still worse				7633.486665019747
the count cried a young voice that made athos start				5057.036116290076
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree 30069m well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on				528.3355121650363
why not because he is an actor in the drama has he assassinated anyone then no on the contrary they wished to assassinate him				50.33886616030489
it was to this effect tears entreaties prayers have availed me nothing				712.5316208007362
a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity it is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation to whom does this island belong to tuscany what game shall i find there thousands of wild goats who live upon the stones i suppose said franz with an incredulous smile				397.4944035188306
tell me valentine for it is that i came to know valentine trembled and looked at him with amazement				1848.4933813434632
now let us go 50205m these words had scarcely escaped him when the carriage was on its way and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement				74103.90117516137
ah monsieur cried planchet as soon as he perceived his master here is more trouble				10857.404179223453
i humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lose but if i accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place he will have had the glory of having saved his king cried winter				673.7552900724794
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme				194.5601680862384
because she had been branded continued d artagnan				80.24742464144647
the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his side not from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation he fought like a furious tiger turning ten times round his adversary and changing his ground and his guard twenty times				5614.05741550245

the people were shouting and running about with torches				14289.207178344706
you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me 50155m well be it so				430.4707672665413
die cried mademoiselle paulet bitterly he				210.10464271719476
in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the other an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of valentine s mind				473.3088226215906
it is true that since i left him i seem to have lost my senses				4180.046062379148
at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed				17758.783966074014
come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m noirtier de villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being not of providence but of fate				9228.216638906957
from the time of his arrival in paris he had been mixed up with public affairs but his own private affairs had made no great progress either in love or fortune				1182.1785572059587
what did he say some parting words to his friends his friends murmured cromwell				1618.4220110984877
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return from italy her ladyship is waiting to receive you gentlemen said the servant who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress				1104.7736422486303
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir				538.7809161899185
but the count disregarding his cry continued to wring the bandit s wrist until his arm being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the floor				1564.4139672814288
aramis returned home and athos and d artagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire				45446.22899391258
what is there then behind this wall				856.33259307833
oh you are a man of god sir cried caderousse for no one knew that edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept it which said the abbé to himself you would have done the abbé rose took his hat and gloves				10364.071346417628
raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell				4021.276036348694

it is not just that he should despise me so without any reason				3544.907567229219
he proposed to fernand to accompany him fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general				2605.550772068789
instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a letter				592.0198433552512
master friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket				217946.63951455182
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor				3972.8616622122913
excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth				2400.2497089882254
but you my dear d artagnan what can you expect my dear porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said d artagnan				80.11452583100548
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life andrea visibly changed countenance				1217.6129666642146
remain sir he added to aramis who had moved to leave the room				219.29378846011994
that french officer yes fernand yes the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand				231.95330135629206
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood				4338.658311875898
what has become of him i shouldn t wonder if he were at the head of the mob at this very moment				574.1025268973161
aramis cried athos i am arrested good replied aramis calmly				18222.500613460812
he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover patch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty				3157.2991097564245
but à propos resumed m de tréville what has become of your three companions i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them none monsieur well i left them on my road porthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining see there now said m de tréville and how the devil did you escape by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry there again				391.9701481468536

for a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands and during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks				1540.7806744827194
there on a table surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco known from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakia was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond beside them in boxes of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouth pieces ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers				28285.320207170862

if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed a being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain yes i know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant i will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death				781.2255279552935

the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women				2058.671303327252
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all how in the wrong said athos				152.84483200113513
that is my answer the answer was terrible				6459.596318370135

why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardes he whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governor s country house so it is said d artagnan i know him now				1201.9317043121114
but i am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir				538.6743087725972
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead				624.8621056384229
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldn t surprise me at all perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us nonsense				5362.936304103118
but tell me count will your people take care of my horse do not alarm yourself my dear maximilian they understand i mean because he wants petting				217946.22381472334

one believes readily what he wishes to believe				3655.8239107842433
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other				472.0067985217686
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word				527.2591055395106

porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them aramis had eight of them				157.7077019312392
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the count				288.84445045090274
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given				3037.4048856847353
not so foolish as all that ah muttered athos i may be mistaken i haven t the unerring eye of d artagnan who is speaking of monsieur d artagnan asked an officer who appeared at that moment upon the threshold of the room				219.26032943629752

what do you think of that exploit my lord it is magnificent said mazarin thoughtfully				210744.92145238488
it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmond s admiration of him but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there				485.7512209876534

the night was cold and still the family had all retired to rest but villefort who alone remained up and worked till five o clock in the morning reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the examining magistrates compiling the depositions of the witnesses and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation which was one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered				184644.97117487717

peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl				14200.402943745192
the man took his way toward the city				1258.7766103490076
oh if so punish me as you will but do not do not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and constrained haydée replied the count you know that you are now in france and are free free to do what asked the young girl				991.2065319424139
she heard him enter but she did not raise her head				426.97440565011647

all right and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise				5725.303459992441
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos				152.8488405689429
i will tell it cried milady with a feigned exultation on the day when i shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith the look of felton revealed to milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word				527.2573456253132
then we are once more reunited said andrea				3039.3144076852973

ah traitor cried buckingham you have killed me murder screamed patrick				9529.063713558628

this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall				1751.116730401539
i once endeavored to go down with two of my servants but he flew into terrible rage				1562.7960480443435
i did not lose sight of him for an instant				1197.1356397251643
at ten o clock in the evening it is well known the streets in provincial towns are very little frequented				216501.4896300185
ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me i wish my lord would make me one promise what				670.0212556939267

everything was ready at ten o clock for the departure and as athos was watching raoul mount a groom rode up from the duchess de chevreuse				6392.6987421075255
it is true we plundered them a little when we took them and i will even confess that it is their purse that monsieur du vallon and i draw on in our nightly play				5690.465406320462
the four lackeys guarded the door and the window				533.6012199291015
monsieur d artagnan said the commissary addressing athos declare all that passed yesterday between you and monsieur but cried bonacieux this is not monsieur d artagnan whom you show me what				670.015824368405
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydée s countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request oh it is nothing said monte cristo				202.1432592490653
bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already full				16636.631482076864
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid her monte cristo started				3111.926790847054

i do not recollect it said haydée				3111.7012489069302
besides the provident law has deprived you of the power to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the power to compel me to marry monsieur this or monsieur that				539.1764469639019
you are insane monsieur monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting and d artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to d artagnan to serve him as a safeguard				225915.2463234667
but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this since 1811 dantès shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in prison				867.8234973484629
your turn my lord said athos				153.5107444843414
with one word you have crushed it and i die but the duel will not take place edmond since you forgive it will take place said monte cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your son s blood to stain the ground mine will flow mercédès shrieked and sprang towards monte cristo but suddenly stopping edmond said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again i trust to him from my heart				360.6754609213533
you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient				11293.639954636366
then rising in despair he exclaimed the chief the chief here i am said vampa instantly appearing what do you want take my last gold muttered danglars holding out his pocket book and let me live here i ask no more for liberty i only ask to live then you suffer a great deal oh yes yes cruelly still there have been men who suffered more than you i do not think so yes those who have died of hunger danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed				692.0271353944912
a black satin stock fresh from the maker s hands gray moustaches a bold eye a major s uniform ornamented with three medals and five crosses in fact the thorough bearing of an old soldier such was the appearance of major bartolomeo cavalcanti that tender father with whom we are already acquainted				9718.861203614631
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners				8577.650180220597
i do not jest said athos				153.51535613012032
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for d artagnan to follow him				50.338602123136596
believe me there are only the two plans i have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer				152445.97410965568

no no i am aware you know me but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery				220509.8372074405
which of you gentlemen asked the magistrate without replying to the count answers to the name of andrea cavalcanti a cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room				219.26074764258593
well i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year 1640 and related to the true cardinal				410.1122303483416
let us alight here said athos				153.556427847808
aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs and then immediately came up again to d artagnan whose senses were still in a state of confusion				10554.936918043417
valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event				11204.715595299382
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride				3792.9164079074476
the musketeer met with a superb andalusian horse black as jet nostrils of fire legs clean and elegant rising six years				880.6939888251227

my first impulse on coming to myself was to feel under my pillow for the knife i had not been able to reach if it had not been useful for defense it might at least serve for expiation				34074.0933359674
the servants standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at noirtier s old servant who had heard the noise from his master s room and run there also remaining behind the others				1416.834962487623
as ten o clock was striking d artagnan left m de tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon but at the foot of the stairs d artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane				22437.71260719517
have you really met with some great misfortune oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which i have sustained nothing worth mentioning i assure you true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all 900 000 francs are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood 30183m what do you say said the count 900 000 francs				741.7262047910266
all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you				95.69703036450007
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth				260994.7853979676
meanwhile to his great regret as he said he was obliged to keep his bed				692.0456147593641
d artagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient				23165.22265881598
i have not seen you nor your friends and i don t think you could gather all that dust that i saw planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris you are right my dear monsieur bonacieux my friends and i have been on a little journey far from here oh lord no				412.6891258899073
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another				581.1502375576704
all that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and disdainful words i poured out upon this man				179.04468682531856
the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head				426.9290058744706
on entering the court of his hôtel buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestibule				45120.137381463224
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs what say you duke i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these never ending labors				55817.778977263464
0255m the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old man s limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open				1289.5502803383295
this is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed				199102.3564638338
from that moment the old man s eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it				88.83096942053709
the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nîmes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the child he might become acquainted with your person nay he might even then have known it				88.82652195163874
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precaution s sake				35996.21150146326
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock				35752.89214789472
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo				202.1432592490653
perhaps not so great as you think porthos you know the proverb all roads lead to rome but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked porthos				145.03885427208422

ah thought the gascon he looks displeased				236881.81382021762
have you by any chance been in the bastile no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it ah				256.5088096521784
what is to be done asked d artagnan				80.23988679957077
your wit is always leading you beyond bounds if monsieur de tréville heard you you would repent of speaking thus are you going to give me a lesson porthos cried aramis from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning				2496.1313888284594
precisely madame replied monte cristo but i perceive i have not much to teach you				95.704970644498
then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it				88.88550077781757
you furnished a principal of 100 000 francs				743.7062825626325
truly she might have thought of you at home i have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her touching sympathy				13627.953783037417
i have however already told you sir i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said villefort				302.98538162043553
in addition to this d artagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart endure nothing from anyone but the king the cardinal and monsieur de tréville he flew then rather than walked toward the convent of the carmes déchaussés or rather deschaux as it was called at that period a sort of building without a window surrounded by barren fields an accessory to the preaux clercs and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose				2220.23648877166
near paris is it not very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil at auteuil said villefort true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken				1648.7159256635825
d artagnan s intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged not only to stop but to enter into conversation with him				50.33831408416887
the injured husband goes through all the emotions of jealousy until conviction seizes on his mind and then in a frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance				1144.674149523277
not with us sir replied dantès				542.0194650738097
now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire d angoisse				213079.9083962872
sir he cried scarcely able to believe his good fortune sir i can not understand your generosity oh it is very simple my good fellow i have been a sailor and your story touched me more than it would others then sir since you are so liberal i ought to offer you something 50227m what have you to offer to me my friend				526.2227798804357

it is i mousqueton said a mournful voice whilst a sort of shadow arose out of the side of the road				2062.9429657562823
the only thing that was pleasant to him in that odious tableau such is the instability of the human mind was the sullen face of grimaud for whom he had at first conceived such a hatred and who now was all his hope				1245.451672682219
porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the rue du vieux colombier				176870.61434171675
the king s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of athos s heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom				9775.37815767563
porthos gained fifty pistoles from groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be				833.5639234056086
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which to day we are trying to perform for charles i but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years well in spite of that d artagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her no indeed said d artagnan i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance you see then d artagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is athos said d artagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven so then said athos offering his hand to d artagnan				80.11383820546554
alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore				217947.05521517317

my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes and will you go asked kitty				2956.474010264326
the tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the palais royal entirely				35426.82196789333
i take them said d artagnan for myself				768.0472696003504
d artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry				140343.94845290037
but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which spada had written i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle the heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that spada the rich man was really the most miserable of uncles no treasures unless they were those of science contained in the library and laboratories				217947.26306578118

what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go why i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily bravo porthos				145.03871595231996
charles also had recognized the four frenchmen				25038.263573032233
hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly d artagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos				145.03864679248733
come come gentlemen remove the fellow and d artagnan pushed the half stupefied mercer among the guards saying to him you are a shabby old fellow my dear				17419.982224187712
the door soon opened and the accused appeared				1103.5795121936505
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the château d if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed				31183.334606492066
if he were rich if he had cavalcanti s fortune that might be pardoned				39222.108126126695
what do you say of him				50.75777943987242
is the committee willing to hear this witness yes yes they all said at once				2015.0213826462084
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinal s cap then he added so my friend it s your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape that s my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it				88.82656430743515

the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly 30293m then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbé busoni				6772.679027290779
it was as a prey to this hallucination that d artagnan traveled at whatever pace his horse pleased the six or eight leagues that separated chantilly from crèvecœur without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road				2062.9498515828036
ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor				12518.695990389426
no distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage				7243.165170675158
he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by				20385.95984167331
accordingly it was admitted to the presence of anne who silent and lofty as ever listened to the speeches and complaints of the deputies but when they had finished their harangues not one of them could say so calm remained her face whether or no she had heard them				157.7055211204376
in this case however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar				217934.58454143172
doubtless there was a strange expression in his eyes for the jailer said come are you going mad again dantès did not answer he feared that the emotion of his voice would betray him				50.33836209054904
this was all that m de tréville wanted				2981.7654694995117
dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone				858.361540673472
are you sure that the other is dead the other said athos in so stifled a voice that d artagnan scarcely heard him				50.33904618644095

dantès went on looking from time to time behind and around about him				50.34918869854666
who are you sir asked she who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my account you may perceive madame by my uniform that i am an officer in the english navy replied the young man				179.04255245904898
ah cried d artagnan really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart ah that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me and i have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that i pant to make a reality of it well merit this pretended happiness then i am at your orders said d artagnan				80.11383820546554
yes i hope so at least				2019.0994529330521
milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain on her lips but rage in her heart				360.67993251907944

i made inquiries and found that the house in the champs élysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up				1256.5091798059532
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him				50.3551551305011

and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on you on them depended my father s life replied she				716.1439178112283
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret				15023.137078716245
the king signed the order for release and tréville carried it away without delay				10782.141057375931
pardieu said athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovels				235676.73301056327

i was so delighted to see her again				392.3295460127839
at five in the evening they sent mousqueton on before as agreed upon				2794.2977812741765
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole				6835.908168255293
you are there sir he said respectfully				23308.266857556144
messieurs musketeers i will not have this haunting of bad places this quarreling in the streets this swordplay at the crossways and above all i will not have occasion given for the cardinal s guards who are brave quiet skillful men who never put themselves in a position to be arrested and who besides never allow themselves to be arrested to laugh at you				95.69693910074358
the circumstances that had hastened the return of d artagnan to paris were as follows one evening when mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolf like step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink				217947.4709165874

some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minute s air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice will there be another funeral today at the procureur s house madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell				6728.573140089735

on descending we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view				4831.218003363335
30301m meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery of curious glances towards madame de morcerf who standing before a mantle piece ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a looking glass placed opposite the door and was prepared to receive him				50.33829008099596
i am suffering i can not see				1795.0622689428596
have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed				44552.98325419543

a young and beautiful girl with hair as black as jet her eyes as velvety as the gazelle s was leaning with her back against the wainscot rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor her arms bare to the elbow brown and modelled after those of the arlesian venus moved with a kind of restless impatience and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her well turned leg in its red cotton gray and blue clocked stocking				179132.23493644258

de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection				217940.1962563102
athos rose walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step embraced him tenderly and as he burst into violent sobs he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice friend be a man				179.04263783321124
if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again				391.97911973423896
to say that i shall live here like the mercédès of other times gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe me				126.0576749727092
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you				95.69693910074358
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled				144055.71835022437
yes but in order to avenge herself she must be free				5892.235594836922
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars				12287.186098404745
if she flies kill her but don t exceed your orders an expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of milady but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning				2496.1290083331987
i serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but i serve the one with joy and the other against my will				1730.4358587943545
that is forbidden it seems to me where forbidden asked mousqueton				1067.1266211992056
oh no said kitty it is not me you love				978.3412502074756
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance				1145.4827991347513
your husband then is at last dead how does that concern you replied the swiss				3573.054765879133
i fear an attack myself after all these disasters oh man murmured d avrigny the most selfish of all animals the most personal of all creatures who believes the earth turns the sun shines and death strikes for him alone an ant cursing god from the top of a blade of grass				184593.38367084033
courage he whispered to porthos as they proceeded				12576.565171003196
aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent				6507.770360602332
penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his master s daughter mademoiselle julie and had never been able to change the name to madame herbault				203204.79756915764
god save the king was the cry in every direction the young monarch gravely put his head out of the window looked sufficiently grateful and even bowed at which the cries of the multitude were renewed				212492.83546737148
exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello				9608.95893091752
i thought the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a treasure had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but i could find nothing				712.482357078624
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him				50.33832608575962
when he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence				31886.37501549006
and now gentlemen i wish you good morning said monte cristo				202.21026099571935
arriving before the inn at which his master and himself had made such an enormous repast he approached athos and said showing him the airhole of the cellar sausages athos began to laugh for this juvenile escapade of his appeared to be as amusing as if some one had related it of another person				1123.761647614225
d artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself				264.27560362977414
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d armilly of whom he had heard much				1265.5280480454157
the storm of last night overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these rocks where do you come from from these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost				1014.4607453301521
this clever person is your relative then cousin german go on to your cousin then aramis continued my dear cousin his eminence the cardinal whom god preserve for the happiness of france and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom is on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of la rochelle				7012.387199370376
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris				458.21692206865623
then they began to pass around the dusky piquant arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north				193691.4524964301
if we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be grand so you know beforehand you must perish said d artagnan				80.11399101063104
what is offered from a generous heart should be accepted generously				188565.11748469563
he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept				11846.496455312454
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications				217947.4709165874
you didn t know king charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side				823.4873460508468
and you you d artagnan a man sprung from the ancient nobility of france bearing an honorable name carrying a good sword have helped to give up a king to beersellers shopkeepers and wagoners				217947.05521517317
and now said athos what is to be done				879.6564899028788
smiled as she advanced to meet a man she hated and despised				12560.431675143554
the young man was opening the door of the stable				7943.279928916916
several strokes resounded on the door this time milady really pushed him away from her				164.28638212298276
at this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door				212.290768883418
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming laporte with questions who replied only in these words sire it is by the queen s commands the bedclothes were thrown back exposing the king s bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen				3037.123919262817
a part of the good abbé s words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home				1608.5510206158544
were consumed or nearly so he commenced complaints which athos thought nauseous porthos indecent and aramis ridiculous				22584.749037319136
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects				57900.54998976166
the road which the carriage now traversed was the ancient appian way and bordered with tombs				148987.72312539702
they must die die all together killed at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of god s				837.5090197892331
but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized captain groslow				1420.6376014316243
it is when one is lowest on the wheel of fortune that the merry go round wheels and rewards us				454.0383679959791
these words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape albert he felt his heart beat and taking his mother s hand within his own he said tenderly yes you will live i shall live then you will not leave me albert mother i must go said albert in a firm calm voice you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you besides i have signed 50145m you will obey your own wish and the will of heaven not my own wish mother but reason necessity				14461.049839265042
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last				2114.1786298640263
he carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in england the ambassadors of denmark who had taken their leave and the regular ambassador of holland who was to take back to the port of flushing the indian merchantmen of which charles i had made restitution to the united provinces				157211.94640963615
milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king				425.02312268452926
now retire to your chambers said athos and leave me to act				2233.837697663398
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul				9307.976989581524
u s laws alone swamp our small staff				26191.822288865642
he was a simple looking lawyer s clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener				217935.00021906
and how do you know it asked milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart				360.6768367916721
i called to you but you did not answer me i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours				2985.00043395011
he arose bowed went out returned by the same way he came re entered the hôtel and went to his apartment				938.6801496500796
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden				1366.4809549183485
aha he cried with a smile of satisfaction				6174.774331710829
what was most pressing was to get mme				194.8195500412726
i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher and what did he do the rest of his time monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory which as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholics all in the name of religion he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic sometimes a huguenot				55712.797891620605
go into the grotto and dress yourself at these words he drew away the stone and showed teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror on a rustic table made by luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume				3046.996471905243
but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of milady was increased by his not having killed her brother in law				2552.1155588227757
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him				50.33833808735323
i am not begging my fine fellow said the unknown to the servant with so ironical an expression of the eye and so frightful a smile that he withdrew i only wish to say two or three words to your master who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago come said andrea with sufficient nerve for his servant not to perceive his agitation what do you want				6960.676853600865
what man is that cried milady suffocated by terror her hair loosening itself and rising above her livid countenance as if alive				8044.274181828509
he found the count standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling				36985.491125197834
whatever you say sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house and do not do such things no the commission i ask is quite different name it sir i beg you are the inspector of prisons i have been so these fourteen years you keep the registers of entries and departures i do to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners there are special reports on every prisoner well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared suddenly				11557.800899275033
the other room near the library was a bedroom				2518.8272389071685
the contract three days after the scene we have just described namely towards five o clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of the contract between mademoiselle eugénie danglars and andrea cavalcanti whom the banker persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the count of monte cristo s house and the count was preparing to go out				528.1138602690124
one night more and he would be on his way				677.0880237631897
then came the question of gallantry and love affairs				3696.4209347606743
don t let us disarrange your eminence				1736.0360234556465
forward cried d artagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh over all this in five minutes and they darted on anew				243230.04514632255
she could read to the depths of the heart of this young man the death of buckingham was written there at full length				10692.950112417584
peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly				7267.811953938004
i shall be with mine under the third				18839.875249154735
oh yes she cried i do love you				95.83950785039688
that it seems is where he meditates on state affairs in that case said d artagnan i begin to believe that monsieur de la fere will receive the visit of his eminence he will of course have an escort yes two soldiers and will he talk thus of affairs in presence of two strangers the soldiers are swiss who understand only german				143237.8767585063
he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du musée but strange to say he was not there when i returned monsieur morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs monsieur morrel it is his voice said julie				2956.4599127312836
well continued the count in a tone that made franz shudder this young gentleman is one of my friends this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself this young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger why did you not tell me all this you inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his look				945.3816666827512
for pity s sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressing for pity s sake do not call assistance				3670.3739166173373
of monsieur de bouillon my friend i think that he is much troubled with gout you noticed that i didn t breathe a word as to the purpose of our visit you did well you would have caused him an access of his disease				196432.1198567973
you pledge yourself to that marshal added gondy turning to la meilleraie				31675.850644818827
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors				36071.88264260407
a secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by lackeys porthos s plan appears to me to be impracticable said d artagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you				95.69693910074358
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables that is to say athos porthos and aramis				151.46885407360074
now shall i tell you something added athos coolly				6725.134578087589
now as d artagnan had been the hero of these two fights it was upon him that all the felicitations fell which athos porthos and aramis abandoned to him not only as good comrades but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his				1112.6996815852035
now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it thank you my friend thank you unfortunately i have just breakfasted well said porthos arrange the table mousqueton and while we breakfast d artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us willingly said d artagnan				80.11383820546554
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental d artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance				1217.6129666642146
this portrait attracted the count of monte cristo s attention for he made three rapid steps in the chamber and stopped suddenly before it				88.82758085260778
we will not constrain you to help us we enroll no one against his conscience but we will compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what i should call becoming your accomplice				194342.38373812605
her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor her beauty serves as a bait to her victims her body even pays what she promises i must do her that justice				2336.3625130122537
is the abbé at home asked he				209.2280482503475
40044m general d épinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell				4021.2606964272522
that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvre all which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham				1341.802146872704
i expected as i told you to reach the outer wall pierce through it and throw myself into the sea i have however kept along the corridor on which your chamber opens instead of going beneath it				88.82660666325174
yes especially if you will show me the poor abbé s room ah				256.5379217818548
they all alighted and hastened to pay their respects to the king and queen in their coach				8381.234805039086
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their masters				5029.313960029677
the ever new passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those clouds which float in the heavens reflecting sometimes azure sometimes fire sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest and which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and death				781.2255279552935
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no				412.6891258899073
dantès followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve				124103.4029496932
albert however felt no less insulted the few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult				13466.511772775468
whether he heard mordaunt or not as he entered cromwell did not move				6462.911437646288
she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object				9303.814711328825
d artagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them				157.72334449258008
you wish to know what i will do yes i will find him as i told you				95.70127422529889
de wardes one of the cardinal s men a cousin of rochefort				2042.6194280061143
shows how with threat and pen more is effected than by the sword				947.8330969163918
it would be no doubt parbleu if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast importance of the horrors of the cardinal speak lower said athos				152.84534217665396
aramis had passed his sword through the body of the first and athos had knocked down the other with the butt end of his pistol				13569.244863971373
my fair friend said athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war				2242.937881153289
i do not understand my lord said she in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out				528.1251924846487
what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall				57492.27667382864
gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances gentlemen m noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m franz de quesnel baron d épinay he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect				246376.61137730195
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence				2212.2355881104586
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets				37504.95999887216
while he was doing this d artagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared				585.3338505956872
the ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage and everyone reconducted his lady to her place but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady to advance eagerly toward the queen				376.1481715512764
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor				2461.739059455626
how mousqueton had a narrow escape of being eaten				19110.699039360985
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london				2250.840521335717
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides good lord				696.2824426018927
he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a musketeer apprentice d artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him and fixed his eyes intensely upon the guardsman who had just made this insolent speech				29593.72574712745
indeed said d artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy				13626.342296263976
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his mind instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake more especially one in such a situation as danglars				455.0963467546834
be one or the other but not both replied porthos				145.11854838091634
besides repentance becomes the guilty whatever crimes they may have committed for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of god guilty				2904.3632654612697
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another				581.1330567419161
notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain villefort rose as he perceived her				164.2756501878606
no madame i will not thus waste your time				474.1064096335936
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening				753.0105418084456
d artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son				1000.8477947314003
the young men first approached the dead man				179.29039422554195
as for you your captain is the prince understand that rightly you have no other				472.02592989181335
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play				5690.492540638687

he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure				1281.0869450181128

this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape				1432.1157407387893
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house so that since that time replied d artagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host				788.1975710477399

can he be afraid of this boy but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short he bowed humbly and retired				794.9982856134344
the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past				3883.1220461618245
don t suppose that you are the only person who can serve me monsieur de rochefort				2042.4879426643627

why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and i have noticed that what that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform you have evidently seen and observed everything let us proceed oh yes yes now as regards the second question i am listening was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercédès yes a young man who loved her and his name was fernand that is a spanish name i think he was a catalan you imagine him capable of writing the letter oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me that is in strict accordance with the spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never besides said dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone to no one not even to your mistress no not even to my betrothed then it is danglars i feel quite sure of it now wait a little				1276.7163132969547
but remorse is not thus banished like virgil s wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon villefort uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a chair				1143.3289406470872
if he were alone in the world he would blow out his brains and there would be an end horrible ejaculated the priest				2034.106950671531

we hear from yanina if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance of franz when he quitted the chamber of m noirtier even she would have been constrained to pity him				50.33836209054904
athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask assistance				3670.296909915783
now said valentine motioning to morrel to sit down near her grandfather while she took her seat on his footstool now let us talk about our own affairs				3697.6902180500424
i shall perhaps have something to say to you and he went out				528.1722867411652
then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject porthos called the host and asked for dice				4648.064790137721
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded				11253.04385760902
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word				527.2646367366603
around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette				68208.102493347
the comte de la fere he cried in his turn				1019.6469933994433
project gutenberg is a registered trademark				2395.288734799221
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation				1078.2577734122326
while i watched the window he guarded the door good said athos				152.8704157575135
let us talk a little said she				716.8600261373041
besides do you know what is our situation and whether mazarin s arrest wouldn t be rather an encumbrance than an advantage say at once you disapprove of my proposal i think you ought to do nothing since you exacted a promise from these gentlemen not to let mazarin know that we were in france i have entered into no engagement and consider myself quite free				5893.533790064021
but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in oh i was arranging a little surprise for you indeed				896.9176246762385
excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously				217809.50160387906
he had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog				208799.20795715984
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that d artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two				1157.7917321849418
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion				4625.00102958093
wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones stick out				528.1609535150067
galloping through the bushes the count				290.93045694276714
but what can i do for you then d artagnan told m de tréville a long history about the queen				376.1517587968854
upon my word said monte cristo paris is a strange city and the parisians a very singular people				1043.3271205778199
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse s tail and thus they took me to nîmes				19452.771250469596
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina				217902.57974484118
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility				191097.79290733667
after the king and the cardinal m de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens				179508.4638640211
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop				1660.4636379674207
on seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully				23333.86590303163
oh my god cried anne of austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell				12786.293733211236
what is this gentleman s name asked the commissary				7471.078400952434
i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper				2624.081251943196
are you sure you are more reasonable yes said valentine and i have but one scruple that of leaving my dear grandmother s remains which i had undertaken to watch valentine said morrel death is in itself sacred yes said valentine besides it will not be for long she then crossed the corridor and led the way down a narrow staircase to m noirtier s room morrel followed her on tiptoe at the door they found the old servant				1182.5100631959126
bonacieux was going that was to follow her				164.50367822612452
take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay				216253.04011535857
scarcely had it reached them ere the boy though still pale as marble opened his eyes and eagerly gazed around him				50.33947825179432
d artagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword				947.813662747895
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood				14621.273688727691
they understood then from the few words which escaped from d artagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him d artagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their way				676.9279037773875
he is then the same englishman whom i met at ah yes indeed				896.9266060778834
it wants ten minutes to nine said he				208.99013786415964
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m				666.6330230210214
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black				85424.04686118945
everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands				15126.287100483132
i am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request				5140.274663592187
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome				1929.185537190835
my own service said d artagnan				80.62156876671267
from the day i first saw you all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection				13652.591643807897
i should have thought that his duchess oh porthos s duchess is dressed by her husband s clerks said d artagnan laughing				1259.5523483288252
rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs				3696.4350355144015
farewell monseigneur should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days i shall presume my letter will have miscarried				217944.14532747428
every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine o clock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest s breviary				27688.67708498636
they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the shutter				22453.78846429259
are they made to order precisely said the count six years since i bought a horse in hungary remarkable for its swiftness				195265.52047459694
so the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game				10085.066407603292
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend s ear				1573.202973758263
i should be glad however to receive your excellency s commands concerning the dinner really my dear m bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so				430.4635830704837
a minute afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent				7756.004016190817
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states				2153.7830159620817
but don t sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like sleep				1402.586408730731
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty				173535.00184766555
it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate				201781.1790986744
i used to play almost every night in france and since your return to england i have not handled a card or dice box i sincerely pity you said d artagnan with an air of profound compassion				28515.131495476515
but for heaven s sake resumed aramis				151.94687604954845
therefore mousqueton alone fell from his horse not because he was severely wounded but not being able to see the wound he judged it to be more serious than it really was				868.4837761379151
the house belonged as the concierge informed your excellency to m de saint méran villefort s father in law				2552.081484631393
as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and renée in waiting				2380.726065049234
bad monsieur bad replied the king i am bored this was in fact the worst complaint of louis xiii who would sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say monsieur so and so let us weary ourselves together how				2888.4983127585842
after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto				14733.083165856815
just so then you are called monsieur grimaud the traveler made a sign of assent				2043.9269500770574
what is it i hear a horse it belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us no said d artagnan it is in advance that is another thing said porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by d artagnan				80.11387640672959
it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden				1366.4737874592977
in fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement				12447.69533975237
this evening said the governor when the task was ended				10183.58909306013
at the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her pocket and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her				164.27494519476556
it was about four o clock in the afternoon and although the day was brilliant out of doors we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the cavern				4964.855465257741
count said de winter for whom do you take me for a stranger who does not know paris said athos and to whom the viscount will show the way de winter shook him by the hand				231.95341196027147
vampa approached the corpse and recognized cucumetto				14702.723122128933
gentlemen said the queen laughing pray take up your abode in the chateau it is large and there will be no want of room for you all but as we never thought of coming here i am informed that there are in all only three beds in the whole establishment one for the king one for me and one for the cardinal muttered the prince				1270.8047299191428
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man				179.05681050843785
the queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lips and without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter				2546.1024341860434
since his majesty still lives since the honor of the throne is safe everything else is a matter of indifference to me athos turned pale and laid his hand on his heart				360.67580488844095
he would have spoken but his voice failed him				50.39991990434039
their intense happiness isolated them from all the rest of the world and they only spoke in broken words which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the expression of sorrow				3045.416103688354
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out				528.139546973533
as d artagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith				2131.1342686360713
wait an instant and he pointed his gun at d artagnan who was riding toward him at full speed				3586.922999231481

the sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor				169908.36246414034
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia				217941.65116894027
no d artagnan considered that things are never well done when they are not reserved to their proper time				473.8471764601886
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents				187062.90143211005
well i must confess it does replied d artagnan				80.1906977743363
so i have been told already monseigneur cried bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but i swear to you that i know nothing about it the cardinal repressed a smile				397.49459305897756

meanwhile danglars stooping to monte cristo s ear your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the names fernand and yanina indeed said monte cristo				202.1437411967263
they locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the day				483.11625602988425
this letter had been conveyed by d artagnan and had arrived in time				473.88852673751114

i do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice my dear d artagnan replied aramis you understand when i was a musketeer i mounted guard as seldom as i could now when i am an abbé i say as few masses as i can				9347.330817685319
never exclaimed athos raising his right hand to heaven never				8975.799520747578
he started when he saw renée for he fancied she was again about to plead for dantès				540.6047226528333
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before				775.2099292861132
the president again arose and having imposed silence said sir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimed if you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the general s anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said i will not swear then you must die replied the president calmly				18228.340668242658
shall i send the father to you immediately very well the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the ladies and took their leave albert perfectly indifferent to mademoiselle danglars contempt monte cristo reiterating his advice to madame danglars on the prudence a banker s wife should exercise in providing for the future				1442.267140493405
proceed said he to the host				790.3182879805025
m de villefort passed on to his own room				219.43541847204824
since that period of history queens have shed tears like other women				2058.4435728980056
two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle				9617.530921321999
i have begun a poem in verses of one syllable				14398.449866415238
men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the rue du helder their walk on the boulevard de gand and the café de paris it is of course understood that albert resided in the aforesaid street appeared every day on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters				212207.09008290348
meanwhile the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on				528.3987503803831
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me				126.08436618675964
but tell me said andrea am i to remain bareheaded pooh said caderousse it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off come come enough of this said cavalcanti				1280.7791036021615
how very singular cried monte cristo with well feigned astonishment				893.8751230259666
the latter his heart palpitating more than ever entered the courtyard without dismounting				193150.61415927814
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo				202.165526430795
cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night and the bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the fire				2491.3179111935383
they were parting to meet again when it pleased god and if it pleased god				569.4601987381842
ten men for monsieur de comminges as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent streets				37504.852696474394
at length an honorable peer morcerf s acknowledged enemy ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected moment had arrived				1867.7874056470334
she descended and went through the passage				2867.1133489153203
thank you parry when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall				12308.989133081765
do not speak so loud young man don t speak so loud				158816.5235848068
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another				581.096479922785
the cardinal s refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence				30662.019851397017
and by what gate did they go out by the saint maur gate if you are deceiving me rascal you will be hanged to morrow and if you catch up with them you won t come back to hang me murmured the sergeant				7062.184680704012
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river				6214.041003740018
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind and you albert i replied the viscount i saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything				1025.3407402149842
good god cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon she will never write like monsieur de voiture what does you mean by boor michon said the swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came				6157.515093547887
i can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own				1169.3465895349782
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she i am sure of it nevertheless i confess i still doubt but the fleur de lis on her shoulder she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been branded in consequence athos she is your wife i tell you repeated d artagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other yes but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually it was d artagnan who now shook his head in his turn				1019.47197441498
i knew very well that he was incapable of defending me but as he could serve us in other ways i wished to inform him of what oh that is not my secret i must not therefore tell you besides said d artagnan pardon me madame if guardsman as i am i remind you of prudence besides i believe we are not here in a very proper place for imparting confidences				159833.02513058498
there seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king louis xviii was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphius s rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horace a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch				39029.013523257316
you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriage contract				156534.23302389652
for the people had learned that broussel and blancmesnil had made speeches in their behalf and although the eloquence of these deputies had been without avail it had none the less won for them the people s good will				1730.438334204477
he stopped at a short distance from the house and alighted				10214.090972278167
two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand but albert a first rate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo				169884.70667380467
now as i dislike him and hope his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths will ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take place what was the cause of your quarrel when he was in england he seduced the wife of one of my friends why do you not seek revenge i have already fought three duels with him said the englishman the first with the pistol the second with the sword and the third with the sabre and what was the result of those duels the first time he broke my arm the second he wounded me in the breast and the third time made this large wound the englishman turned down his shirt collar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent one				372.0571068957612
she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke someone will come she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner				687.2988488136543
he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors				189819.62812409297
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti oh do not confound the two eugénie hold your tongue				5533.142515609976
we have the first throw ha				205328.13860810394
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring				179309.47722752058
in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose				217459.568221073
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken				6451.642046168341
she tried to replace the arm but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse				19558.374341025527
retire valentine said she you are really suffering and these ladies will excuse you drink a glass of pure water it will restore you valentine kissed eugénie bowed to madame danglars who had already risen to take her leave and went out				528.1141120933847
great undertakings come poorly off with paltry means well returned mazarin we will satisfy you richelieu thought d artagnan would have given me five hundred pistoles in advance you will then be at my service asked mazarin				778.4715300555298
danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it				88.9214071997197
in the midst of his amorous projects for the mercer s wife he did not forget his friends				429.70888482505154
have you a good horse monsieur de bragelonne my horse was killed this morning my lord and i am mounted provisionally on my lackey s choose for yourself in my stables the horse you like best				3588.2778745634796
now then go go in the name of heaven				741.8464666287898
as we have said he perfectly understood the old man s vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing				2779.215607318515
a love as tender as that of a lover for his mistress dwells undoubtedly in some paternal hearts toward a son				1000.8248874054797
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden morrel looked at her with astonishment				893.6726853377726
bazin wore his dress it may be observed with equal dignity and saintly propriety				175308.85458790488
napoleon would doubtless have deprived villefort of his office had it not been for noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the girondin of 93 and the senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had been his protector				10542.673627467175
now my lord he would like to have one of his three estates erected into a barony only that said mazarin his eyes twinkling with joy on seeing that he could pay for porthos s devotion without opening his purse only that				539.1761898645984
a terrible howling interrupted these reflections of d artagnan and mme				194.61556176040924
it was one of the gascon s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty				27221.605122953108
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind				9567.180536884563
yes in landed property no in stock yes the stock is in your own hands the look which m noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find				48905.38087851922
when he arrives i will not fail to do so just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to madame de villefort				302.9858150448106
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says				23846.83393102479
jesus seigneur no sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and athos and aramis rushed out				528.1254443144247
d artagnan took possession of his command				4343.547649490172
the cardinal as his majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the king s gaming table				750.2068213828794
the small and angular head of this man his white hair and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall				12310.186545533146
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother				1345.4425398841945
in a quarter of an hour we set off that s the advice i was about to give monsieur and where are we going may i ask without being too curious pardieu in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone				2979.511320887743
has she left armentières grimaud made a sign in the affirmative				5267.992304445948
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count bad replied athos very bad but you received it with enthusiasm as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear d herblay				8084.466128998802
look at me madame at me whom you accuse of speaking loud and threateningly				217917.95808641397
i was still unable to divine for what reason m de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth				2400.5930920233723
oh monsieur you can write as much as you like you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade				175778.27584449382
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard				711.311563515428
but you may use it replied lord wilmore i understand it and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation				1078.258801719468
here is a beautiful lawn let us go on straight forwards bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow but obeyed however he continued to take the left hand				231.95407558525557
now you have done grimaud take our brigadier s half pike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king grimaud obeyed without replying				151506.93648037018
monsieur bazin the beadle said the verger				165051.8915618363
eat heartily grimaud smiled and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held in his hand he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it				88.82686079857545
but i as you see am nailed to my bed ah				256.575723552094
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling				36985.42058103918
wretched men their officers wish to see you sir i have no time to see them				157.71529740427277
the executioner who had lifted himself up fell back upon his bed				692.0786148525702
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king				425.0058963541039
that neutrality consists simply in excluding king charles from the territory of france and in refraining from helping him a stranger to your country with arms with money or with troops				58473.10442442279
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down				837.4770719649161
you will be here at half past nine and i shall find your eminence ready certainly quite ready well then it is a settled thing and now my lord will you obtain for me an audience with the queen for what purpose i wish to receive her majesty s commands from her own lips she desired me to give them to you she may have forgotten something you really wish to see her it is indispensable my lord mazarin hesitated for one instant but d artagnan was firm				14692.40683853918
they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning				15160.789031473672
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me				126.12531572019103
but he bethought him of m de villefort s promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible				6466.955966960699
the dead once buried in their graves rise no more and i tell you sir that you are mistaken				2021.4403682951818
oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hair oh who will deliver me from this man				179.04827261793068
where is your master you monsieur d artagnan cried grimaud impossible grimaud said athos coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown grimaud i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak ah monsieur it is silence grimaud contented himself with pointing d artagnan out to his master with his finger				1409.9242732631992
did i advise your father to sell the castle of yanina to betray silence said albert with a thundering voice				412.83122948819107
at the branching off of the road toward paris aramis who had followed in the cardinal s suite turned back				804.0810934944358
but was it my father s ring				3453.878344637446
who went out this morning athos asked uneasily				5283.690368129338
aramis whom we have sent for that s true said athos we must wait for aramis at that moment aramis entered				726.9870557342886
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes				246075.80749178745
they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties				219362.10266431072
besides were not those riches chimerical offspring of the brain of the poor abbé faria had they not died with him				50.33985031104246
i could never agree to it still you have thought of it incessantly alas cried the abbé				797.930212846456
you know what it is to love my lord				696.3617983122127
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator s wife and not to say a word of the wound that s agreed you have my word oh he would kill me don t be afraid he is not so much of a devil as he appears saying these words d artagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interested his debt and his life				469.1684516473894
adieu edmond adieu and thank you but the count did not answer				803.4494725541037
i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said				496.57147570649096
madame we are yours body and soul oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years i have felt the least approach to joy or hope				1245.4522665599968
his eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter see here it is and kindly add continued he that i am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary bernouin re entered the cabinet returning in a few seconds				22959.820793159237
then he rested he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be going				2129.1942025804037
besides which in a short time resumed d artagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety well then i decide i have your word then yes tis given				3037.4019889910887
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him				50.33836209054904
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice				21752.79055599392
this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party				2464.080826793714
then the two wings of the window facing the square had been thrown open and the people had seen silently advancing from the interior of the vast chamber first a masked man who carrying an axe in his hand was recognized as the executioner				1704.0921630196879
carmela was precisely the age and figure of teresa and teresa was as handsome as carmela				32060.301819662393
morrel looked at his watch which wanted a quarter to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or three times rectified the error by striking half past nine				4597.033595458561
go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day to morrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after to morrow five and in three days you will be in bed				692.0271353944912
the carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore albert had not an instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes expectations and claims to notice				21752.769810926147
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject				1692.588546447335
he gave us some very fine horses and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own				1169.3521654273193
then she knew that he was one of the friends of m de tréville and consequently that he belonged body and soul to the king which would make him lose a part of his advantage since when known to milady as he knew her he played only an equal game with her				164.27416187265285
review your life albert although it is only just beginning did a lovely summer s day ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career				36862.80701168981
seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them				157.7055211204376
one might have fancied that some giant had cleaved them with blows from a hatchet				14058.754757123897

it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face				673.0084266872659
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimaud s shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them				157.70567152021437
ha ha ha and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle				237385.67217729246
the eight guards were at their posts				11798.263355296793
certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count s assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him was not that nearly what you said 20222m it was well then did he ask you who is m albert de morcerf				1583.9858244253564
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went				3236.0153031570917
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed				3489.0636606899084
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself				1007.5938052387087
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart				360.6773527443948
d artagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression				6307.138285579327
troops five or six thousand men courage plenty then the thing is easy				1567.0830869393697
well asked the cardinal on seeing la houdinière return				1261.0890226345211
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in she passed first				1026.5500644513384
when the hour appointed for the audience arrived athos was obliged to stay until the queen who was waited upon by a new deputation from paris had consulted with her minister as to the propriety and manner of receiving them				157.70559632030805
the procureur exerted himself to reply				1030.5246243624636
heaven pardon me cried edmond falling on his knees before his father				446.67422635481864
he put one hand on his heart to still its beating and the other over his eyes that he might not witness the slaying of his faithful friends				429.7049917205807
contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below				2988.0251802059847
or at least i will go later he drew kitty to him				50.354662903120904
he again struck it and with greater force				3122.233059783012
at the noise felton made in entering milady leaped lightly to the ground and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand				231.95418618960417
i i detest i loathe it very fine anne				8601.373028917285
how does it happen that you are in paris rochefort cried the two friends				429.71892509935793
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused				178666.29482698752
nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french speak italian sir				538.6653187501853
he promised to be here and i have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad but if he does not come said d artagnan				80.11395280931234
d artagnan slipped into the wardrobe				28198.836021037776
de saint méran said madame de villefort then this house belonged to m de saint méran before you bought it it appears so replied monte cristo				202.1443195354362
at the same time he felt the duke s arms on his shoulders like two iron claws but instead either of calling out or defending himself he placed his forefinger on his lips and said in a low tone hush smiling as he uttered the word				527.2573456253132
this valet whose name was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master held in one hand a number of papers and in the other a packet of letters which he gave to albert				433.8002402510458
i have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of and here i am mme				194.55311742665444
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part				9597.620819531694
i never meddle save with what concerns me and i know how to make believe that i haven t seen what does not concern me but i hate hypocrites and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers and he added turning to porthos here s a gentleman who s of the same opinion as myself porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture				3262.6307123150063
the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious and then that which was inconceivable in athos who was always retiring was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society those manners of a high degree which appeared as if unconsciously to himself in his least actions				37091.600473001585
yes i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child				828.2756805111263
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone work				1090.6610517215988
both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay				216170.97417277528
madame de villefort however reassured by the silence which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of valentine again extended her hand and half hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass				1119.8834331036
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp				2462.469301607394
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad				35392.647383780764
cocles thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity				13173.504647628657
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer tis true man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions				35115.71258147591
upon gaining this advantage d artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman				931.7546336547786
as to m de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past				3883.1257493973535
the general doubted my fidelity no but i wish to have a share in my revenge				10256.356344998221
is she there grimaud asked athos				153.99660566982283
there was something grave and solemn in the approach of the young girl which struck the old man and immediately his bright eye began to interrogate				11711.629848376211
for that reason i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against everyone but especially against him				50.33951425740783
meanwhile lord de winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of buckingham s household had all made their way into the chamber				720.0879516938917
yes athos you may laugh but as long as we were within gunshot of the pier or of the vessels lying by it i was looking for a frightful discharge of musketry which would crush us but said porthos with great wisdom that was impossible for they would have killed the captain and the sailors bah				5467.657341792091
the queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise and asked him what was going on				528.3556669497917
come then thou regenerate man thou extravagant prodigal thou awakened sleeper thou all powerful visionary thou invincible millionaire once again review thy past life of starvation and wretchedness revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted and where despair received thee				51400.02765936166
never mind where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends during this conversation dantès after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good fellows there is some little mistake to clear up that s all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that 0075m oh to be sure responded danglars who had now approached the group nothing more than a mistake i feel quite certain dantès descended the staircase preceded by the magistrate and followed by the soldiers				3864.579927153138
it was now nine o clock				885.3217493664974
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness				217947.05521517317
he was not long in making his toilet				10380.046222464334
well three days after that you talked politics with m debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain				16898.620306520694
twice you have pronounced that word certainly				11162.54409793918
then he added aloud yes sir i am hungry very hungry and your excellency wants something to eat at once if possible nothing easier said peppino				4840.5293226278345
what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed everything				1025.3827882456999
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview				8758.047504598344
it is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you				95.7123639112194
come let us see them here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table 15 000 francs in gold and 30 000 francs in bank notes				16993.550043620922
i wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday				213368.660415773
and if you wish ever to leave my palace you can not so make the best of it				88.83096942053709
let us not misunderstand each other replied monte cristo i introduce no one and certainly not m cavalcanti and who said albert with a forced smile is to marry mademoiselle danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly what				670.0151853918264
still you must breakfast somewhere but if i am not hungry said the young man				179.05313916562736
i have the power of so doing said monte cristo				202.23465707291055
oh oh said he here is a soup which is rather inviting what the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup said porthos at the sight of a pale liquid abundant but entirely free from meat on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the islands of an archipelago				137857.36439251233
but we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it				88.82910569217961
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement				3956.8861205942885
however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian life a life of politeness visiting and introductions monte cristo bowed without making any answer he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty				3595.385655478049
a horse he cried i have found a horse and i likewise said athos				152.85758689998764
she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch				16865.51872513383
you have not returned that visit and you were wrong monseigneur i feared i had incurred disgrace with your eminence how could that be monsieur				1109.4318932528606
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied d artagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia				217939.98841244163
what does scandal signify to me				126.78540315137542
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take				11556.78688499529
d artagnan was too grand to promise anything he purposed only to do all that he could to increase the glory of his name				579.4694821214154
with the four hundred livres we will make the half of one for one of the unmounted and then we will give the turnings out of our pockets to d artagnan who has a steady hand and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to				6945.856235121053
he had only to step over the corpse enter the boudoir take the child in his arms and flee far far away				594.8464350473729
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me				126.05731431932409
inside the cup was a small piece of paper on which were written these words from lord ruthven to countess g precisely i was sure of it said morcerf				1583.982803215041
he laid every action of his life before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to man than to god forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us yet in spite of his earnest prayers dantès remained a prisoner				687.2985210841026
i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me it is but christian charity replied d artagnan not to lead one s neighbors into temptation it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them d artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute italian				11507.285832185264
what are you thinking of this evening bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage				673.37147992267
the president put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take place				1078.9469590895715
go then and take the waters of forges or any that may be more agreeable to you and recuperate yourself as quickly as possible				849.4291479621968
then he sent his card to signor pastrini and asked for albert de morcerf				1583.826463446234
see what she writes to me athos said he				208.8805469182668
at that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone and as one of them drooped over the road he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion				16357.818253501799
two well trained servingmen were in attendance on the company				3086.0109776184045
mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father now a madman and her brother who died last september with his mother				1345.4117455007417
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran s morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear				1176.552664948245
what beautiful furniture there must be in it have you ever seen the tuileries no well it surpasses that it must be worth one s while to stoop andrea when that good m monte cristo lets fall his purse it is not worthwhile to wait for that said andrea money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard but you should take me there one day with you how can i				668.1334916245269
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that d artagnan heard her in the antechamber				3180.1720875913325
there is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the frondeurs who besides don t understand political matters as we old soldiers do never fear dear friend said porthos				145.0387851121856
the angel was a demon the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church and what did the count do the count was of the highest nobility				191097.61066236655

and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs				3697.693744443915
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother ah excuse me then said d artagnan				80.11383820546554

he calls me his dear monsieur said the mercer to himself				264.2767377800581
call for help useless said athos useless				13560.797256486501
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow				1392.2548219193147
of what country are you asked the prince				1270.89199215093
the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface dantès touched it and found that it was a beam				156849.38701934667
and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent said aramis				151.56494509117618
they re entered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the halles and taking up grimaud and blaisois they went on foot to the rue guenegaud				80684.87911568323
d artagnan crossed the quays went out by the gate of la conférence and followed the road much more beautiful then than it is now which leads to st				2870.692034899389
but all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hôtel				4128.247465816333
are you alone athos parbleu whom do you expect to find with me at this hour well well and d artagnan rushed into athos s chamber				720.0879516938917
i have now to confess to you				95.99331970113701

nevertheless let not your majesty be uneasy we will find means and i have none either said the queen				376.1528349772392
the sergeant answered that puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket				1334.3103601619662
and yet you say he has sent you some as from us here is his letter said d artagnan and he presented the note to his comrades				7484.364029232231
dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend				526.2285511313067
while working night and day i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering but sir he has fled let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal				5836.983472870371

i hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else i warn you i will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion				3958.7016292655335
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself				1007.6072581571844
he was very successful upon that question				910.6724067496104
on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the night and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected				194241.0295576696
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation				33589.29647928709
but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight no no by no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground				1793.3819653785233

is it about sending me to the bastile				15590.321653395804
pardon me then a fault which is perhaps great but which certainly was involuntary milady was so beautiful at this moment the religious ecstasy in which she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance that felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he had only just before heard				711.3112243357243
a loud cry could be heard by her				164.5431390158716
i faith colonel said d artagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast				3914.070441618234

it appeared to the young man that the guards on seeing him depart chuckled among themselves				1680.9277216558623
i confess it but pardon to every sin				169630.37218154554

he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help				5680.721707131402
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him				50.54521346181757
