porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied				6310.597833617206
d artagnan overcoming his repugnance to mordaunt walked with him upon the deck and invented a hundred stories to make him talk				6463.299750608159
so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of a legion of cæsars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads he who dreads nothing as it is said				496.57147570649096

then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar				13910.87593130579
you are not wrong after all and life is sweet				15665.257925544256
oh muttered mazarin i do believe he is going off with the diamond				2604.6153951667384

and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat				2696.3862777556938

i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real enemy and by the rapid glance that the young man s eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness				6712.761335863572
for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear marie i know only one other woman who can do it as well				642.6670073516758

he was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber but grated and barred and its appearance therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the words of villefort who seemed to interest himself so much resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom				4651.701058566194
the procurator s wife waited tremblingly				17729.119792566475

we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to speak				976.0096197121348

now said albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are				1193.2056007148274
but at the first word the young woman started and exclaimed in a sharp bantering tone which sounded strangely in the darkness are you afraid dear monsieur d artagnan you can not think so dear love replied d artagnan but now suppose this poor comte de wardes were less guilty than you think him at all events said milady seriously he has deceived me and from the moment he deceived me he merited death he shall die then since you condemn him said d artagnan in so firm a tone that it appeared to milady an undoubted proof of devotion				4474.418796445263

the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way				676.9362962232378
dantès was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead				2464.6331223703846
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself				264.2318795467692
i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party				2464.073777012005

you are welcome count she exclaimed as he entered				727.1489613847108
the young man burst into a laugh				2731.5444253310043
i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him				50.33842209858862

another proof that he was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements				13120.569318998218
oh and more especially a notorious coward oh oh				1081.6152698882338

i am as certain of it as that we two are christians the abbé with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him half full swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale cheeks				1540.7806744827194
the young man gazed at him as if he would have read the secret of his heart				360.68578007667844

you too then are unhappy she said				497.49270754236437
he shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when madame danglars recovered from her half fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream				1101.4787083455499
mousqueton exclaimed d artagnan draw up the blinds of his majesty s carriage it is he cried porthos				145.04466382130062

being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob				18488.063747128977
athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him				50.37552075301806

my private ambition tends only to the profit of him who has justice on his side good thought d artagnan in this direction i am satisfied he pressed aramis s hand and went in search of porthos				145.03871595231996

as villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brother in law is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of 1814 and we can not molest napoleon without breaking those compacts oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m de salvieux				40010.30627857361

why having recognized you and i the only one to do so why was i able to save my son alone				858.3619499722473

the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief				17914.085652357262

as soon as the identity of my brother was proved i was set at liberty				3157.184692496989
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villefort s departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind				473.3070170951629

but we must not lose time				475.91457813725987

the count watched him with a feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in l impartial who not only surrendered the castle of yanina but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that time fernand as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name				579.4689294965167

go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances and now i am convinced said d artagnan that this abduction of the queen s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration				1480.7732131205064
everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity				28935.659593936223
all these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was concerned				12837.880417011062
they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us oh exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was d artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping aramis shook his head				426.9290058744706
did your excellency desire to see me inquired he				208.88044731628412
all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard				32585.153610972397
i assure you i intend to play the devil s game to night d artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets				21993.385087289855
d artagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile				397.49554076106807
this room was occupied by dantès father				447.63414121187157
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown up daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise one s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done but m d épinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family				1594.9444891592768
you are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation i have become simple in my tastes and am without passion i hope				1245.455829832611
my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when i hear it tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it what do you mean sir inquired raoul				841.511709261822
the latter had surpassed himself he showed la ramee a monstrous pate ornamented with monsieur de beaufort s coat of arms				513.9477961939281
close to the hedge the steps stopped				2091.1016273235896
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon				38507.306702252215
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money				609.3673126301263
as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission the young man s eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself				264.2321315380465
the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features				5873.155404316958
since you say i am sold to cross the tyne reach scotland and rejoin lord montrose who will not sell you and what shall i do in scotland				15610.838236498445
to the smaller i see that you are the friends of these gentlemen well what has happened to them they were pursued by eight of the light dragoons who rode into the courtyard before they had time to close the gate eight said aramis it surprises me that two such heroes as porthos and d artagnan should have allowed themselves to be arrested by eight men the eight men would doubtless have failed had they not been assisted by twenty soldiers of the regiment of italians in the king s service who are in garrison in this town so that your friends were overpowered by numbers arrested were they inquired athos is it known why no sir they were carried off instantly and had not even time to tell me why but as soon as they were gone i found this broken sword blade as i was helping to raise two dead men and five or six wounded ones tis still a consolation that they were not wounded said aramis				151.46885407360074
presently they heard milady retire to her room				219.6057256089633
means for classical tragedy chapter lviii				37192.37417859725
every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart				360.7889878693932
yes you are right maximilian i will follow you				95.77810694443731
really exclaimed porthos opening his great wondering eyes				492.70101739449825
you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied				34648.198860840406
what says augustine on this subject severus sit clericorum verbo yes let the sermon be clear said the curate				4566.569230676472
joy joy the sum is large five or six millions is it not yes you know the amount on the receipt of the count of monte cristo why how came you to be so well acquainted with all this i told you we were informed beforehand then why do you apply to me that i may be sure i have the right man yes it is indeed he				208.75478745701335
there was no time to lose				2219.294453459178
well that tends to confirm my own ideas said franz that the countess s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason				3545.090129044249
dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire				48103.159218498884
some one must go for help said a lad who could not comprehend that this little man should make a stand against that other man who was so large				35492.15601459118
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you dantès took the hand of the abbé in his and affectionately pressed it				88.82732671522399
nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer				11679.963715658538
but i love her my lord and was jealous				21335.79709398932
never sir replied the jailer never on the contrary he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories				5711.304590000032
i wore a long sword which cut like a damascus you remember it aramis for you always called it balizarde				17896.053814855117
to nobody in the world not even to athos or porthos i have not breathed a syllable to them good enough tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with d artagnan and both soon arrived at athos s dwelling				31990.574831046877
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him				50.33925021684014
i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity				3155.089783365986
yes if it isn t contrary to the rules oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that anyone can possibly understand what we are saying i have been told said the count that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat that is true sir and that is what i like best said the man smiling				827.9499086802191
here are the horse s hoofs again it seems athos he said carelessly				5810.169795732383
will our help come from you yes you are sure of it yes there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power				3632.62913453051
you were among them you were				2610.062185426194
she turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded panther				34852.07748940331
the side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross				18570.79943301926
no sentinels no one at any of the windows				1467.9290203576409
i feel my head a little confused i will take a turn in the garden go and where shall i find you here in an hour here in an hour				1300.2798844128204
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows				1468.0270184629958
i spurred on and found myself in the enemy s ranks and the prince was pleased with you he told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken				1648.7159256635825
he has not been unreasonably exacting it seems to me				126.12284995357221
the one seemed to be deprived of reason yet he was meditating				40610.04098373295
the journey at two o clock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barrière st denis				5710.994135141646
come said the captain we have done all in our power and m morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves				3276.003210730117
in no instance let us say was this worthy gentleman accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his minions				28817.18825616428
your eminence said the august visitor it was my first intention to speak of the matters that have brought me here to the queen my sister but i have reflected that political affairs are more especially the concern of men madame said mazarin your majesty overwhelms me with flattering distinction he is very gracious thought the queen can he have guessed my errand give continued the cardinal your commands to the most respectful of your servants alas sir replied the queen i have lost the habit of commanding and have adopted instead that of making petitions				37294.06186452013
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber				720.0879516938917
oh oh said andrea you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me				126.06416691008839
then he must be playing in the garden go and see 50193m no sir madame de villefort sent for him half an hour ago he went into her room and has not been downstairs since a cold perspiration burst out on villefort s brow his legs trembled and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch				1831.5135276433302
a fine prize friend mordaunt we have both myself and monsieur du vallon taken two knights of the garter nothing less but said mordaunt looking at athos and aramis with bloodshot eyes these are frenchmen i imagine i faith i don t know				1128.7066145114889
it is m maximilian morrel said she the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless recollect yes said the old man				179.04366232633382
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him				50.338386093756284
if you are young i will be your comrade if you are old i will be your son				1000.828705256723
gentlemen said athos addressing at the same time his companions and their adversaries are we ready yes answered the englishmen and the frenchmen as with one voice				412.828473551606
you also stand aside he said to the masked man				179.10633830255728
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety				13027.890919396486
whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham replied milady				406.6468265634404
and i say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes mr				6853.4347307555745
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself				264.2321315380465
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his hand				231.98416191195537
i left the boat between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the road to nîmes we are getting to the story now yes your excellency excuse me but as you will see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary				3524.862886406825
suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress ah said he good good				1725.3942096466812
so you hate each other said the count				289.19229471032634
there is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from you				95.69821680125483
he lives at the bedford tavern greenhall street				1654.969939305335
speak speak said valentine i entreat you has your resolution changed valentine it can not change unhappy man you know it must not cried the young girl				991.2065319424139
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive				42153.04305521405
well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper				32112.04600255878
pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly				4152.234179841639
he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find him				50.33904618644095
but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty				1937.7310291977215
40142m high walls not more than eight or ten feet that is not prudent said caderousse				528.76144546928
i will wear it i swear to you as a grateful man should do tis well arise vicomte embrace me raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count s arms				513.9419145618247
monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time pistache s patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth				6158.695531746026
this time d artagnan was not hasty				44525.41640184938
the three listeners looked at one another in alarm				11506.890767660845
this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone				858.3652243694762
i believe these fellows have managed their business				4802.814221161944
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are				1193.2056007148274
by the way planchet i think you are right with respect to our host and that he is decidedly a frightfully low wretch ah monsieur you may take my word when i tell you anything				1876.7928349309632
that depends upon the sentiments with which you may inspire me then today madame oh today i am no further than gratitude ah				256.5095435308193
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we have the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes				492.3651703519621
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion				1726.3867098741853
the day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous				30089.673902271552
this is all very strange said m de tréville after meditating a minute you mentioned my name then aloud yes sir i certainly committed that imprudence but why should i have done otherwise				5545.890134278825
i am not precisely rich though i am pretty well off hold madame said porthos let us say no more upon the subject i beg of you				95.69734978833321
some one la ramee ran in haste to obey the call				4193.797803955257
he found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants but his eye vainly sought rita and cucumetto among them				157.70649872155042
while mercédès as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to albert s while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave everything in perfect order she did not perceive a pale and sinister face at a glass door which threw light into the passage from which everything could be both seen and heard				711.3112243357243
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death				781.2255279552935
at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless				4189.476553622462
the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat				36262.932987123364
having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again				391.9712695840471
you told me to open the door if i heard anyone cry out said the soldier but you forgot to leave me the key				6780.11733746073
follow me said morrel i will take you to my sister who is worthy also to be yours				2985.0402882716426
the three young people separated that is to say morrel went to the boulevards château renaud to the pont de la révolution and debray to the quai				14629.586635182552
valentine promised all that morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz				603.9025349328417
he still felt the same self satisfaction which he had experienced the previous evening and which had procured him so good a night s rest				742.0240653444513
then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons				35238.160251721856
yes yes continued morrel recall the scene for the words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears				2957.3228055969253
major cavalcanti both the count and baptistin had told the truth when they announced to morcerf the proposed visit of the major which had served monte cristo as a pretext for declining albert s invitation				9892.701440566814
that s right said athos put your other hand here and he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers				9533.144930156306
i can not make you share the fate i have planned for myself				767.7506777648753
he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life				469.22416047539616
everyone held the accusing paper but as usual no one liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack				5812.6249816272475
danglars lost five hundred thousand francs but he rid himself of all his spanish shares				36446.4437263409
never mind continued the man in the cloak you were a fool not to have pretended to accept the mission				4207.037061885074
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch				36237.799839572006
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over				1848.5524381190053
a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest				2034.4037732860393
the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the defence				11266.659933567047

this is all very fine dear aramis murmured d artagnan				80.15927237603991
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room				219.26032943629752
i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man				179.06176267147686
that was d artagnan s road as he was going to the louvre				3182.2320585730686
i threw and i lost what my horse your horse seven against eight a point short you know the proverb athos you are not in your right senses i swear my dear lad that was yesterday when i was telling you silly stories it was proper to tell me that and not this morning				871.0929501459249
these horses evidently belonged to the three men who were dressed as cavaliers				21794.923068742162
remember to go to the count on the 26th may at seven o clock in the evening				753.0033605745514
while the rest slept then we went away a short distance we severed our fetters with a file the englishman had given us and swam away and what is become of this benedetto i don t know you ought to know no in truth we parted at hyères and to give more weight to his protestation caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé who remained motionless in his place as calm as ever and pursuing his interrogation				13244.905855616797
we are not in the time of malatesta and castruccio castracani				44476.10202033438
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night				877.9760908423068
they were influenced by hatred by avarice and by self love but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment				6840.023040392479
two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as escort				6532.530805644173
for my part i declare i want two thousand four times two makes eight then said aramis it is eight thousand that we want to complete our outfits toward which it is true we have already the saddles besides said athos waiting till d artagnan who went to thank monsieur de tréville had shut the door besides there is that beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend				526.2225289579206
your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl				991.2074772310764
while the boat was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it felton untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound milady s hands together				1576.77103179597
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron s pension that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers				21797.147204863544
i landed here regulated the affairs of the vessel and hastened to visit my affianced bride whom i found more lovely than ever				1264.4266264641963
mistrust everything in short even your own shadow fortunately said d artagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have i hope only men to dread in the meantime said athos i renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go i will go with you				95.69693910074358
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinal s directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman				7885.885687643796
i only speak that exact truth and you say that one of your friends lives in that house i say so and i repeat it for the third time that house is one inhabited by my friend and that friend is aramis all this will be cleared up at a later period murmured the young woman no monsieur be silent if you could see my heart said d artagnan you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity				3155.0927922955134
as to the sailors of the pharaon they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared				585.3369208019682
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed				37530.57828659041
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time but if you yourselves should be struck said athos				152.84490488324786
for one second d artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d artagnan recognized the coadjutor				3972.869239851778
the principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep mme				194.57074455471331
spare me then i beseech you				96.54002924408948
i prize it it was given to my ancestor by king francis i				668.1596165870616
from whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife from monsieur laporte did he give you any details he knew none himself and you have learned nothing from any other quarter yes i have received what i fear i am committing a great imprudence you always come back to that but i must make you see this time that it is too late to retreat i do not retreat mordieu cried the citizen swearing in order to rouse his courage				1617.3388735594879
meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone				858.3570383998242
alack cried the cardinal a venetian glass oh my lord said d artagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the palais royal whether they be venetian or parisian but what do you advise then asked mazarin trembling				3720.35652721958

d artagnan would have remonstrated at this but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and d artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince				1270.8047299191428
that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the banker s house				465.2869997436822
as he approached it noirtier s gaze followed him and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart				360.67614885585664
i have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have tomorrow				1440.352406397705
there was then amongst that crowd a moment s hesitation which looked like shame				3060.3022330675326
what is that exclaimed the queen				377.33867972815017
you count who are more than mortal will i am sure lead me to death by a pleasant path will you not 50267m my friend said the count i have still one doubt are you weak enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings no indeed i am calm said morrel giving his hand to the count my pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual				2907.3104597881365
indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault s stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect what a dire misfortune said emmanuel thinking of morcerf and danglars				455.0963467546834
the general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly room				219.26043398779484
the young man now knew her secret her terrible secret the secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except himself				264.2320055423778
he seated himself at his desk and d artagnan proceeded to examine his face as he had just examined the letter he held but the envelope which covered his countenance appeared as impenetrable as that which covered the letter				592.0198433552512
to doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony				44769.90629178147
monte cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden gate working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string				17333.808526935096
now after what you told me this morning of your heart i may believe well count replied morrel gayly i will not dispute it but you will not make me your confidant maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret				1505.684322666837
oh yes she said i saw but i can not believe would you rather die then and cause maximilian s death oh repeated the young girl almost bewildered can i not leave the house can i not escape valentine the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere your servants will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape				48859.182665294575
he was a man of forty to forty five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion				5416.748130293742
neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her				164.27604185199849
which are your windows asked he of the count with as much indifference as he could assume				11671.312010675234
we shall soon see said porthos in his tranquil way				677.0712352134176
his eyes remained open and menacing				36202.290536030065
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself				264.2389353933733
valentine said the count summon up all your courage still the beatings of your heart do not let a sound escape you and feign to be asleep then you will see valentine seized the count s hand				231.95330135629206
mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and d artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant				1196.8976236282078
kitty went to her mistress and did not leave the door open but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women				2058.7086064022237
i must confess to you count said danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me				126.05725421052689
you see i give you a wide range				44058.83477599689
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it with such a heart as yours and such a sword one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed				38105.96919786931
madame de villefort gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl s heart				360.6759768721078
how are you sir asked morrel with a sickness of heart				360.7456369999169
the city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon which the invited ladies were to be placed the city grocer had ornamented the chambers with two hundred flambeaux of white wax a piece of luxury unheard of at that period and twenty violins were ordered and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate upon condition said the report that they should be played all night				877.9430179869341
it will be useless for him to find you here she rang the bell and kitty appeared				1102.8561862314284
when all had gone out and the door was closed m de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man				179.0439184505304
athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired				2665.831596894162
one now and then i don t say much about but seven in two days i repeat it is too many it is far too many therefore sire your majesty sees that they are come quite contrite and repentant to offer you their excuses quite contrite and repentant				28136.0850515332
but my lord think of what you re about to do and beware of going too far what do you say				954.3537342210496
well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject but before the notary could answer villefort had drawn him aside				2192.7591517054516
they spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them				157.72326928424664
he then endeavored to re enter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the arabian fisherman				38354.510674813086
you have seen the count you say i have only just left him and has he conformed to all that the letter specified he has do you understand it not in the least there is a dupe somewhere at all events it is neither you nor i certainly not well then why it does not much concern us do you think it does no i agree with you there				485.7512209876534
stay there said aramis i shall return immediately the two friends went toward the shed				22262.187995960638
addresses to the duke of orleans and to condé were suggested				36491.58759410287
0311m edmond preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island but as la jeune amélie had merely come to monte cristo to fetch him away he embarked that same evening and proceeded with the captain to leghorn				6762.442907402518
an instant after they were on the deck				3101.163558301895
but i repeat to you i am charged with reclaiming it and if you do not give it up well he has then charged me to take it from you how				2888.4969354155855
do they know him asked château renaud				890.2284872668085
good bye count morcerf took his hat and left the room				219.32767092370813
a most active search was still prosecuted in the house near the hotel de la chevrette for the discovery of planchet				662.295797575785
madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawing room a visitor inquired valentine much agitated who is it some grand personage a prince i believe they said the count of monte cristo i will come directly cried valentine aloud				2588.8763663111827
bonacieux placing her hand upon her bosom my heart beats so i can not walk courage courage				1617.368179701346
is it not a curious affair so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure m de morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to one s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them beauchamp was thunderstruck				17874.119097391
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a calotte was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio				40363.39376815871
the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed only i took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for i had no doubt i was watched				7011.350708275917
really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream				1101.4787083455499
at eight o clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition				20898.75602343083
and yet i have punished her i have dared to tell her i have repent and die but no she must not die she shall live and with me				126.05755475479951
so once more good night caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold				3906.1016811077916
albert left the cab in which he had come at the count s door intending to take a turn on foot				2199.0857098898464
the evening came on and with it darkness but however profound was this darkness my eyes began to accustom themselves to it				88.82821619924832
go monsieur duke and return often				40848.53309864715
look well at that man it is he who raised your father s head on the point of a spear it is he who sold us it is he who forsook us				454.03382146907535
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me				126.08454655202124
and you asked porthos haven t you still in your service your old lackey that good that brave that intelligent what then is his name planchet yes i have found him again but he is lackey no longer what is he then with his sixteen hundred francs you remember the sixteen hundred francs he earned at the siege of la rochelle by carrying a letter to lord de winter he has set up a little shop in the rue des lombards and is now a confectioner ah he is a confectioner in the rue des lombards				35636.47168439468
look at it aramis the roll call finished the president ordered them to read the act of accusation				3244.3306763202004
besides he had long known the prince whilst raoul now saw him for the first time				473.85802208547665
after the reward of his devotion that of his love was to come				1006.4879174105686
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love				978.2488856944072
franz and albert made some difficulty alleging their fear of depriving him of it but the count replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the box at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it				88.82656430743515
oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad sign to find the door open				1289.560118863717
every article of dress hat coat gloves and boots was from the first makers				32402.723996640776
d artagnan slipped out of the cathedral and placed himself in ambuscade at the corner of the rue des canettes it was impossible that bazin should go out of the cathedral without his seeing him				50.33836209054904
i can never forgive myself monsieur said louis xviii i command you to speak well sire the usurper left elba on the 26th february and landed on the 1st of march and where				3973.7597131203497
holloa monsieur d artagnan said he is not that you whom i see yonder d artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy				755.7126627311056
take these said beauchamp presenting the papers to albert				434.03818537005856
yes that is my name you said then by the word of bonacieux				3004.911016938884
because he left no commentaries replied la ramee with his coarse laugh				2733.816933394394
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent				7756.011412896172
the space was cleared the two lamps placed on cromwell s desk in order that the combatants might have as much light as possible and the swords crossed				7940.992517110075
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to him				50.33831408416887
after some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him				50.33925021684014
renée regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome features lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover				4692.076187504983
they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from acting				31296.72593403615
in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé dantès spoke no more of escape				1432.1355445697163
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerf s when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort				302.98538162043553
we are cousins it appears monsieur porthos said the procurator rising yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair				1143.330031011053
in that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in france at the convent of the carmelites at béthune				5711.854735669493
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany but instead of that you come to paris how does that annoy you it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose so said andrea you are speculating upon me what fine words he uses i warn you master caderousse that you are mistaken well well don t be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous				21344.81289730015
then have a care i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my reason for i should hope that i could again behold valentine the count smiled				559.2727438715489
i know a man who will find the means of taking me from paris a man i have too long forgotten then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy ungrateful woman that i am for twenty years i have forgotten this man whom i ought to have made a marechal of france				587.9633632263674
extremely replied he she looked so pale this morning i scarcely knew her these apparently simple words pierced morrel to the heart				360.67838465205443
and you did not tell him that you came from me no sir at ten o clock athos with his habitual exactitude was waiting on the pont du louvre and was almost immediately joined by lord de winter				673.7556113441138
he was beginning to ask full explanation of that breaking in on his sleep which was very annoying to him when d artagnan instead of explaining closed his mouth with his hand				231.95352256430365
seek not to console me alas nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow the wound is too deep and too fresh				6903.400279987974
his eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first story				2663.195228676468
he found beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him beauchamp stopped				2091.607225720407
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise				1590.863398133179
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant true said m d avrigny we will return the doctor went out first followed by m de villefort				302.9855260951583
i do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions				37253.786908559705
the crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be tumultuous				24867.260378429455
d artagnan sick of the closeness of paris thought that when a man had three names of his different estates joined one to another he ought to be very happy in such a paradise then he shook his head saying if i were porthos and d artagnan came to make me such a proposition as i am going to make to him i know what i should say to it as to planchet he thought of little or nothing but was happy as a hunting hound in his old master s company				3086.5025060100456
mazarin leaned out of the window				535.2839408014324
and he is in paris continued he addressing raoul then turning to the queen we may still hope				1245.4694891387403
listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him one takes away from him all claim to good sense another robs him of his poetry a third of his originality another of his humor another of his independence of character a sixth but good heavens				5202.9005648432085
for the last time where are you going to the devil answered d artagnan				80.1235801177404
in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them ah ha ha laughed the three friends not a bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him				50.3382780794138
i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard monseigneur said m de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen				29166.582118750437
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground				1793.3819653785233
i do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody else athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of assent				2043.930848562049
but he was soon aroused from these reflections by lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might				7349.640595977749
he will explain to you the steps that i expect you to pursue				39940.27359726665
the sides of the walls seem to close in even to press against him				50.346655879847596
therefore in spite of all my protestations if it be as i suspect my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his eminence in horror it however proved otherwise				5545.895423254329
here it is i see at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raoul s horse waving his parti colored cap and crying broussel				3832.7798736043255
the sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it				88.82758085260778
m and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfather s presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid				5913.289202746666
he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him				50.37633747092394
she would have taken d artagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache				13515.518444722042
like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection				12978.201490362962
sdeath cried he to the coachman				3305.799433139766
come come cried d artagnan we must finish with this and in his turn he pressed mordaunt hard who continued to lose ground but evidently on purpose and without letting his sword leave the line for a moment				574.0986943622644
but what have you done asked franz				604.9083630894247
you know i hate moralizing except when it is done by athos				152.86801026471696
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course				2905.884292948405
m villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m de villefort				302.98538162043553
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about her you are right said d artagnan i will have done with her				164.27431853677658
it is incredible how these biscuit soak up wine				1190.753041741255
nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that i could wish				2143.9585791455393
what chance brings you here gentlemen said château renaud shaking hands with each of them				157.71838081949656
he applied his imitative powers to everything and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees				2846.827281801
stay a moment your excellency said peppino rising you still owe me something i said they would skin me thought danglars but resolving to resist the extortion he said come how much do i owe you for this fowl your excellency has given me a louis on account a louis on account for a fowl certainly and your excellency now owes me 4 999 louis danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke				30346.268750871273
the following day about three o clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count				288.84748056566843
her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes so you are free now and rich alas groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year				1820.361089348248
i want a letter that will enable me to reach the king s presence without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious time but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the right of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any hour of the day or night doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my discovery with him				50.3382780794138
dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress got in by his side				823.4881313899531
tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning he has given				3037.054405808477
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long				1999.51197396397
france is large the nearest frontier is sixty leagues distant and who is to pursue him cried mazarin				778.4730148735543
and then he a wanderer on the earth a man without fortune a man without family a soldier accustomed to inns cabarets taverns and restaurants a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats was about to partake of family meals to enjoy the pleasures of a comfortable establishment and to give himself up to those little attentions which the harder one is the more they please as old soldiers say				954.3519139374954
know that monsieur de bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop his manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was				868.4833620126782
while retracing the past i forget the present and traversing at will the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a prisoner but the ink said dantès of what did you make your ink there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied faria but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this prison				867.8226697278769

wait he unfolded the paper presented it to the sergeant with one hand and with the other took a pistol from his holsters and cocked it				88.82719964680476

where are you going asked dantès				542.4566887649828
the three gentlemen took the road to picardy a road so well known to them and which recalled to athos and aramis some of the most picturesque adventures of their youth				7281.159681509991
the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered hand				231.959163439878
so d artagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply				1028.4829483922745

milady de boulogne evening of the twenty fifth				34080.658076979424
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante chamber				720.0848614182898

pardieu said d artagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted pardieu it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend s house				465.2869997436822

in all well organized brains the predominating idea and there always is one is sure to be the last thought before sleeping and the first upon waking in the morning				871.0929501459249
when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say he s a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master				1849.2445125543313
why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal well you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you i have my full power show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either today or tomorrow and that i am to follow the person who presents himself in your name very well don t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess to what purpose i am a victim of the cardinal				410.1122303483416
we have said that at half past twelve o clock madame danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage				673.374369725757

milady tried to raise and carry her but could not do it				88.85206616300134
i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene				3456.5012646283762
the invalid s eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable				35925.63239835939
how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason				5230.901060075026
monte cristo opened the carriage door morrel sprang out on the pavement bertuccio was waiting on the steps				1524.0729717427896
as to athos faithful to his system of reticence he contented himself with interrogating d artagnan by a look				945.4006001828518
he had made up his mind to write to her the next day				483.1422882906555
gentlemen said he let us drink to him who presides at the repast				4396.135507088123
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs				1250.7627287488478

for my part i should not hesitate a moment i should take the hundred pistoles				1174.916735220053
this contest at length exhausted jussac s patience				43132.0606368527
d artagnan was conqueror without much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for form s sake				35996.21150146326
we have a king ten years old who doesn t yet know what he wants we have a queen blinded by a belated passion we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farm that is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from mazarin s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes				38725.87823587653
i tried to pray but my tongue was frozen				16996.305340043196

no count i hope i assure you i shall do my best stammered villefort				303.00662014397193
none for a moment dantès was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by cardinal spada				22057.618807323193
never i could not to me to a brother said felton				681.2027445151207
speak sir and pray begin at the beginning i like order in everything sire said villefort i will render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language a glance at the king after this discreet and subtle exordium assured villefort of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my duties not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every day got up in the lower ranks of the people and in the army but an actual conspiracy a storm which menaces no less than your majesty s throne				4932.311036335221
i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self examination let us drop the subject and adopt the middle course of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement				9939.332098318631
meantime d artagnan who is full of invention would find some way to save the king				425.02332535139556
yes at present continued lord de winter you will remain in this castle				2426.054626714646
in fact at one of the doors which opened into the queen s apartment appeared the pretty mme				194.55515838078358
dantès remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire				13696.749047330217
are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god				569.4851809461773

the eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red light of the fire made them look like demons				15511.261013029865
give him some more wine fernand fernand filled caderousse s glass who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his hand from the paper and seized the glass				1119.8834331036
on the evening before they had scarcely seen each other for a moment at the apartment of the swiss guard germain whither d artagnan had sent for her				164.27463186547226
the poor duke swore fell into a rage yelled and declared that they wished to starve him to death as they had starved the marechal ornano and the grand prior of vendome but he refused to promise that he would not make any more drawings and remained without any fire in the room all the winter				673.7556113441138
these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been				3336.4011673613545
not so bad yet replied athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of france d artagnan breathed again				391.9735124680595

to him who is called the comte de la fere it is i said athos and what is the name of the person grimaud ah exclaimed athos turning pale				675.799100663306
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion				1726.3867098741853
you are welcome gentlemen she said				498.21272546474705
well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to france with us friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable then you have some other motive unknown to us athos smiled and d artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head				426.9290058744706
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation				13440.133120118739
the count laid his hand on franz s shoulder				1457.2946899328053
if you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left shoulder well now that will do wonderfully well said athos				152.84519641204625

a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlord s hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m franz d épinay				2837.430107721208
0073m how can i tell you replied he i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and can not in the least make out what it is about caderousse then looked around for fernand but he had disappeared				585.3338505956872
your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable				7946.393988315745
i parted from him two years ago at palermo and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions so that i fear he will never return oh monsieur this is cruel of you said julie much affected and the young lady s eyes swam with tears				1908.7484289360523
no no cried bertuccio setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall				855.5815931744988
you chevalier d herblay to his left				1348.679875670791
it was then that the door of edward s room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared				7097.347937483839
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin rueil d they went to rueil cried aramis				151.46935965629007
the soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone				1996.9183894450603
with what my father said just now he returned a sign in the negative				6869.7482259126255
having obtained the light he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps				4378.746037960081
who i cried milady i a protestant				23600.31888337163
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse				507.53932900578206
at the moment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio				32532.057599575783
give me your hand and let us go to the minister and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle his majesty will then take refuge in holland where i hear his highness the prince of wales now is and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight alas				2084.940574049135
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage				673.4109749716471
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baron s right hand with his left and held out his other hand				231.95352256430365
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me and you you would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis				151.4689262995959
on his account i add two hundred crowns scoundrel muttered d artagnan				80.1338199532794
where do your excellencies wish to go asked he				208.88433182880067
at this moment planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont				41349.59734370915
and the cry issued from his pores if we may thus speak a cry frightful in its silence				714.0380148455873
you are safe you are free mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a miracle				11652.249693847269
d artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he lowered his head and entered the inn without reply				1028.4849100696906
how did you obtain these details sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a man of marseilles whom i have watched for some time and arrested on the day of my departure				2319.559632832477
the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day				483.1141827242896
i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them				157.7291356419502
it was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the duke of buckingham it was you who had madame bonacieux carried off it was you who in love with de wardes and thinking to pass the night with him opened the door to monsieur d artagnan it was you who believing that de wardes had deceived you wished to have him killed by his rival it was you who when this rival had discovered your infamous secret wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins whom you sent in pursuit of him it was you who finding the balls had missed their mark sent poisoned wine with a forged letter to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends				429.70458192216194
on arriving at the rue saint denis the friends found a vast concourse of people				1043.3345830615965
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme				194.5488500462969
it is quite immaterial to me said monte cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle				12312.159008208326
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no chance of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar one conducting to another room				219.26032943629752
he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him				50.33982630713702
what do you say to this mother and albert took out of a little pocket book with golden clasps a remnant of his old fancies or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door albert took out of this pocket book a note of 1 000 francs				741.7262047910266
an effort was made and the living barrier was violently broken through				2989.6955141807
alone in the world i had but my son and he has left me he possesses a noble heart madame replied the count and he has acted rightly				9678.053926271114
and you think that your wife has returned to the louvre without speaking to anyone but yourself i am sure of it that is an important point do you understand then the news i brought you is of value the greatest my dear bonacieux i don t conceal this from you then the cardinal will be pleased with me i have no doubt of it the great cardinal are you sure in her conversation with you that your wife mentioned no names i think not she did not name madame de chevreuse the duke of buckingham or madame de vernet no she only told me she wished to send me to london to serve the interests of an illustrious personage the traitor murmured mme				194.54755129694092
i must know so that i may assist you if there is any chance i know nothing about it continued aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him tell the king that to morrow at ten o clock at night we shall carry him off he has said it and will do it tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not d artagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made his untimely entrance you are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them now sire resumed aramis listen to me				126.05719410175836
albert she asked did you notice that what mother that the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of m de morcerf yes but then he breakfasted with me indeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion but your house is not m de morcerf s murmured mercédès and since he has been here i have watched him well well he has taken nothing yet the count is very temperate mercédès smiled sadly				8631.736241915121
remember i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers				16029.592893684716
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for d artagnan s embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that i know you with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent king you my dear porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as d artagnan porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right athos arose				5793.040130436839
his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiority in fact the application of the axiom pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others				1416.8356380873413
a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two arms extended right and left and formed a carriage drive from the iron gates to a double portico on every step of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers				1935.926408911143
the next morning however just as he removed his bed from the wall he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees				1349.1172550388126
but will you be able to follow me oh yes your wound gives me pain but will not prevent my walking be ready then at the first signal milady shut the window extinguished the lamp and went as felton had desired her to lie down on the bed				692.0271353944912
all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber				720.0893251539717
athos had even gone so far as to question m de tréville a thing which considering the habitual reticence of the worthy musketeer had very much astonished his captain				1721.8880019793917
i don t know what devil of an insect stung me and made me ambitious				26974.26726030485
at the door he stopped to listen				5010.7385971213025
at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door				212.24522111321215
the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated				22055.914974585005
some of that at the bottom near the laths				35262.0283986322
if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle				2425.940102951431
if i thought one of you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency i would blow his brains out with my own hand 20211m well said the count turning towards franz i told you there was some mistake in this are you not alone asked vampa with uneasiness				1665.630045294812
d artagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m de tréville who detected him at once				2015.0502079644773
the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man				179.06364111397488
i believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband but monsieur you know then i know that you have been abducted madame and by whom				25126.434046616967
i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops that s well said monte cristo i remain here a day or two arrange accordingly as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter				11286.178495659386
bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed				3828.816006994394
come with me my friend said the englishman i wish to speak to you chapter 30				13019.979002363349
for the rest this vengeance was very easy for milady doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover had ordered kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment and even in the little chamber itself				1888.6647082043821
bassompierre and schomberg from deserting the army a separate command had to be given to each				11620.677620106122
oh my king and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation				33940.66840022172
athos played and that as a rule unfortunately				27800.043218757426
bonacieux remained standing mute motionless and pale as a statue				2134.567736228895
our family although still rich for my father s income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence				2212.236642986841
ah sir replied raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life this is terrible said athos				152.8451235297945
at daybreak the telegraphs were set at work in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of caderousse				528.750855984908
my faith replied d artagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward d artagnan stood quite astonished				2522.890130156495
you are a generous man albert but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a right to offer you i will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life of your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your father to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair albert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide after she had finished reading this letter				592.0198433552512
thanks said the poor abbé shivering as though his veins were filled with ice				8241.551809595856
there are only two persons who have the key to that door murmured morrel cocles and julie at this instant the second door opened and the young girl her eyes bathed with tears appeared				1102.831470016333
ah i am an unfortunate king monsieur de tréville				1860.723846361696
besides sir said villefort addressing himself to his future son in law excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes this unexpected will need not personally wound you m noirtier s weakness of mind sufficiently explains it				88.82660666325174
at last their hilarity calmed down and faith exclaimed d artagnan to the two friends you may well wish ill to mazarin for i assure you on his side he wishes you no good pooh				5888.438189974179
is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarch s life of alexander				33786.84759751421
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain clear				16991.281311367547
we have learnt nothing forgotten nothing				713.9549425930225
he aimed a terrible blow at d artagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bastion				3958.697853955264
this knife was my only hope				1247.6914151109056
i present to you he said monsieur le chevalier d artagnan lieutenant of his majesty s musketeers a devoted friend and one of the most excellent brave gentlemen that i have ever known d artagnan received the compliments of those who were present in his own way and whilst the conversation became general he looked earnestly at athos				152.84483200113513
the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged				29829.217258426834
we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as d artagnan says will carry the letter well said cried aramis you don t often speak athos but when you do speak it is like st john of the golden mouth				2594.610659769533
22 literally the basket because wedding gifts were originally brought in such a receptacle				27821.52638694946
you must set out for boulogne				2462.9296297990295
now the successor of pere marteau had promised him a pate of pheasant instead of a pate of fowl and chambertin wine instead of macon				27974.00144551302
nothing at least personally said monte cristo				202.66626893378086
yes i and why you because i alone know what that he is far from being or rather having been so guilty toward you as he appears indeed said milady in an anxious tone explain yourself for i really can not tell what you mean and she looked at d artagnan who embraced her tenderly with eyes which seemed to burn themselves away				594.8438822488977
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting				2380.613681055423
each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy				2734.07505550786
those lips were magnificent they might be said to be of coral				24078.44274992664
at one moment bathed as they were in a flood of brilliant light which illumined the sea for the space of a league they might each be seen each by his own peculiar attitude and manner expressing the awe which even in their hearts of bronze they could not help experiencing				28844.023382324
come you are accounted for you are here but where are your friends i do not know my lord				696.2817785755269
i will expose all to whom to m danglars by heaven cried caderousse drawing from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the count in the breast you shall disclose nothing reverend sir to caderousse s great astonishment the knife instead of piercing the count s breast flew back blunted				30231.304050984236
m de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio				32630.742336962026
they sing let them pay the piper				25488.307916403584
which means that i have just been duped sixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour d artagnan and athos laughed aloud				2588.8776007839265
thanks father thanks and feeling in his pocket he took thence a small pocket book which contained ten bank notes each of 1 000 francs				741.7290342573485
m coquenard was served first then porthos				145.4781996959065
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement				3956.9464983455914
this scene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the accused count				288.88122717374335
you know something about him do you not madame				1009.6999296530281
i have imparted it to no one but my god and that in my prayers i ask for no more				1128.3756643487084
and now your excellency he added bowing his head you know everything you are my judge on earth as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no words of consolation my good friend i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the abbé busoni				6772.679027290779

you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you				95.69703036450007
would you not be happy to begin anew in my society and in that of porthos the exploits of our youth do you propose to me to do so d artagnan decidedly and honestly on whose side asked athos fixing his clear benevolent glance on the countenance of the gascon				1862.9824112052486
will you not even say you will see me again he asked				859.8826127930108
gracious me said porthos there s phoebus ruined the cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles i m above that let us set out again at full gallop yes if we can but at last the lieutenant s horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall				1751.116730401539
d artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding				17295.351000069204
my brother in law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before but in vain				1188.5645011653364
i do not seek your confidence my dear friend				526.4526751625825
i neglected it and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me constance disappeared				585.3430612628421
i was trying on my wedding suit				13915.015678028041
excuse me excuse you for what				672.2117446835252
he was silent for an instant and during that time he scanned the young man even more attentively than he had done at first				1026.542232525767
ah captain said the officer everything is quiet hereabout if i did not know that something is going on in yonder house and he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon the vaudeville now stands				5009.424650932651
i married exclaimed monte cristo shuddering who could have told you so no one told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely woman she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople madame the daughter of a prince				1270.8047299191428
but there he is in the hands of justice and added he with a smile she will take her own so saying he leaped into a boat desiring to be rowed on board the pharaon where m morrel had agreed to meet him				50.33829008099596
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention				886.0756155873412
you are of so superior a mind nothing escapes you why do you say so because for instance you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave that m de monte cristo would eat nothing in our house mercédès raised herself on her feverish arm				830.6174993189784
who could ever have believed it a moment afterwards julie saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of money				609.3684749071454
the count of monte cristo she murmured				4679.304871698463
you may therefore comprehend that being of no country asking no protection from any government acknowledging no man as my brother not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests me				126.05719410175836
well they fastened a thirty six pound ball to his feet and threw him into the sea really exclaimed the englishman				2182.3177443628315
rather place faith in what i tell you				95.85664682215732
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the interest they had felt for the count s safety became now quite a secondary matter				894.7194626390584
she wouldn t believe me saying that she knew anne of austria who was too proud to love such a worthless coxcomb				29698.50440705124
the bell and bottle tavern and now let us leave mademoiselle danglars and her friend pursuing their way to brussels and return to poor andrea cavalcanti so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune				1182.1785572059587
oh it is impossible to doubt it cried he suddenly				11552.566455464674
no only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the napkins the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne				6443.543940874889
i have known him for ten years the last four of which he was in my service				1104.888489990805
have you any other guests in your house inquired he				208.83025396062123
haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear				1573.2052242447785
this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure				2373.209186845982
i had an affianced husband a man whom i loved and who loved me a heart like yours felton a man like you				95.69794300685203
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then i can continue my work in safety				4098.555578024767
then d artagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knows d artagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant				11150.510605649093
oh curses woe death to you he tried to follow monte cristo but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spot his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living fire				2491.3464222275506
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newton s system				14423.18767026849
several times even i felt a smile on my lips				448.48447323717056
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door				212.25736622965275
silence but you promised me whispered the poor mercer				11305.07319009132
my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body				892.1428883114719
at this moment a ray of light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor				3734.4973110068754
no my daughter is not guilty				2898.9975535712397

no it will all go well m d épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m d épinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation				30533.42263095626

we shall meet again master d artagnan continued the leader raising his voice				412.85229332546226
although our friends were expecting that condemnation it filled them with grief				1097.5052050085972

it had taken but two minutes for the king to reach the tent of the scottish commander he dismounted and entered				726.9870557342886
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window				533.403810324545
yes sir who is it a woman accompanied by a servant everyone looked at his neighbor				8218.108124552109
in order to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his wife s and daughter s jewels and a portion of his plate				6344.6866976640185

whereupon grimaud observing the duke s disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him				50.339490253662625
she believed the order ready for execution				3066.6332307370685
you know he has estates porthos i should think so indeed				896.9428583666177

a few moments passed a great noise was heard at the gate				1067.8657208822194
d artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting yes count nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since then said athos in a tone of delight he is well				642.6657815628071
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and that s a comfort can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition i don t know him but as you spoke to him you must have seen him oh it s a description you want exactly so a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman that s the man cried d artagnan again he forever he				208.75478745701335
yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my arthur thou art a fond and faithful creature after this little scene charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to athos aramis and winter said now gentlemen i am at your service but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp				2462.4716500022414
for two reasons what ones the first is that my mistress will never love you how do you know that you have cut her to the heart i				668.1341288065815

seven o clock said grimaud who had not spoken a word				527.2990823155833
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement				9939.341577208896
we can find no fault with you for watching over yourselves when you watch so carefully over others				1416.8200993753258
there is nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter that is easily done said aramis				151.47260987101657
he was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which ornano puylaurens and his uncle had died				8300.72713273648
on this paved yard are to be seen pacing to and fro from morning till night pale careworn and haggard like so many shadows the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharpening				20498.72057237517
they entered the common hall and placed themselves at table				750.236871009741
m de tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were dead				624.8621056384229
has he by any possibility gone to change his face which was too like that of monsieur de mazarin				778.4726436687827
her skin was admired for its velvety softness her hands and arms were of surpassing beauty all the poets of the time singing them as incomparable				22438.996540142383
no not that way i beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the hall				12310.09262662151
well dantès you do not thank me this treasure belongs to you my dear friend replied dantès and to you only				5330.821757420852
in the first one handy provided it is safe said the commissary with an indifference which penetrated poor bonacieux with horror				3702.351517679258
you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond said to bear the name repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager				35463.566011640774
the next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability				29673.505989157904
at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star				11744.053813650979
his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy				34072.59857172177
in returning with the comte de la fere and monsieur d herblay our crime would be confirmed				24332.99176149448
come gentlemen come and albert followed by franz and the count descended the staircase crossed the square chamber where stood all the bandits hat in hand				231.9544073984596
then the postscript well what of the postscript then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter certainly the abbé busoni and myself have a small account open between us				454.03382146907535
i am on the point of starting on a journey replied morrel disdainfully				9865.934544083742
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried				27889.931983305905
after giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me i have also sent for the procureur he will not come in time i feel my life fast ebbing wait a moment said monte cristo				202.1432592490653
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st peter s franz silently assented and the following afternoon at half past five o clock the young men parted				14738.170347742518
one only is still not in our power and braves us				454.10397295184987
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise				28251.971827017445
if he should really be guilty said he and did really put in to the island of elba if he is really charged with a letter for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this letter upon him those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices i confess i had my fears in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue				5533.1847302982615
parry closed the door and approaching the king his face radiant with joy sire he said in a low voice do you know who these workmen are who are making so much noise i				668.1338102154782
if he tells the baron said she i am lost for the baron who knows very well that i shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but acted she placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more beautiful				6151.874433020162
you wished it to be preceded by all these titles it is quite wonderful mr president how entirely you have read my thoughts said benedetto in his softest voice and most polite manner				804.0189825429671
still young for he was scarcely forty six years of age he possessed great elegance of form and was above the middle height his complexion was brilliant and beautiful his glance full of expression his nose though large was well proportioned his forehead broad and majestic his hair of a chestnut color was curled slightly his beard which was darker than his hair was turned carefully with a curling iron a practice that greatly improved it				88.82652195163874
it is only the dead who do not return you think so porthos replied the musketeer with a sad smile which d artagnan alone understood				4338.637623590224
yes continued morrel death had entered that house twice within one month and what did the doctor answer asked monte cristo				202.14644012486235
whatever may ensue i will go if you are determined said athos do so but the bastille said aramis				151.4735488349217
when i need your assistance and the moment arrives i will come to you count well i rely upon your promise				13458.705694931941
the king and the cardinal are the best of friends their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools				12152.864320663448
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward				11075.02162948794
the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel				3447.1357845124776
ah exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says himself alas yes murmured de winter				673.7588240688839
and can not women be dishonored by appearances				25153.598158205245
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary d artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach				12389.911038526529
the days of expectation are long and d artagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were forty four hours				2460.053989765272
oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him				50.33830208258099
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abbé				797.9557055996105
ah monsieur hypocrite i understand how you study theology the three blows were scarcely struck when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter				22453.767050701434
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge				7492.912669608157
during the daytime valentine s perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter s room and watched her with his paternal tenderness villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child				828.2748906062595
now young man regulate your conduct accordingly and if you entertain whether from your family your relations or even from your instincts any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal bid me adieu and let us separate				11685.746226040317
they were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children				18872.603775553234
madame de villefort had no longer any doubt all was over she had consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish				27455.182067575955
the usual guide from the hotel having followed them they had paid two conductors nor is it possible at rome to avoid this abundant supply of guides besides the ordinary cicerone who seizes upon you directly you set foot in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument nay almost to each part of a monument				33651.2417665814
it is my father who has just left his study to accompany the doctor to the door added morrel				434.33466122588806
it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail				9952.858184635548
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance				1217.6129666642146
the cemetery of père lachaise m de boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking valentine to her last home on earth				2400.5770663890316
you understand no more delay yes sir i will give my attention to the subject i do not say that i await with pleasure his decision but i do await it				88.82677608672009
of how much does he rob you every year on my word replied the count not more than another				581.1034071739277
as for me i can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world i am quite sure i shall recognize selim				5052.234922481721
i saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses i heard my glass removed the same which is there now on the table oh dear mother it was a dream so little was it a dream that i stretched my hand towards the bell but when i did so the shade disappeared my maid then entered with a light but she saw no one phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them				157.7055211204376
at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly				23005.256495571386
you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host good night and mounted the stairs				1250.7615359291262
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty is what you tell me true asked the wounded man				179.04366232633382
he took his seat amongst them they played and i won				28816.39128302808
dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern				4964.855465257741
my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other s failings				29767.550321793784
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct				10666.815082558727
it is my fault madame said raoul				842.0214689432802
why replied dantès i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this paper silence exclaimed dantès				540.5959581896118
in addition to this after a half hour s conversation d artagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head				426.9290058744706
it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the banker s as the betrothed				2849.3193349222825
well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from madame de morcerf s i will await her return and beg her to come up here				688.995958306576
go out by the door turn to the right jump into your saddles all will be right don t be uneasy at anything except mistaking the signal				7899.0426015249495
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface				25459.106987711297
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly				26678.879527876787
can i be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for the voice became more and more indistinct a tumultuous movement shook the partition				17128.51453337536
i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the hôtel and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage				21529.667715408763
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to d artagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed				692.0271353944912

the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne				4932.311036335221

well said morcerf for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppæa while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl				991.2065319424139
thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a churchman				7277.473427954731
grimaud was reluctant to leave the man alone and yet he perceived the necessity of starting at once to bear these tidings to the comte de la fere				2830.2278161197414
it yet stood under the shade of the fine avenue of lime trees which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles covered by an immense vine which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south				12777.249015456868
and we did not surrender no				414.95916689906556

you must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest care d artagnan took the letter touched his hat with his hand turned round upon his heel like a drill sergeant and a moment afterward was heard in his dry and monotonous tone commanding four men and an escort a carriage and a horse five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard				3624.946424015613
yes without accident perfectly safe and sound porthos whilst i get up watch the cardinal				410.1247461713466
here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils				29210.730754884804
d artagnan who foreseeing such an event had kept his eye on him sprang toward him caught him in his arms and assisted him to his chamber				720.0882950586662
i see it in the depths of the inner cavern				4963.217475638304

you may call on the notary m deschamps place beauveau faubourg saint honoré and you have my authority to inspect those deeds sir replied m d épinay it is not perhaps the moment for mademoiselle valentine who is in deep distress to think of a husband indeed i fear 40028m valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her grandmother s last injunctions there will be no obstacle from that quarter i assure you in that case replied franz as i shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please i have pledged my word and shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it then said villefort nothing further is required				21888.67859489749
with the eagle glance of a sailor he had recognized there where another would have seen only a gull hovering over the waves the sail of a sloop which was directed toward the coast of france				587.9636435892135
the musketeers rode the whole length of the faubourg saint antoine and of the road to vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a village				4295.64262686114
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding				21643.593780164483
and sir where does he reside pray the comte de la fere lodges in the rue guenegaud hotel du grand roi charlemagne thanks sir				538.6671167426647

their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right				1369.6794327277776
he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him				50.39991990434039

the cabman joyfully pocketed the sum and turned back on his road to paris				458.2636823533604
sire murmured lord leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity i ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the enemy that can not be sire said the earl				45793.758163359504
alas said d avrigny she is indeed dead poor child 50099m yes answered the doctor laconically dropping the sheet he had raised				12804.20700270456
the young man turned quickly round for this attack could not have come from the bastion which was hidden by the angle of the trench				16909.356825386712
d artagnan s plan was very simple				12339.736085007948
i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and i will take m ali as my model by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities				5333.837343643682
on the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention				27118.68488930262
ah the young rascal stealing in a garden he does not know where that may lead him to certainly it is wrong said monte cristo but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent of course said the gardener but that does not make it the less unpleasant				33030.279403013876
are you going to rejoin your cardinal				410.7108749468033
they could hear the two soldiers shivering with fear as they lay bound in the chamber				720.0831446042415
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m andrea cavalcanti				1280.7791036021615
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money the host became as pale as death for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master				1849.2515668757717
now while admiring as others doubtless will admire the details we have to relate our main preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had given a thought				1955.942760003634
which was the real delinquent both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post and where was this letter written at la réserve the day before the betrothal feast twas so then twas so then murmured the abbé				797.9214617906155
quick as a flash he raised her in his arms and placed her in a chair				1143.3311213760587
have you then power against death				783.2008730463057
what did you say sir asked the man				179.24201210046263
monsieur d artagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns				11884.517609253855
he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house				465.2869997436822
the occupant of the box in which the greek girl sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his seat to stand up in front so that his countenance being fully revealed franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of monte cristo and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening in the ruins of the colosseum and whose voice and figure had seemed so familiar to him				50.3382780794138
light the candles in my apartment if you please the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light				1757.9209505273732
bonacieux when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone that imbecile lacked but one thing to become a cardinalist				12240.496877890902

is m de saint méran with you m				666.7401556371218
the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited				7831.654202604646
aha what blood at this word the three friends leaped from their horses and entered				726.9991887409938
athos went in quest of the englishman whom he found in the stable examining the harnesses with a greedy eye				2053.8207991679965
do not dig any more said the voice only tell me how high up is your excavation on a level with the floor how is it concealed behind my bed has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner no what does your chamber open on a corridor and the corridor on a court alas murmured the voice				412.82748929299856
the trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped				2981.907654546731
tomorrow said he you will be avenged or i shall be dead no said she you will avenge me but you will not be dead				624.8647872614135
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information you think resumed mazarin that rochefort he was cardinal richelieu s creature my lord				696.2814465625814
at this moment a horse neighed				36414.480356086504
grimaud turned round with a jerk recognized me and pointed to the man in the mask				3483.3684256722986
how is there still time asked the man in the cloak				2791.9962991629986
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again				391.98659621392113
this i ask of you in the name of the interest with which i inspire you in the name of the service you have rendered me and which i never shall forget while i have life				469.16867536439395
he pointed his finger to the lighted window				533.8470664453306
you know bragelonne said athos i never speak without reflection well comte i am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the prince de marsillac who is happily in paris just now				1201.9317043121114
how ought she really to be supremely loved				3075.5954836054025
at five o clock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered béthune				5711.538803955849
then d artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church and how he had found that lady who with the seigneur in the black cloak and with the scar near his temple filled his mind constantly				27861.16788575558
it was you who rode off at the moment i had that unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of yes it was i so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to expect if you do not tell me the whole truth condescend to listen to me and you shall know all i listen i had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad money would arrive at my inn with several of his companions all disguised as guards or musketeers				844.8197951372541
why they want to know if the duke of buckingham is in paris and if he has had or is likely to have an interview with the queen d artagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in probability				34805.90792918392
all looked around athos himself stared				29886.56529475848
but we were not captured by fair means and before we had time to draw our swords two of our party were dead and athos grievously wounded was very little better				1072.6276338343507
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp				27783.74300420588
not a thought was given to a life which you once mercédès had the power to render blissful not one hour of peaceful calm was mine but i felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel				16134.697864613776
however the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it and he endeavored to draw back a step or two but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut the obstacle compelled him to keep his place				1078.9361550216267
i am brave when i set about it				88.97637591910308
but how can you continue to receive us asked the coadjutor if your income is lessened i shall be obliged to make you a canon of notre dame oh no cried scarron i should compromise you too much perhaps you have resources of which we are ignorant i shall borrow from the queen but her majesty has no property interposed aramis				151.46885407360074
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of that is true said porthos echoing d artagnan s sigh				1081.7117202520815
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me fortune has been kind to you then				889.0220444966063
morrel attributed penelon s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the pharaon longer				3296.7259533990127
i implored heaven that he might come				1006.363622998837
m bonacieux was at his door				213.66542437219022
arriving at the window parry found an unfinished scaffold over which they were nailing a covering of black serge				31158.89893690381
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended				29247.02377829141
i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a year before at the precise spot where i stopped to dig the hole				6835.882091384834
believe me madame i had entirely forgotten it but it is not so easy to forget monsieur that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend madame de villefort which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me 30101m this time at least i do not deserve your thanks				13591.948779265571
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm				4691.968795632774
it was a large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already a fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of september				3897.331365962477
it is i who lose my cause and it is ill luck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me to what do you refer said monte cristo with well feigned interest				2549.62447501985
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir				3287.5989943784416
it is then the cardinal s custom to walk in his orangery asked d artagnan				80.12067652193444
i will give it to none but the king monsieur said anne				8608.512520746817
it was the island of tiboulen				13796.001131749072
athos smiled the smile was melancholy				6053.247486128161
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you d artagnan placed his hand upon the queen s diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late				2104.1475244037074
at last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door				212.2471440436764
you are deceived monsieur i know her very well ah said mme				194.58874442806746
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title				5176.69861032964
the two sailors redoubled their efforts and one of them cried in italian courage the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head				426.9290058744706
why did you not have him arrested while in paris arrest the duke				666.1846516897889
and signed by whom by the king and the cardinal pronounced these words with a singular expression of contempt				3745.236381266069
look fernand your eyes are better than mine				1527.7983988114836
and he darted on beside his friend who had already begun a fresh pursuit				16364.324760162672
prorsus admirabile continued aramis but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers				12467.41688480724
and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the father in law i must address myself to the banker and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his turn				1019.47197441498
he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the ground with the pickaxe				33252.786417553565
the duke meanwhile recovered his self control				16407.752011998662
not monsieur d artagnan exclaimed the commissary				7458.897508431062
taste that fowl and those fish				30116.02813455406
and yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens				5202.9005648432085
ah ah cried he seizing my arm and wresting from me the weapon that had so badly served me you want to take my life do you my pretty puritan				4668.166280240929
a mattress was laid upon the deck for him				50.402154981474254
for heaven s sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me				126.0671725498733
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so i know too that you are a good marksman there we are about equal				25744.573769666167
the bastion saint gervais on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends d artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber				720.0869216005509
there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill but in these days landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son				1000.8205923402394
one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were sitting				10289.342656481296
he said nothing but when i went out he followed and quickly came up with me				126.06446747084219
at the end of an instant the poet closed his manuscript upon the cover of which was written mirame a tragedy in five acts and raised his head				426.9294130258926
confided to me it shall never escape my lips say albert my friend do you wish it albert threw himself on beauchamp s neck				8834.96577802692
he led the way toward the hill of saint roche				29621.622990734322
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp				11252.442896277691
when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave				10026.567728324675
why did she not ask from any one of us a home instead of from mazarin				778.474499694411
now they will be far from looking for us among the puritans therefore with the puritans we must go good my friend good said athos				152.8456337062864
one by the post madame danglars footman left the other let madame danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her box				1650.257537219777

thin and lanky the executioner said d artagnan and aramis at the same time				473.8751948332026
it was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it				88.83626431671308
tomorrow is the twenty third and buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet he sets sail tomorrow				1440.3764450724884
the palace of the louvre contains two things the king who must die and royalty which never dies				29999.618196406478
don t be afraid said he smiling				828.6090876092811
what is the matter exclaimed d artagnan anxiously what has happened to you my lord all is lost cried buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse two of the studs are wanting there are only ten can you have lost them my lord or do you think they have been stolen they have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this blow				1893.6199146251652
do you wish to destroy me you see very plainly that there is still danger for you since a single word makes you tremble and you confess that if that word were heard you would be ruined				6088.581775104711
good news shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout				14555.217559389308
it was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate and too late for one from the director of the prison or the doctor it must then be the visitor he hoped for				1173.858910871726
take care for i warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long i rip him up the chieftain of the party drew near				4315.730231198696
the ballet lasted an hour and had sixteen entrées				28853.597686879795
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your excursion prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades				7484.364029232231
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way				676.9963375244197
what was most clear in the matter was that d artagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all				335.6425367031491
certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover monte cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the count s house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved				8482.181613364832
he reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going to fight and began to view his situation more clearly				13465.625657948289
the only question was had she ten or twelve				15345.923040927431
and you did not awaken me i wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child you must be fatigued from yesterday oh sir how good you are athos smiled				559.2727438715489
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping				13082.785272174271
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians d artagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans				3532.488443299953

he turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had brought rose staggered towards it raised the vessel to his lips and drank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure				1281.0857232789788

no i am lost do not be lost with me				126.1197828477372
suddenly two dark forms seemed to separate from the mass advanced grew in size and as they loomed up larger and larger assumed the appearance of two horsemen				6422.764260628028
sleeplessness inflamed my eyes i had not dared to sleep a single instant				1196.9769570686535
this morning i ventured to run along the gutters and well interrupted d artagnan i am delighted that de rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the king s servants they will hang thee without mercy				12058.163484372666
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you				95.69703036450007
athos was scarcely aged at all				337.4002762975818
madame de saint méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to her villefort seized the doctor s hand				231.9537437725262
the name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey				4311.497149256105
well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the lady s agitation revealed tell me what is the matter oh lucien can i confide in you of course you know you can do so				430.4635830704837
the house which was discernible through the trees remained in darkness and gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a marriage contract was going on				528.3367718165589
we and his majesty will lead the second				3968.7832021068994
in case i am killed the captain s name is roger and the skiff is called the lightning				2496.0933011767115
yes monsieur replied the terrified citizen in a tone so low that he was scarcely audible				2907.5017773675104
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open d artagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid				3892.5173883869556
such a thing is really out of rule eccentric or stupid				8798.817930861427
what do you think of it my little fellow said caderousse				528.7954845340453
i spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and i fainted again and now how are you feeling very ill replied the wounded man				179.04263783321124
now the portmanteau let us make haste the portmanteau stop said louise going to listen at madame danglars door				212.25028149394024
wait my dear father said the young man one word more say on however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing what is that the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house oh the admirable police have found that out have they				7549.865665520414
the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire				13696.801296381012
why should we load ourselves with a useless burden i don t find a good musket twelve cartridges and a powder flask very useless in the face of an enemy well replied athos have you not heard what d artagnan said what did he say demanded porthos				145.03864679248733
in fact the evening before a fever had seized him in the midst of the parliament while he was holding his bed of justice				2336.3580567586587
anybody may possess a five franc piece but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me				126.06019957529658
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared				1102.8304182747863
follow him said villefort to dantès				542.3483195821611
among worldly people manner is contagious				39722.42366082502
boisgoli let him send one of his best but not such a one as he made for la ramee				1392.4539998151217
the count was no longer young				7056.940045286227
the door closed and dantès advanced with outstretched hands until he touched the wall he then sat down in the corner until his eyes became accustomed to the darkness				1135.6135105856167
dead bodies are not kept a year they are shown to a magistrate and the evidence is taken				1648.7080639921596
are you satisfied now inquired valentine				686.1206885555199
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held				2881.04275036821
suddenly he heard a cry it was his daughter s voice				412.88320202275963
yes replied she trying to recover her self possession				2384.86867226983
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back				804.3173122832588
in fact the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied the lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil				20902.52324762862
the officer entered for the fourth time				474.77129971579905
nevertheless they had not the power of convincing milady				406.7340928684913
having seen jacopo fairly out of the harbor dantès proceeded to make his final adieus on board la jeune amélie distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him				50.3382780794138
i stumbled over some object i stooped to examine it was the second pistol which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet				27853.941652411788
one of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his companion				1726.3883562856358
the fact was that andrea at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the fire he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney pots				33886.688605270065
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father s mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank				6290.31287677536
and even if she were to be seriously offended i could well understand it your majesty has treated her with a severity it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours duke however high they may be placed and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them the queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable wife				992.2128290630017
laporte place the king in bed laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet				11978.174535649197
now said athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and i will watch in a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to france but the benign aspect of protecting providence				3255.4883441906054
you are stupid replied the cardinal				411.21430185986634
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commenced by the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it				88.82677608672009
then you shall not leave this place said he				208.8829373800986
my dear franz m maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz				603.9025349328417
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses				31899.149444770883
meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment ah				256.50770883815386
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people				1043.3340855610174
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another				581.098696634166
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him				50.33951425740783
alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful crime				5639.89612011592
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages				16287.954931060493
oh it is impossible you must have saved some surer more subtle and deadly poison than any other that you might escape the punishment that you deserve				7035.765575341124
i think the arm will make up for the sword halt cried porthos coming forward				1974.5534930887166
mine host s face does not please me at all it is too gracious nor me either said athos				152.84782019625396
ah my lord he said have you come to drive away those rascal spaniards and those lorraine robbers yes said the prince if you will serve me as guide willingly my lord				696.2814465625814
dost know where porthos is no not at all and aramis not in the least the devil				1439.1818651916717
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity				3363.8710971301243
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting father you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques no				412.689519461115
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps				1524.0758786840609
tell me pardieu it was the most simple thing in the world				822.2556789158735
no sir i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so				430.4635830704837
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were				2612.110313869168
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethe s heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristo s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger				1409.9242732631992
d avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative				14808.911818121083
i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart				360.6754609213533
two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to them				157.71567342729213
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it				88.92178880981857
at the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the palais royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to cardinal mazarin				778.4715300555298
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner and the result of the sitting was that the procurator s wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory				9988.716146172206
i hope he whispered to him that you will follow his majesty s example and not get killed for your folly in this den set your mind at rest replied athos				152.84505064757755
it was the plan of alexander vi				14553.9128097799
as we had no doctor on board and he was so anxious to arrive at elba that he would not touch at any other port his disorder rose to such a height that at the end of the third day feeling he was dying he called me to him				50.3382780794138
we loved sporting of all kinds better than anything so that he related to me how in the plains of the pampas the natives hunt the tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety but in face of the proof i was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the recital				5023.930567445235
porthos was the first to speak				979.3942618368782
they passed into the next drawing room where tea was prepared				7095.784572693595
did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death prurigo and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane insane raving mad his head becomes weaker				19410.55655838753
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count				288.8469296333467
the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their thanks to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some orders to a sailor and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte d aix				26261.179249398934
he commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded				2556.1626677102495
if this ship founders like the others he is a ruined man and has the unfortunate man wife or children inquired the abbé				797.9233641858948
every time he passed with a friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode but he was never to be found at home he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches				41754.981933283096
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal s baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemy s line of battle at fribourg				30572.466954353396
and aramis i have seen him also said d artagnan but he seemed to me cold ah you have seen aramis said athos turning on d artagnan a searching look				945.3839206509749
no my faith said d artagnan				80.71669527178537
d artagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away				594.8509733828237
in fact about four o clock they were all concentrated about the palais royal the courts and ground floors of which were filled with musketeers and swiss guards and there awaited the outcome of all this disturbance				3624.8911121447636
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom				10974.026719640526
you have guessed it answered aramis and they all laughed so heartily that the host appeared in order to inquire whether the gentlemen wanted anything he thought they were fighting				9676.448089716083
ah he s gone to blois the poor boy wherefore ah to inquire after the little la valliere she has sprained her foot you know you think he has i am sure of it said athos don t you see that raoul is in love indeed				896.9171969926891
and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse				7643.925836194257
he renewed against danglars fernand and villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon				3447.2837227056925
well then be more affectionate my dear villefort said the baroness				1822.0857852578317
the life of the four young men had become fraternal				40716.02472346792
but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger				4518.819599903983
at length after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken a carriage appeared coming at a quick pace on the road of sèvres				19130.55679113877
franz took the letter and read tuesday evening at seven o clock descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you				95.69707599641096
where were we i recollect you were saying said d artagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france				587.9642043153067
the devil take this gout athos and aramis took their leave but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the duke s cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned				33288.76765065392
the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited				6730.145456279076
it will be a splendid session chapter 100				22696.48624901338
what sort of a man is he ask the vicomte de morcerf you hear m de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess				1964.0794292024323
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch				16865.020121930924
he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto				6632.97368476365
sire it is something more opaque than the fog indeed said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed athos				152.84490488324786
at nine o clock tomorrow rita s father will be here with the money it is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste				5971.917028096341
the cardinal pronounced the single word hanged the king was invited to come and see the hanging				35982.551286445145
you know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid i will do better than that said albert my mother is wishing to go to the sea side what day is fixed for your dinner saturday this is tuesday well tomorrow evening we leave and the day after we shall be at tréport				38840.610536012275
lucien looked at her for a moment in silence				714.1694521664659
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber				720.0810844327866
in that case i will forgive him and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him				50.3382780794138
i even think that with economy i could manage it with two thousand livres good god cried she two thousand livres				2517.508808756657
the stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on guard				1393.9314608393406
gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible that will give me time to pay him the officers were full of thanks and took away their prey				16058.878953093865
morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard				30670.85208062763
look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of d artagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d artagnan				80.11383820546554
raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit				29952.591864827184
and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude				1694.2568141621005
it is the count s reply poor kitty became as pale as death she suspected what the letter contained				10710.443078001403

i was obliged to sound a retreat toward the rue tiquetonne i was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where i have been concealed between two mattresses				28599.721741889603

three days passed seventy two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes				2962.201753753235
oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man				179.10779018591725
aramis went to cromwell s desk tore off three bits of paper of equal size wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions and presented them open to mordaunt who by a movement of his head indicated that he left the matter entirely to aramis				151.46885407360074
at the moment he was about to go out lord de winter appeared in the corridor followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of the swoon of milady				406.598741136024

yes said he at length it is so				430.7715847548306
as little sensitive as was the heart of d artagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance				4247.581307193914
mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please i want capital to build my plans upon capital nothing replied mercédès with a mournful smile				397.4947825992149

perhaps it was some man of rank who had grave reasons for hating the fallen king and who learning that the king was about to flee and escape him threw himself in the way with a mask on his face and an axe in his hand not as substitute for the executioner but as an ambassador of fate possibly and if that were the case would your honor condemn his action it is not for me to judge				9977.576962882715

mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed				692.0271353944912
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy				11401.381279032305
then he let his head sink upon his two hands while d artagnan stood before him stupefied				3167.453559190161
it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third				18861.699946255714
the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal shaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin				39392.145251351096

now of two hundred and fifty one members who composed the parliament there were one hundred and ninety one who were in the way and might have upset his political wagon				15826.004996632215
she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte				4733.704554751844

at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters				5029.515409821336
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room				219.26513885677363
he reached it before the carriage arrived				1867.6306612671815
he therefore drew near to the table and took the second glass				1119.8636752026455
a piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few hours sleep lying over the mouth of the cave				28162.581356828363
but i too have had the idea you have and two or three times the same fancy has come over me but i have always given it up				1256.5079815059914

ah said the prince laughing i thought we should come to that				539.2039572977335
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you i must try and persuade m danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may be compelled to ask us in return what said debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house why not				591.6428145901608

and the steward followed the notary out of the room				219.3747385858332
edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes				492.3635269086445
he was of middle height but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers				844.8201979788205
we might say that was his dream				1102.8104353759702
d artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere				41900.86029829889
the footmen were hastening through the rooms with waiters loaded with ices				44880.36857253983

he would have inquired after them of their mistresses but he was neither acquainted with porthos s nor aramis s and as to athos he had none				4342.2016009043855
should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart				360.69231569442064
he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present				3211.714434862589
if richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great				7063.74737917533
yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle the poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while milady was reading with her lynx s eyes the very depths of his heart				360.6754609213533
of the evil you have done said the voice				412.9877575049484
he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him				50.34084648321234

the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for				1173.8583511323125
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so d artagnan saw that he became pale				675.8171466871153
i must speak to him about it as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement				3957.1351847565334
ah your pardon said dantès frowning in his turn i did not perceive that there were three of us then turning to mercédès he inquired who is this gentleman one who will be your best friend dantès for he is my friend my cousin my brother it is fernand the man whom after you edmond i love the best in the world				822.1780503324067

dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing a grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury				14387.88054505904
next moment the door opened and the man disappeared the scoundrel said aramis				151.4969525849276

then put down three hundred livres said the procurator s wife with a sigh				1081.68128845994
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that d artagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place				1078.9366694985995
the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman				931.7684069087574

so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all				335.6409362386312
but d artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips				448.3129950703955

well said d artagnan one is never killed in a first engagement nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killed well he will die bravely but hold should such a misfortune happen well athos passed his hand across his pale brow				1392.3092610478982

d artagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had not whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subject been able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence				31308.12952067136

monsieur the principal of amiens monsieur the curate of montdidier and i are arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much interested i shall be delighted to have your opinion the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight replied d artagnan who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking and you had better be satisfied believe me with the knowledge of these gentlemen the two men in black bowed in their turn				1019.472460537215
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong				8785.787653572675
a rondeau said the curate mechanically				19856.581226773927

now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile				397.4944035188306

now let us return to the mission with which you wish to charge me and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of your eminence deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise that i may not commit an error there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors				45999.303348637695
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever				18204.90486509359

i was a very insignificant person do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place				1078.9361550216267
meantime d artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword				947.8227018464657
for my own part i have laid aside even the name of my father and altogether disown his political principles				4079.82119287497
his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercédès exercised over him				50.34028238329771
yes i was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not armed to the teeth replied mazarin				778.4730148735543

i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state oh mother murmured renée				16943.74015657923

he will treat me better the next time i see him you have the means then of touching him i have the means of making myself feared mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwell s letter				592.0198433552512
i shall be at home till midday or if not i will leave a receipt with my steward the money you desire shall be at your house by ten o clock tomorrow morning my dear count replied danglars				455.0963467546834

where were they taken asked athos				153.84174353726556

the emperor now king of the petty island of elba after having held sovereign sway over one half of the world counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls after having been accustomed to hear the vive napoléons of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings uttered in ten different languages was looked upon here as a ruined man separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne				4932.311036335221
how happy i am at this word she athos who had seated himself quietly started up				1256.5217620245471

go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister de longueville that i thank her for the present that she made me of you and i came sir added raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for i thought you would be glad to see me again athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter				2546.1036482625823
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four but you are not one of us said porthos				145.04044495885424
ah let him say now if he does not recognize me each word fell like a dagger on morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom and fell back on his seat overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair				1469.881815244073
the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table				750.2068213828794
i positively refuse intrigues terrify me				126.71577697450277
d artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour				1300.280504434733
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room				219.26074764258593
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal				410.116532619418
this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d artagnan s adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the fight a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness muttering nevertheless a plague upon these gascons				31590.95804151909
once past the frontier andrea proposed making money of his diamonds and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank notes he always carried about with him in case of accident he would then find himself possessor of about 50 000 livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all				335.6406161466434
i ve a great desire to drink the king s health said athos				152.86108557253928
as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign				5183.634638671137
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake				3995.564459745621
why did we not destroy the child with the mother what need you fear said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves				3276.003210730117
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed d artagnan aside with his hand				231.98648491562494
when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you and have i ever since by word or look given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you				95.69693910074358
you are somewhat blasé i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others				1416.8309088960789

yes speak of dinner in a country where for a feast they eat boiled mutton and as a treat drink beer				13712.772716503594
ten times as i told you he came to see dantès father and offered to receive him in his own house and the night or two before his death as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old man s debts and buried him decently and so edmond s father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone				3363.8133529513057
andrea felt his heart leap with joy				756.9854150773565
but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious				15873.043726881657

you are mistaken it is olivain who leaves me you are to remain on the contrary olivain is to stay and i am to go				1838.1313511898518

these two gentlemen shall decide between us but first i will state the case to them				157.71559822261653
and since when have you become afraid of a quarrel i am always afraid of a quarrel when i am expected at any place and when such a quarrel might possibly prevent my reaching it				88.82664901908853
would god send the same dreams to you as to me if you did not love me				126.06248378310968
all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting				9676.475774295739
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken				6451.642046168341
mazarin resumed his reading it is important therefore monseigneur that i should be informed as to the intentions of france				587.965886496795
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to d artagnan and a well known voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening planchet cried d artagnan beside himself with joy				755.7094195711582
but doctor you see me already so grieved how can i introduce into my house so much scandal after so much sorrow				3045.416103688354

he saw that he was on the highest point of the island a statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam				10368.391532148944
must i take anything with me money if you have any yes fortunately they have left me all i had so much the better for i have expended all mine in chartering a vessel here said milady placing a bag full of louis in felton s hands				484.0808461351845

pardieu said he here is a strange thing				1211.0432316109561
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead				2464.653101338481

richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than i am				1744.5858986040998
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with d artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter				45054.9081943185
with what ideas does that letter inspire you oh it is simple enough madame it inspires me with the idea that m danglars has left suspiciously certainly but is this all you have to say to me i do not understand you said debray with freezing coldness				34381.38414580176
when the transports of the two lovers were calmer milady who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that d artagnan had was the first to return to reality and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de wardes were already arranged in his mind				473.3070170951629

an approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him				50.33867413313605
and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study				2366.3489694005902
the queen on her part thus chided softened immediately and sat down and in an almost weeping voice letting her arms fall by her side said pardon me sir and attribute this violence to what i suffer				17779.220648222166

they had expected resistance they had expected to be thwarted to have to force the gates to overturn the guards				1703.118976804643
they continued to admire it but said no more about it and with a rapid change of thought the conversation passed suddenly to another subject				1692.5812826609088

he then began to ascend the path				17609.31193556477
vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover				4692.076187504983
all the bodily fatigue of the day all the preoccupation of mind which the events of the evening had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber				13255.077977588877

and yet you pity a man who without being bitten by one of his race has yet murdered his benefactor and who now unable to kill anyone because his hands are bound wishes to see his companion in captivity perish				6292.082804134648
he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch				8963.344825059889

traitors screamed lord winter whose voice they heard whilst his men quitting their ranks dispersed all over the plain				13420.818207503618
as to d artagnan he did not budge from his apartment				938.7289390536665
but you are unable to oppose them you whose mind is so quick and whose will is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself				767.7213909593688

and yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veins passion drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the reader pleases				31761.668044194637
at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria				55848.55554458875

50039m oh the magnificent hair said louise with regret				14988.090757056967
your affectionate anne buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the reading of the letter then when it was ended as if he had met with a bitter disappointment he asked have you nothing else to say to me by the living voice laporte the queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself for she had advice that your assassination would be attempted and is that all is that all replied buckingham impatiently				4405.5871213441915
the young people uttered a cry of joy while maximilian raised his head but let it fall again immediately				1383.8371608171717
but m de tréville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queen s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful				34852.01101440436
the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty five or twenty six years of age				4095.2306346328514
the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air				1218.754967579725

very well what did i say to you				95.86062350160539
m de tréville required this intelligence to be repeated to him twice and each time his companions saw his brow become darker				10881.245500318262
then he felt and felt again the contents of the tankard he held in his hand and instead of the lively liquor expected by blaisois and mousqueton he found beneath his fingers the grains of some coarse powder				9299.822803849851
next day m morrel seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after dinner he placed his daughter beside him took her head in his arms and held her for a long time against his bosom				2964.2152329576825
come then said d artagnan you are right				1369.4071112448632
i am lost murmured she i am lost				1015.1856355978473
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor s misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him				50.33845810344671
if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil				1439.1571602096503
decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard				14867.609542500186
richelieu and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can and he left the chamber without once looking behind him				50.33833808735323
how hot you look my good barrois said valentine				683.776618269862

i promised to come said felton and i have come you promised me something else what my god said the young man who in spite of his self command felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow				1392.3092610478982
at seven o clock in the morning he arose and called planchet who at the second summons opened the door his countenance not yet quite freed from the anxiety of the preceding night				877.9434366228877
your host that is to say yes and no how yes and no he furnishes it it is true but he does not know that he has that honor explain yourself mousqueton your conversation is full of instructive things that is it monsieur				1109.4329512900674

faria smiled encouragingly on him and the young man retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged friend				526.223532648699
i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp				11260.472671959638
his disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept him aloof from all friendships				13423.403872654939

the queen and de winter continued to converse for some time in low voices in order that the young princess should not overhear them but the precaution was needless she was in deep converse with her own thoughts				849.4380588753186
each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold				1838.1707936328676
the magistrate was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the door he did not move as he heard it open and the door keeper pronounce the words walk in madame and then reclose it but no sooner had the man s footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every corner of the room				219.26032943629752
besides it came into the young man s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair				1232.1637885835605
my husband could accompany me but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek				4034.2515138203826

a kind of steward appeared just as d artagnan and his companions were prepared to mount				18682.836124255253
but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it				88.82664901908853
oh i wish it you with all my heart added caderousse with his hoarse laugh				2733.96033155986

so much the better the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied m				666.6301621485937

sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest how				2888.4969354155855

soon as kitty left him d artagnan directed his steps toward the rue férou				36946.113152514416
whom does this belong to he inquired				3003.575894422914

your song is as dismal as a de profundis and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out silence then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton				681.1215436599513
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect				6924.282045656578

this noble gentleman with his lofty glance this handsome cavalier so brilliant in feats of arms that every one was surprised that he held in his hand a sword only instead of a baton of command				4343.953616784615
the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose				1161.0668665587496

well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman and then he was called fernand only fernand fernand mondego you are sure pardieu i have bought enough fish of him to know his name then why did you think of giving your daughter to him because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me what oh nothing ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego				12401.484245532998
however for my part i would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor				16022.837458691936

the news caused a great sensation throughout the house madame de villefort would not believe it and valentine was thunderstruck				17873.675904589523
it begins to develop itself said d artagnan				80.24945270963111
well sir you ought to know that we no longer have a police since we are no longer at paris i think your majesty will have no need to apply to the police to know where my friends are but that if you will deign to interrogate the cardinal he can reply without any further inquiry than into his own recollections but god forgive me cried anne with that disdainful curl of the lips peculiar to her i believe that you are yourself interrogating yes madame here i have a right to do so for it concerns monsieur d artagnan d artagnan he repeated in such a manner as to bow the regal brow with recollections of the weak and erring woman				931.7528564755468
if you know monsieur de tréville you must have visited him often said milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the end				986.1085138860592

one of the sailors leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and dantès guessed they were at the end of the voyage and that they were mooring the boat				2020.3283361279348
here are the august signatures of your majesty s hand if you think you are right in giving them to me you shall do so but from this very moment you are free from any obligation to keep them and d artagnan full of splendid pride and manly intrepidity placed in anne s hands in a bundle the papers that he had one by one won from her with so much difficulty				3907.327447367071
i would rather find it triply bolted and indeed the little note and pin upon the table confirmed or rather corroborated the sad truth				2252.383359542873
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself				264.2318795467692

beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days				1678.9891406887675
indeed count you are the most polished man in the world				822.2972406647211
a handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal next moment d artagnan entered				726.992602226514

lord wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo				202.1432592490653
monte cristo pressed on that pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once the one violently the other secretly				18349.840049198338
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying sir have you asked the notary				2135.6041501118502
at each shot morrel turned pale				679.0114490451737
my mother experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble				4876.070717092757
if you can be satisfied with my dinner it consists of cooked tetragones and fruits what do you mean by tetragones asked d artagnan uneasily				5288.691341770736
do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of life are now exhausted in me and death he continued looking at his paralyzed arm and leg has but half its work to do				915.8986898015091
he has just left me replied de winter after telling me all				335.7046406193312
however there are plenty in the world but you don t look in the right direction for them my lord indeed				896.9176246762385
porthos and i will stay here the friends obeyed				2394.1023217004285
i have let thee perish at this instant in the midst of the silver circle illumined by the light of the moon the same whirlpool which had been made by the sinking men was again obvious and first were seen rising above the waves a wisp of hair then a pale face with open eyes yet nevertheless the eyes of death then a body which after rising of itself even to the waist above the sea turned gently on its back according to the caprice of the waves and floated				34121.830266574776
how sire cried the young queen affecting surprise you are giving me then two more i shall have fourteen in fact the king counted them and the twelve studs were all on her majesty s shoulder				1457.3468077841355
i was about to give it when you anticipated me that then is your opinion asked aramis				151.47672690978996
do you promise i swear to you i will it is well				642.7243155909525
instead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to st germain my dear fellow said athos i ride horses when i have any when i have none i go afoot well said d artagnan smiling at the misanthropy of athos which from any other person would have offended him i ride what i can get i am not so proud as you				95.69693910074358
when i go back to france i must suggest some such convenient course to cardinal mazarin and the coadjutor				3972.8502957801616
in a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post boy and horses which were harnessed and put in the post chaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap				33901.52529316038
the conversation between milady and the cavalier was so animated that d artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but the pretty soubrette perceiving his presence				1698.041935975418
do you know the assassin asked morrel				434.9456417154
he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him				50.33843410020513
mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside				3776.969206574441
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all d artagnan blushed				7360.856798129524
let us then hope for the best hope is so sweet a comforter				32868.23204614499
i have weighed all the chances calculated the time required for all the forms something must have happened and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning forehead against the fence				12261.375114018912
they found raoul near his tent reclining on a truss of hay of which his horse stole some mouthfuls the young man s eyes were red and he seemed dejected				29457.020890845717
the several members of that group were much excited				7824.017297566604
nay do not press my hand edmond you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness				6856.585780259831
on my part i will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be suspected				29933.48796294226
i do not know why but i imagine that this woman wholly unknown to me as she is and wholly unknown to her as i am has an influence over my life well perhaps you are right said athos				152.84490488324786
however the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness				17701.615241132866
porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed planchet				662.3501186496658
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				9732.458515618513
her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion				31129.761720503662
certes if the knife had been left in her power she would now have thought not of killing herself but of killing the baron				4526.781910731196
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril				17403.792087513015
for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours perhaps some day i shall have to do with the king s attorney but can you not say that sir				538.6655756058864
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir				538.6658324617099
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him				50.339490253662625
i go to morrow my friend replied d artagnan				80.18366230856263
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants				7837.5642898275855
well madame said mazarin bowing i desire that you give me a share in your friends as i have shared with you the little industry and talent that heaven has given me				126.05737442814996
science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them				157.71010837815618
athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him				50.33854211488241
aramis the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance and who answered to the last of these three names immediately quitted the group of which they had formed a part and advanced toward the cabinet the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered				726.9846291572464
as soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from laporte and ran to meet her				164.2809769001447
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers				9533.063106868183
he is at vincennes did i say monsieur de beaufort				2695.721633567758
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future				1442.2616386913817
well she is a monster who at twenty five years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals				34393.452484014735
do you hear the guns pray				12121.854676718025
and what will he promise us said d artagnan				80.19188315813508
carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions				1083.607398241025
well are you going away in that manner				804.521758889971
sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying valentine had the old man s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there				485.7512209876534
because i would not annoy my little benedetto				4356.740252756114
lord de winter exclaimed the count				290.52551904811565
the king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the palais royal				1984.9679360272821
this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the half kindness half cruelty with which his host related the brief narrative				6718.615121046684
a sort of smile played on his lips				448.84731642457933
you are pale and agitated sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor to mademoiselle de la valliere asked athos quickly				1625.1367796862532
well said beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir				538.7883666535
i don t understand said porthos				145.84075905726095
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine o clock in the morning to take a third letter				592.0198433552512
pardieu beauchamp mine shall be a splendid funeral when such resolutions are made albert they should be promptly executed				4452.182702077387
haydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors she continued when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier				26820.15539472543
explain my child he said explain my child he said explain where did you find this purse in a house in the allées de meilhan no				412.68991303269803
who has paid me this attention my mistress sir				538.8613352592271
parisians and frondeurs as they were the two friends expected to find the same misery the same fears the same intrigue in the enemy s camp but what was their surprise after passing saint denis to hear that at saint germain people were singing and laughing and leading generally cheerful lives				10394.637966304463
we are four of us said d artagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time				473.8399461812379
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with you are either cowards or traitors the eyes of the scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king				424.998600706985
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory				2797.678854992596
at the same time the door opened a man appeared on the threshold				3906.3177457166707
i will introduce you to them but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars				455.1002528947232
he drank to their good health and the travelers returned his politeness				12472.280784141803
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds				4177.575223333539
what do you want with us he asked of groslow				1420.6680853345315
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered				5796.632281519136
i don t remember him groslow is the man who broke parry s head and is now getting ready to break ours oh				1081.739058015687
according to the laws of dueling at that period d artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased				3203.6323610462914
i am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills myself this is a magnificent emerald and the largest i have ever seen said château renaud although my mother has some remarkable family jewels i had three similar ones returned monte cristo				202.14335563850557

this lackey was my compatriot and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between us				454.03858449839583
he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed				4683.648931354933
peste returned albert i compliment you on it i have its fellow he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and it cost me 3 000 francs let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself				264.2318795467692
but let us see whatever i may be she added hardly restraining herself from kissing that pure brow let us see what profession you wish to follow athos standing looked at them both with indescribable pleasure				1281.0863341484003
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction				6181.614926223238
it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shop people and the bands of mendicants reappeared				5280.2750847700345
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor				10281.985776452122

tell me now can you deny all this and who told you this fine story sire asked tréville quietly				2383.118036359478
going along d artagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not				591.6428145901608

we want money for our return to paris i am much attached to that horse athos and there again you are wrong				1961.1857625120397
for part of the day he went into the courtyard seated himself on a stone with his head bare and exposed to the blazing sun				7100.34704235679
twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced at luigi and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features were agitated once even the blade of his knife half drawn from its sheath had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare				40843.741767452746
when franz appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon				2213.348762403816
but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered				20494.24431651854
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed				5036.676910946996
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside oh no				412.72080957319406
it is now three years madame since i saw you for the first time and during those three years i have loved you thus				1454.5108343527595
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write				2308.33721153445
she entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the count s attention				886.0760381012204
lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient bertuccio bowed and left the room				219.2839593422767

p s be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for you for you as aramis athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear				4604.369612544614
in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes gigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from men s shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callot s temptation of st anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends				28403.230163208616
i will warn them what the devil are you going to do cried d artagnan you will be shot but athos heeded not his advice				10560.454512495591
then as it was cold he asked for his gown which was brought to him				50.34419520645952

well i will go to england a second time i will go and find buckingham you shall not do that d artagnan said athos coolly				6727.347630036105
well by means of these lines which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths this last explanation was wholly lost upon dantès who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the earth				2400.5930920233723
scarron turned his chair toward the door raoul blushed athos made a sign to aramis who went and hid himself in the enclosure of a window				533.2728378268346
ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan				2126.126211632935
yes but why don t you come there also athos colored a little and answered should i go i shall be delighted to see you there halloo planchet cried the gascon from the door we must set out in ten minutes give the horses some hay then turning to athos he added i seem to miss something here				688.995958306576
grimaud s first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour s riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe				47334.18049593844
with the assistance of blaisois and grimaud the friends succeeded in turning the stone over				1848.5021956677874
porthos i doubt if you can wear it but should it be too tight never mind you can wear the breastplate and the hat with the red feathers it happened however that the second soldier was a swiss of gigantic proportions so save that some few of the seams split his uniform fitted porthos perfectly				2150.394517827371
raoul really felt tired but he was desirous of testing his strength and brought up in the principles of athos and certain of having heard him speak a thousand times of stages of twenty five leagues he did not wish to fall far short of his model				18904.343470809235
sir said madame de saint méran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child yes madame replied villefort it is not only projected but arranged your intended son in law is named m franz d épinay yes madame is he not the son of general d épinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of elba the same does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished mother said villefort m				666.6330230210214
i shall therefore not visit either of these telegraphs but one in the open country where i shall find a good natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to work you are a singular man said villefort				302.98523714578164
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table what are the two fish asked danglars				455.1002528947232
ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him				50.346655879847596
there they are the coachman turning around gave friquet a slash with his whip which made him scream with pain				3135.3410667038697
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law				2552.1179927109974

it was the governor who hearing of faria s illness from the jailer had come in person to see him				50.33980230324302
it is the people who do not obey that i punish and not those who like you obey but too well				642.6700718340767

but i will answer for these two words being delivered to their address oh my god				569.4572118084061

finally he promised that he would leave her mistress s presence at an early hour that evening and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid				3892.5433738307074
0065m as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event				11204.726280953962
at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet				29738.352834232715
the king was lying on his bed resting on his elbow				11155.041591054587
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me this threat brought no reply				1028.4844196499857

planchet turned and returned the billet				16124.714631142198
oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances are you then a coward cried villefort in a contemptuous voice				412.83004837025896
however amidst all the prisoner s efforts to elude a systematic examination raoul had recognized his natural accent				3051.870557792016
no indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected				29300.51396455537
he will never see you again all is over				1848.1179301569769
you believe so i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a time well then said monte cristo you have all the documents with you your excellency i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these papers i neglected to bring them that is unfortunate returned monte cristo				202.1432592490653
well inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor 20147m why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to byron5 drew a smile to franz s countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him				50.3382780794138
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed				16411.82090586755
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said sharp true my lord exclaimed la ramee				1392.4546637890883
a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him				50.34669189059495
a knot of rose colored ribbons fell from his shoulder almost to the ground				1793.328946790329
without your aid continued he repeating the count s words i should have been a dead man thrice dead my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance				3670.422921723183
if you had only to deal with four men d artagnan i would allow you to go alone				858.367680175595
personally i am on bad terms with him on account of the quarrels between madame de montbazon my mother in law and madame de longueville				8360.343287816142
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible				849.4238824665638
he was to wait at the gate if by chance the musketeers should appear the carriage was to set off as fast as possible pass around the convent and go and wait for milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood				14621.273688727691
well my captain said porthos quite beside himself the truth is that we were six against six				4816.45543017586
monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20 000 francs apiece for his horses				903.4553865555653
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped				46581.89245700509
holloa said he what does that mean if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal				410.1122303483416
an instant afterward the three young men separated agreeing to meet again at four o clock with athos and leaving planchet to guard the house				465.28810907565816
only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues the two young men looked at morcerf as if to say are you mad or are you laughing at us and i also said morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon ah cried albert it is very lucky that m morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth my dear albert said debray what you tell us is so extraordinary ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of them they have no time				473.8390424041263
i do not understand italian yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant s shoulder				1457.3488925369577
you see you were deceived murmured the magistrate come and see her and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her each time you have applied to me said the doctor it has been too late still i will go				1838.1269687484266
when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood instead of answering me as a friend you played with me as a child the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle d artagnan said athos reproachfully				35672.0723654217
come your excellency the count added turning to franz here is luigi vampa who will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed franz approached the chief advancing several steps to meet him				50.33832608575962
but it was not upon corsica the very houses of which he could distinguish or on sardinia or on the island of elba with its historical associations or upon the almost imperceptible line that to the experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed				39279.67940736001
it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes				42216.164498940554
but who told you i was inactive but if the plot had succeeded i wished it to do so i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of england yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold why so asked mordaunt				1926.721760089706
bowing under the weight of twenty four years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of château renaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son s life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young man s heart every feeling of filial piety				13027.890919396486
i have something better than that said monte cristo i have a slave				3318.105027627233
is the countess up yet if you wish i will inquire yes ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three o clock and that i request permission to introduce someone to her the valet left the room				219.26032943629752
my position is like that of a person wounded in a dream he feels the wound though he can not recollect when he received it				88.82732671522399
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature				32816.9906470823
sometimes but very rarely my father summoned me and my mother to the terrace of the palace these were hours of recreation for me as i never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of the slaves and selim s fiery lance				35695.38336311547
yes sir replied the abbé and you are the person whom m de boville formerly an inspector of prisons sends to me from the prefect of police exactly sir one of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris yes sir replied the stranger with a slight hesitation and blushing				10651.302882073283
everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror				1755.341897038513
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements				13120.494242713155

barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend				21370.00812753615
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach				3477.0291828532395
during this time in the kiosk at my father s feet were seated twenty palikares concealed from view by an angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats				33819.34263578861
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions				6882.555233173577
will the marquis honor me by a few moments private conversation ah it is really a serious matter then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on villefort s brow				1392.3079332389484
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris eugénie covered her face with her hands				484.0808461351845
i inquired immediately on my return to paris the house had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine years				880.6918890895314
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy				755.7119420276923
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty				1937.6996140590315

i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds well said aramis what do you say to that i say my dear d herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan the division being made by the light of bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis				5711.081278661342
to form the slightest idea of his feelings one must have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and its tear moistened eyes raised to heaven				741.5904031000097
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it no madame no the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features				5873.155404316958
milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked d artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england				1053.2739320947105
he grew deadly pale placed his hand upon his heart which was breaking and at once perceived all the treachery				13414.202709183577

under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell				12783.684492049311
i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed				2849.323410909201
what do you mean to say i mean to say that i have a good reason but that it is difficult to explain you must be aware at all events that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but one thing at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my family no sir said danglars i merely suspend my decision that is all and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received into your good graces then count if you will not wait we must look upon these projects as if they had never been entertained the count bit his lips till the blood almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the door towards which he had been directing his steps and again confronted the banker				3093.4747330799005
albert de morcerf said beauchamp rising in his turn i can not throw you out of window for three weeks that is to say for twenty four days to come nor have you any right to split my skull open till that time has elapsed				38993.66961689616

himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear				26690.611312163746
his heart ceased beating he closed his eyes and leaned upon the table				750.2118295704389

and as i am a connoisseur in such things having had a few of my own once i estimated it at a thousand pistoles i hope said d artagnan half dead with fright you made no mention of my diamond on the contrary my dear friend this diamond became our only resource with it i might regain our horses and their harnesses and even money to pay our expenses on the road athos you make me tremble cried d artagnan				80.11383820546554

when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of alexander s feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother				1345.4117455007417

what cried he in an accent of greater astonishment than before your second witness is monsieur aramis doubtless				15350.782634413776
he had recognized intelligence in the high forehead courage in the dark eye and bent brow and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth				6158.689658359076
but i am sure of one thing that those who laugh at him in his presence will never laugh a second time here goes the barony said the queen she signed a patent				36447.03461776499
50089m maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtier s eyes seemed to say quicker quicker in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentine s				837.4998346649188
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors				4077.4834796458035
milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vertigo				33956.95358279435
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides				12602.835326098282
my poor friend resumed d artagnan not having seen you for four or five years i concluded you were dead i faith said rochefort there s no great difference i think between a dead man and one who has been buried alive now i have been buried alive or very nearly so and for what crime are you imprisoned in the bastile do you wish me to speak the truth yes well then i don t know have you any suspicion of me rochefort no				412.6891258899073
for you told me your father desired the marriage it is my mother who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not smile on the proposed union				12671.167639464968
i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself				929.733065085979
sir said d artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman				3321.416632642386
but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together ma foi said maximilian in consternation				9831.370521903393
then he had a moment s hesitation				4076.7213869843245
the road is never very safe during fair time oh as to the robbers said joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle				31801.221476715564
75 does your eminence command that they both be instantly arrested it will be too late they will be gone but still we can make sure that they are so take ten men of my guardsmen and search the two houses thoroughly instantly monseigneur and rochefort went hastily out of the apartment				938.6792544553564
now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed				692.0284553327606
many small donations 1 to 5 000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs				6994.14730826214
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step				1544.1021613141525
the glass cutter had entered and was feeling his way his arms stretched out before him				50.342838886692064
the next morning when kitty presented herself at d artagnan s she was no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days but on the contrary sad as death				781.2255279552935
at this moment the door of the dining room unclosed with a creak and porthos perceived through the half open flap the little clerk who not being allowed to take part in the feast ate his dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and kitchen				6042.761580016618
more than this the conversation which had just taken place between mercédès and himself had awakened so many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with them				157.70589712014845
well said athos don t you hear monsieur de busigny who does you the honor to ask you a question				909.9787516377419
a capital blow you gave cried porthos				145.48340249478852
courtiers becoming every instant more numerous succeeded one another day and night in the little house of the bridge of la pierre in which the cardinal had established his residence				5072.08620418268
u s laws alone swamp our small staff				26191.822288865642
good day to you have you slept well excellently athos but what are you looking for				1173.8404396119977
i suspected where she was concealed				5179.780143070904
lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a fight				3757.0810889958393
oh said julie pressing the purse to her heart no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy day you will leave us will you not you have guessed rightly madame replied monte cristo smiling in a week i shall have left this country where so many persons who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my father perished of hunger and grief while announcing his departure the count fixed his eyes on morrel and remarked that the words i shall have left this country had failed to rouse him from his lethargy				5382.499038139754
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms				514.0512258894998
he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him				50.34273086279492
and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judge s seat but on the prisoner s bench 30263m you said madame danglars				455.097214782906
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit				1387.0742795097406
d artagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted				9718.84266637568
do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated oh yes i read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my memory repeat it to me dantès paused a moment then said this is it word for word the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper again by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris				458.21692206865623
but i make war in my own way the two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley				12615.834564941133
if they meant to execute him at la grêve it could scarcely be worth while to gag him as they had nearly reached the place of execution				3070.2764820105976
then the hand was withdrawn leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring				3455.001738691693
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night				877.9430179869341
tis a matter of conscience with them as with us meantime here we are enemies said porthos				145.04618540835847
ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less				5608.18716805004
the king went straight to him				50.97330532133174

you really vilify me cried olivain				7934.890927227175
it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first				1026.542232525767
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten				5114.334443105098
the blow was sped by d artagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom				2964.0809584420326
then resumed he mad desperate determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything honor and happiness my poor brother returned to lille and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place surrendered himself and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison				867.8226697278769
you assert a great deal said mazarin				779.0155341277763
d artagnan looked attentively at the building				10501.221116276178
but there must be some cause for this strange scene the count of morcerf s adventure exasperates the young man have you anything to do with it it was through haydée that the chamber was informed of his father s treason indeed said morrel				434.32948358411005

i m beginning to feel queer cried blaisois				3182.0530096443663
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me				126.09681199513244
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy				755.8088828076937
however you may look and see added the lackey raising the curtained entrance of the tent				7755.796911304788
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security that is policy this policy of louis xiii				1413.5263670025358
already up raoul exclaimed the count				290.45750712896296

no one at villefort s doubted that a duel would ensue from it				88.84460971374637
steel is for gentlemen and seizing the butcher by the throat porthos said he kill this fellow for me with a single blow porthos raised his terrible fist which whistled through the air like a sling and the portentous mass fell with a smothered crash on the insulter s skull and crushed it				88.82652195163874
i practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world				822.1796185140824

if they had discovered milady s retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to béthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends				429.7047868213225
they entered the roadstead but as they drew near in order to cast anchor a little cutter looking like a coastguard formidably armed approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which directed its course to the ladder				3764.7853295167847
is it not true aramis said porthos turning toward another musketeer				997.738158090112
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs				20075.78171623225
my dear fellow it is perfectly ridiculous stupid				8793.164074839735
all four were to meet the next day at eleven o clock				883.4354654865707
30023m m de villefort was not only a magistrate he was almost a diplomatist				38279.198049484585

come come calm yourself my sweet girl				991.6244374044282
louvieres sprang forward to snatch his sword which stood against a chair in a corner of the room but a glance from the worthy broussel who in the midst of it all did not lose his presence of mind checked this foolhardy action of despair				1469.881815244073
so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration				1480.7725070329839

the matter enters completely into the duties of the post let him be sent for instantly he is most likely at my hôtel				4128.239591816682
there was some surprise however that as he was with his face to the enemy he should have received a ball between his shoulders				2126.677799064091
the prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his horse				508.02940100580696

well signor pastrini said franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi vampa				1874.6328360386026
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously				25240.754518315556
i have one the seal of which i am not to break till i reach london but since you tell me to whom it is addressed tis useless to wait till then d artagnan tore open the envelope of the letter				592.0198433552512
d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen				17938.566944385286
after dinner morrel usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocéens and read the semaphore this day he did not leave the house but returned to his office				5906.672308327744
there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars for there before my eyes beneath my feet all around me i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth after making the tour of the garden a second time the count re entered his carriage while bertuccio who perceived the thoughtful expression of his master s features took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word				527.2573456253132
but take no notice we know all about that well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple what asked d artagnan				80.11425842037197

why your protégé m andrea cavalcanti ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize m andrea at least not as concerns m danglars and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it what do you think he is paying his addresses i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions				3897.227297376814

all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next a sublime spot a resting place full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking				14543.811900194914

but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret				1505.6721172903362
do you hear ah valentine said maximilian give me but one finger through this opening in the grating one finger the littlest finger of all that i may have the happiness of kissing it maximilian we said we would be to each other as two voices two shadows as you will valentine shall you be happy if i do what you wish oh yes valentine mounted on a bench and passed not only her finger but her whole hand through the opening				3430.6591649237457
ah good evening my dear m caderousse said monte cristo what are you doing here at such an hour 40156m the abbé busoni exclaimed caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied				3167.52605727842
that will do said milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you for monsieur de wardes said kitty				2956.496566457017

quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal				410.1128170190126
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady s chamber				720.0886384236043
wretched wretched that i am hallo catalan				17623.205678391416
this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist				12238.617597122158
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away				594.8438822488977
i had provided myself with a dark lantern				15618.537052176644

over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a full length portrait of anne of austria so perfect in its resemblance that d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it				88.82656430743515
i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden				1366.4705295357937
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort				303.16212569536134

d artagnan wiped his damp forehead and the king slid off his bed saying let us go at this moment laporte reappeared				5280.270049109704
she with a still smiling countenance took his arm and passed with him under a low arched door which by a vaulted passage lighted only at the farther end led to a stone staircase around an angle of stone				1996.974570323845

with you d artagnan with you porthos all four reunited for the first time for twenty years we would dare not only england but the three kingdoms put together and did you promise the queen resumed d artagnan petulantly to storm the tower of london to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is cromwell				1618.4343587256308
i am here because i am a soldier and have to obey orders i have taken an oath to obey and i do obey but you who have taken no such oath why are you here and what cause do you represent that most sacred in the world said athos the cause of misfortune of religion royalty				8063.276171712159

the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen				32141.366963528842
now barring all that i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine ah well exclaimed château renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more				1128.3799687684798
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged				27638.393001358014
just now d artagnan continued you were disguised i mean to say attired as a murderer and now and now i look very much like a man who is going to be murdered oh				1081.7442161617685

have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire said the cardinal				410.11535926828486
the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriage window the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo				202.1432592490653
he thought of that young and pretty mme				194.854854175927
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back				804.7500486655982
when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it you will further say to him watch over his grace lord buckingham for they wish to assassinate him				50.338386093756284

thanks guitant i shall benefit by your advice this very evening here they separated and bidding adieu to guitant in the court of the palais royal mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down within that inclosure				31083.572343987067
is it not so certainly but if you love me as much as you say replied d artagnan do you not entertain a little fear on my account what have i to fear why that i may be dangerously wounded killed even impossible cried milady you are such a valiant man and such an expert swordsman you would not then prefer a method resumed d artagnan which would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless milady looked at her lover in silence				714.0346100551266
i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of his merits				36499.731957842014
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity				3155.089783365986
listen replied felton in a low voice				413.40525863319596
i am incredulous the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal				410.11379480532923
on the contrary we shall meet again said mercédès pointing to heaven with solemnity				7510.139524794212

ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards no said the count i was making a suit how said albert				433.80189507079245
is that what you would say he has some but he is very avaricious that is his fault				4125.901678406782
he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante				29670.591349674938
i gave the custom house officers a copy of our bill of lading and as to the other papers they sent a man off with the pilot to whom i gave them then you have nothing more to do here no everything is all right now then you can come and dine with me i really must ask you to excuse me m morrel				434.32948358411005
there he is attending mass in the chapel of the virgin d artagnan nearly jumped for joy he had despaired of finding bazin but now he thought since he held one end of the thread he would be pretty sure to reach the other end				986.1085138860592
do you know what gave him strength				1716.1796220116705

d artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army				1530.4232908983233
yes we must put the madman with the madmen the soldiers seized dantès who followed passively				34433.68898848961

rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught all these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo de medici				38153.78717505336
someone had just died in the house to which that garden belonged				5370.828656486938
as for m danglars absorbed in an interesting conversation with m cavalcanti he paid no attention to anything that was passing				7134.448278166232
he had but one thought to go forward and he went				3236.095542873616
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title				5175.805111351516
the night was dark but still the town resounded with those noises that disclose a city in a state of siege				6980.393682729752
how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either 20323m alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life				469.1688990815052

ah continued caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the south the world grows worse and worse				7643.677986477152
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and d artagnan				80.12067652193444
yes yes replied dantès eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé				797.9218422693084
there fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast projects so tumultuous that there remained no room for any capricious or material love that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption				32309.473661917844
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper				2624.111282341761
hear me said he this man has gone and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance but let us be united as we were to have been and then leave it to lord de winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife lord de winter cried felton				681.1215436599513
wait here for me and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out				528.1168821694062
look at my hat and cloak and d artagnan displayed four gunshot holes in his cloak and two in his beaver				22056.609112775637
the horses seemed to become more lively with each successive step their nostrils reddened like glowing furnaces				22800.990338034542
the daughter of ali pasha of ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki and your slave ma foi yes but how did she become so why simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day as i was passing through the market at constantinople wonderful				18237.434715851276
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes				492.38066594436316
compression is needed to explode gunpowder				15033.728596553123
the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion				5675.0577665374585
in france he cried the usurper in france				588.3321558930315
you always say trifles my dear athos said d artagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never loved the drink deadened eye of athos flashed out but only for a moment it became as dull and vacant as before				775.2102989351009
the dead are everywhere said morrel did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris maximilian said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles				1472.561671308584

there s another brave and excellent young man do you know him asked the officer				1807.3631743317314
does it belong to the smaller or to the larger of the two asked the host				788.2107256236558
with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and faria had been equally silent				1866.0212304290544
take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have more gently gently said the old man with a smile and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them do as you please but first of all pray have a servant father				446.5845661989496
now m danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught sterlets said château renaud are only found in the volga and said cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size exactly one comes from the volga and the other from lake fusaro impossible cried all the guests simultaneously				17215.30932886463
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that				539.1764469639019
although you say i do not like him i assure you i shall be happy to see him i will obey your orders my lord good bye until saturday when i may expect you may i not yes i promised you the count watched albert waving his hand to him				50.3382780794138
so you were at the races baron inquired the countess eagerly				1947.2176006960576
planchet grasped him by the throat and pressed as hard as he could				7818.184529478353
this time however his address although polite was cooler than usual				2906.75598720538
i have them at hand monsieur porthos take yours from your holsters i have them good said d artagnan seizing his own now you understand porthos not too well we are out on the king s service well for the king s service we need horses that is true said porthos				145.03864679248733

they were in the marvellous dining room before described where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers				1935.9217933084087
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery				8340.354878591721
at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings				19510.16166028267
you can see it in his eye				2053.4907887533604
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter				2363.0012296097684
not at all said d artagnan				80.67786949456277

we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other				472.0187274026679
he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m de villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy s ears				2957.329856412343
ah said d artagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds				10114.559362886152

by degrees the enchantress had clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw aside at will that is to say beauty meekness and tears and above all the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness the most devouring of all voluptuousness				28312.44306127515
wholly yours aramis d artagnan tried to recall his remembrances				17995.711451520958
yes christian and surname are the same				1671.2204905216665
an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall				855.5677222016934
barrois will open the door for you said valentine addressing morrel				434.3922407619443

parry who accompanied him stood behind him				50.54656318265128
i believe with your majesty that monsieur de tréville s guarantee is more than sufficient tréville bowed very respectfully with a joy that was not unmixed with fear he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding				32056.44959022555
now this was a sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him				50.339490253662625
on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse				2095.5624853918944

so it is agreed and if porthos makes no objection i said porthos i will do whatever you please and besides i think what the comte de la fere said just now is very good but your future career d artagnan your ambition porthos our future our ambition replied d artagnan with feverish volubility				20302.41611158511
d artagnan relates that on his first visit to m de tréville captain of the king s musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis				151.46885407360074
i see the other soldier issue from the guardroom and come toward us i think replied porthos it would be imprudent to attempt the same manoeuvre again it is said that no man can succeed twice in the same way and a failure would be ruinous				25140.479957852764
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results				5399.583555844836
don t think i want the glory of riding in your fine carriage said he oh no it s only because i am tired and also because i have a little business to talk over with you come step in said the young man				179.04246708492744
tell them said morrel in a hoarse voice tell them that i am her betrothed				2849.2799340160063
d artagnan did not know london he did not know a word of english but he wrote the name of buckingham on a piece of paper and everyone pointed out to him the way to the duke s hôtel				4128.2671508811645
along the isle of dogs and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another				581.1081177518743
one thing now is only awanting and that is that our grooms should not keep us waiting no said athos				152.84796596336392
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms				513.9438750983803
a gentleman laughed in my face				676.0124612701121
then those who dwelt in bonacieux s unfortunate house together with the nearest neighbors heard loud cries stamping of feet clashing of swords and breaking of furniture				4098.821377372058
scarcely had he descended the last step of the threshold when he saw athos bent down toward the ground as if he were looking for a crown piece in the dust				8294.246304187147
here he said take this pocket book do you give it to me yes but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison				867.8226697278769
no one could guess what the dirty rag could be i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered man				179.04425995002916
what is the matter asked milady				407.75358455848925
the camp had entered saint omer the friends made a little detour and went to the camp and gave the army an exact account of the flight of the king and queen				376.1481715512764
we are lost said d artagnan in the ear of athos				152.880038107228
on what was d artagnan thinking that he strayed thus from his path gazing at the stars of heaven and sometimes sighing sometimes smiling				827.9518826689803
my husband has five or six valises you shall choose the best				3588.04176098913
i saw him today for the first time and he can tell you on what occasion he came to demand the rent of my lodging				14542.02277252651
when i call you chevalier it is in presenting you to my guests that they may know who you are				1193.205031750195
pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean waters filter in their caves				11242.006314898757
political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation				33254.689211693745
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me hark said morrel				434.32948358411005
she felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity				5741.208870270414
and all this all this because my heart which i thought dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman s voice				412.82748929299856
d artagnan that man of iron who seemed to be made of nerve and muscle only had struck him with admiration				1480.7718009457978
they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day				483.1750033860243
this was because his love so strange so new and so ardent made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of milady de winter as through a magnifying glass one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant				25271.777607341824
the four friends during the period of these two absences had as may well be supposed the eye on the watch the nose to the wind and the ear on the hark				36766.222051338715
let us then support monarchy in order to support ourselves				3275.6970495052583
the four friends followed ten paces behind him				50.46243126457874
in dying i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron eo rus and all will be over but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress indeed beauchamp you are unbearable				42224.45897086192
thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead do not think so bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watch care to make of them instruments of his vengeance so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again				391.9701481468536
then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening				752.9793039400028
i will swear to you by my soul s salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth				2252.388729649677
she should certainly return from her exile she did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last				2114.1705649279706
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle then i am also a puzzle to your mother				1345.4117455007417
then having removed a plank from his floor and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath in which the interrogatories were made he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the accused				3732.5105259408947
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tréville				1861.2545048544866
nevertheless it seemed to him that athos was not in all respects sincere and frank				28441.31351239603
at this moment the door was opened and having questioned the servant the officer learned that master broussel was at home and at dinner				2472.204975669979
at sight of the mustaches and the naked sword the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a man				179.04536982789855
those who are known are not the most dangerous i know it and appeal to your penetration				31099.10947462656
the burglary the day following that on which the conversation we have related took place the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil accompanied by ali and several attendants and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining				27023.291519714163
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder				1457.3468077841355
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter				673.7700687262209
the brother did not perceive this he had turned round to play with milady s favorite monkey which had pulled him by the doublet				7451.901246406166
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my father s brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse				18694.74189993376
perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself				767.7265160696846
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry				1705.352932172713
there is your money half in bank notes the other half in checks payable to bearer				8173.727642800865
if it was valentine alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were strangers he would listen to their conversation and might understand something of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery				6214.4499230141755
people fight for all sorts of reasons you know i fight in the cause of honor ah that is something serious so serious that i come to beg you to render me a service what is it to be my second that is a serious matter and we will not discuss it here let us speak of nothing till we get home				1608.5510206158544
there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going				2129.2429365259327
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first				1026.542232525767
yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only the young girl made a gesture of rage				1562.781144130883
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair				1232.163201042221
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat 6				31688.752277639906
desrues was however i must confess more skilful what would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we can				9347.206018187859
my young man said d artagnan drawing his sword that is an order sooner given than executed				4452.182702077387
de saint méran yes suddenly from an apoplectic stroke an apoplectic stroke repeated the doctor				1208.5465168486041
the next day they stopped at the hôtel de flandre at brussels				13522.209700587586
no said villefort burying his face in his hands no a hundred times no then you did not bury the poor child there sir				538.6666030299153
at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited				7242.329396806254
peppino passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him				50.346091714835126
sir said villefort have you any enemies at least that you know i have enemies replied dantès my position is not sufficiently elevated for that				539.176704063328
we will go on gentlemen said the queen				376.41246373663205
mercédès extended her hand to the count				289.53213610218774
there was a moment s silence and then a voice in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome sir				538.6684010266815
you will give your name to the captain who will bring you to me				126.06987768694972
he would not however yield immediately to the young man s request but made a few conscientious objections				26611.36315374421
are the oars in the boat everything is ready tis well mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match				14074.651593870984
gentlemen resumed aramis any one but the comte de la fere and myself would have had you arrested for we have friends in paris but we are contented with another course				2905.884292948405
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends aramis shook his head				426.9298201777028
no monsieur returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea				43239.71888706563
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet				49896.022610085085
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me besides i may not be there myself where at your ball why should you not be there because you have not yet invited me but i come expressly for that purpose you are very kind but i may be prevented if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments tell me what it is my mother begs you to come the comtesse de morcerf said monte cristo starting				39037.500826610456
julie was at the entrance of the garden where she was attentively watching penelon who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal roses				31293.92045271843
this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the rest i have reduced to mathematical terms				8744.910807205997
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead sea i think i can assist your researches said maximilian				1093.1967245271392
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines are you a surgeon asked de guiche				2476.290668199843
do you know what that warning was no i only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh machinations of the cardinal yes that s it no doubt said milady returning the letter to mme				194.5477368320324
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m de tréville the counsels being thrown into the bargain				8489.36789984623
i will make you all captains with good pensions				27899.934591417918
albert remarked this expressing his fears lest at the outset the parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point				1210.106936726923
and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes good he accepts said monte cristo				202.1432592490653
you will learn horsemanship swordsmanship in all its branches and dancing				11186.991450395797
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation				15550.392580688967
the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all paris				458.2816011101397
to horse my friends to horse and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to béthune				5711.702214729383
he questioned me concerning captain leclere s death and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris				458.2188885265704
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host				788.1979468897193
the story of ganymede maximilian is not a fable but an allegory when do you leave immediately the steamer waits and in an hour i shall be far from you				95.697167260298
he replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment				5770.416685507587
on his part the king returned to his apartment				938.8265254686945
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinal s				837.5940868137978
at length after occupying about an hour in these preparations he opened the door of the room in which the vicomte slept and entered				726.9856691178442
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you heyday cried d artagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell who s an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman				4483.628211186891
that man made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his countenance 20025m the englishman smiled imperceptibly				8748.355821694377
but that has passed away as suddenly as it came and is forgotten i can easily suppose sir that her majesty has forgotten it amid the fetes and the courtiers of the palais royal but i who have passed those years in the bastile ah				256.50758652577605
we are here to guard the gate and no one whom we do not know shall pass what is to be done said porthos				145.04002999540626
our athos who was as virtuous as scipio				30674.976608478795
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head				426.9290058744706
impossible the conversation had rested there and scarron through sheer obstinacy had seen monsieur de gondy only the more frequently				31077.91093114111
is it not true the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence				38204.3612167095
how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know but without doubt m de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home				1608.5510206158544
but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass she but who is she oh i remember said mme				194.55051987963722
do you know that i am growing old				1560.0605829164726
not before me behind me but with what asked the duke				666.2141948732849
monsieur said the count to albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise				1590.863398133179
here are five francs for his trouble indeed said louise i admire you and i could almost say respect you the laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark				4335.490016337983
ah my dear replied d artagnan upon that very horse i came to paris what does monsieur know this horse said mousqueton				1067.2202529017677
many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations				39759.603542397366
by his manner sir and his age he s the second to day has a young man such as i am gone through this morning then asked raoul				841.5125117903087
expenses on the road about fifty francs 50				24067.927995893067
she stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen why then do you always weep mother when i am away from you she said				496.5728964109112
that you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket but cried the bandit that is only another way of killing me				126.0576749727092
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard				711.5900846331654
faith i do not remember the name of the hotel at the hotel of said porthos by my faith nor do i remember it either it does not matter and a few of those bottles of old burgundy wine which cured your master so quickly of his sprain alas				2084.940574049135
now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber				720.0869216005509
one terrible idea pressed upon her mind that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again				391.97089577129276
porthos bowed as if in assent				2043.2750330716285
my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself				767.7228552731107
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls				36187.24068024681
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg				32608.68635190317
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact but the feeling in dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in provence or languedoc				31964.012882892464
you see m morrel said he we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador sailing with a fair breeze south south west after a week s calm when captain gaumard comes up to me i was at the helm i should tell you and says penelon what do you think of those clouds coming up over there i was just then looking at them myself				767.7206588035451
it was m de villefort and not the prefect who returned to the house of m de villefort				302.99188305116377
of all the exploits performed since their arrival in england by the extraordinary men with whom he had the honor to be associated this seemed without question to be the most wonderful				18237.399930738276
i beg your pardon said aramis noticing his awkwardness if i had known that i was to have the honor of your visit i should have procured the gardener s ladder but for me alone this is good enough sir said planchet when he saw d artagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you in case of necessity i might also climb up but my two horses can not mount the ladder take them to yonder shed my friend said aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find hay and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food				5397.59623620722
have you seen the king yes and all goes well we are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven it was then striking half past ten by st paul s				837.4994353139729
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle				5172.706211073317
you have conspired with your wife with madame de chevreuse and with my lord duke of buckingham indeed monseigneur responded the mercer i have heard her pronounce all those names and on what occasion she said that the cardinal de richelieu had drawn the duke of buckingham to paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen she said that cried the cardinal with violence				5225.590923754213
decidedly said danglars with the perspiration on his forehead i must be under arrest and he threw himself back in the calash not this time to sleep but to think				9801.217001943913
have you provided yourself with money				611.813570234165
because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father very well you are always the same athos great and generous				16362.030804235736
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman the most satisfactory part of the matter said d artagnan is that there remains no trace of it she had a son observed athos				152.84490488324786
the woman s lips seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a word she uttered				7578.374201469638
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker				3093.471782913906
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the gospel				32176.94341789813
a few minutes after twelve o clock bernouin knocked at the queen s bedroom door having come by the cardinal s secret corridor				4855.750024509512
are you waiting for him underneath these windows				1468.0480189081518
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed				13411.900206306851
is it broken off yesterday morning it appears franz declined the honor indeed				896.9266060778834
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion				16357.53745535138
suddenly d artagnan looked up and in his eyes there was a gleam which scarcely even porthos observed but it died away and he appeared more sorrowful than before				775.2110382336053

at last d artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and d artagnan s blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass				1119.8834331036

when he had passed one group he began to breathe more freely but he could not help observing that they turned round to look at him and for the first time in his life d artagnan who had till that day entertained a very good opinion of himself felt ridiculous				22586.36448222371

40152m as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect				6924.757514696473
that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized d artagnan by the arm and said if occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not yes my lord he replied				5913.108746235007

our magnificence makes you smile count said maximilian who had followed him with his eyes				492.3848920996549
but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of d artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer				997.7058070279057

adieu and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he said monte cristo forget not monte cristo and he fell back on the bed				692.0277953633112
most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same tone				778.7551816922775

now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring				51370.33079643003
an instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead				2464.619019666884
who knows but that in order to please madame de villefort and my father he may not persecute me by every means in his power				3632.611812846275

unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg 1 e 1				5010.924966482672
more pale and menacing than athos d artagnan stood on the threshold				3906.075605152876
after having deprived me of my liberty after having deprived me of death after having recalled me to existence my god have pity on me and do not let me die in despair 0193m who talks of god and despair at the same time said a voice that seemed to come from beneath the earth and deadened by the distance sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man s ears				2957.331266577444
caderousse terrified looked at the count				290.6660258437697
now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that i have a wife and four children rest assured put the gag in grimaud in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate				12305.491477607762
as he saw the abbé rise from his seat and go towards the door as though to ascertain if his horse were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey caderousse and his wife exchanged looks of deep meaning				1672.1945861303939
m coquenard had since the arrival of porthos frequently cast his eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his oak desk				4215.925310715779
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray				17383.040934068656

then d artagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful				39044.76116875314
in fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that i think monsieur de comminges must be mistaken what				670.0202972215177

patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent				60501.51350262395
at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes				14720.148278725828
his house has been full ever since				7419.897688728896
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the king s attorney and this king s attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly				5810.940047133232
my words have not convinced you				96.28290481272788

why this evening said the abbess today even				31320.373595469213
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron d épinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel				5058.3577266918055
in the first place i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in search of what proofs do you require did you in the year 1814 or 1815 know anything of a young sailor named dantès dantès				540.5959581896118
you are coming my boy oh you don t see straight said danglars he s gone right by the road to the vieilles infirmeries well said caderousse i should have sworn that he turned to the right how treacherous wine is come come said danglars to himself now the thing is at work and it will effect its purpose unassisted chapter 5				32895.0748250926
should dantès not return mercédès might one day be his				1113.1295316009075
then you know the men who are now on monte cristo oh yes we sailors are like freemasons and recognize each other by signs and do you think we have nothing to fear if we land nothing at all smugglers are not thieves but these two corsican bandits said franz calculating the chances of peril				17404.472600347573
another of the number continued the abbé without seeming to notice the emotion of caderousse is called danglars and the third in spite of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me a fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse who was about to break in upon the abbé s speech when the latter waving his hand said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards				7108.0706573270945
coquenard drew the dish toward her skillfully detached the two great black feet which she placed upon her husband s plate cut off the neck which with the head she put on one side for herself raised the wing for porthos and then returned the bird otherwise intact to the servant who had brought it in who disappeared with it before the musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment produces upon faces according to the characters and temperaments of those who experience it				88.82647959586254
we are not generally very severe with the austrians				36054.41125446289

alas dear mother said the young man i have unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it				88.82783499071867
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better friend than you and as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house				465.2865560116324
d artagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished				13347.030260785034
you know that the english laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage				16779.0152540113
well responded porthos you may imagine with the physique with which nature has endowed me i am not in want of good luck good lord how quickly men forget cried the procurator s wife raising her eyes toward heaven				741.5889886299171

they close it what then silence				715.6666822210756
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine the count s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words he stepped forward and touching the young man s shoulder said i was looking for you my friend monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly you see i was praying the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot				2199.0815154707243

i know them by their romantic imagination				2133.043554519195
he rushed headlong to the street and like the greek from marathon who fell in the square at athens with his laurel in his hand friquet reached councillor broussel s threshold and then fell exhausted scattering on the floor the louis disgorged by his leather bag				20580.186747247124

villefort s brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled dantès with apprehension				19315.033167923957
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day				483.1217848883031

oh sir exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time				473.9400501643588
all at once he raised his head his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice				2208.065378765445
no fifteen thousand are not enough i can not again become an honest man with less than thirty thousand francs no replied andrea dryly no i can not i do not think you understand me replied caderousse calmly i said without your laying out a sou do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good fortune and yours with mine and both of us to be dragged down there again it would make very little difference to me said caderousse if i were retaken i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again andrea did more than tremble this time he turned pale				675.7978116800447

he was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at villeroy				16370.396712270453

hence it resulted when d artagnan proceeded to draw his sword in earnest he found himself purely and simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in length which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard				4366.88587621862
we must pierce through the corridor by forming a side opening about the middle as it were the top part of a cross				18571.189067984677

there was a great press of people in m de villefort s antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name				579.4692058089001

the blow so they tell me at least was struck with a master s hand mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain				9060.331224247031
and how many men had he with him i do not know sire answered the minister of police				10558.12831362536

all is well we may sleep tranquilly on this assurance the two friends fell asleep and d artagnan who was very weary bade good night to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him				50.3382780794138
but you will remain you are not afraid said d artagnan coming back to recommend courage to his lackey				2786.7292163580087

i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied d artagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos another i disarmed or wounded i don t remember which wounded said athos it was a phenomenon of skill the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose				4241.683376736598

this parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs				8243.705664214942
oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me i am yet living and extending his hand towards the table he seized a knife				3837.7798228783918
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man				179.07235051394656
two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden				1366.472484288964
d artagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past eight				2987.728836203644
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give				29446.628534897558
adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme				194.54847897416764
all at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of d artagnan				80.11467863748251
there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles did you ever see mercédès again inquired the priest				2034.1030709241197
friend porthos said d artagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and i of my captaincy				41657.73385698538
d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or looking indeed as if he had never seen them before				775.2102989351009
it was situated in the via dei banchi near st peter s				837.5932880222106

during this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease				4641.115021877859
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d artagnan and porthos				145.03920007207194
to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beauty it was too much for a visionary it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours				47899.26643392975
and pray upon what shall i make my campaign upon grimaud i have brought you another said d artagnan				80.11616851590783

pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague is in fact unlimited said monte cristo				202.1432592490653
in the meanwhile the promises of m de tréville went on prosperously				46735.89778366092
i am willing to help rebuild your fortune but i will not be an accomplice in the ruin of others but since i tell you cried danglars that with these three million do you expect to recover your position sir without touching those three million i hope so if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit shall you be able to pay m cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs you promise for my dowry he shall receive them on returning from the mayor s20 very well what next				22077.948738216917

but this is not to the purpose our business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in peace all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium				12918.656721916625
go then and set about this work in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me				126.05731431932409

m andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari				36048.497662932095
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes				2682.182992832757
a sorrowful smile passed over his face he asked himself what had become of mercédès who must believe him dead				624.8701505419197
he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him				50.33877014662891
the worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to him				50.33985031104246
but don t think yourselves in a better position than you are				1193.205031750195
nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold				3906.910122057821

franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction				6181.438071331509
one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event				11204.277492235573
will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn				1019.4923917484341

yes sir answered mousqueton but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it				88.83592543390488
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheard of that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs				35565.44471081766

porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m de tréville and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies from the lawyer s dame to the baroness there was question of nothing less with porthos than a foreign princess who was enormously fond of him				50.3382780794138
he rushed toward d artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms				513.9634808752786
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger				1409.9242732631992
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet d artagnan				80.11605390889143
how is that you asked me for five hundred men did you not				591.6919050330797

next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the louvre inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of m de tréville which proved to be in the rue du vieux colombier that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by d artagnan a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey				1052.1575420667828
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind				473.56347081143144
yes i know it because yesterday monsieur de wardes in a saloon where i was showed a ring which he said he had received from you wretch cried milady				406.598741136024
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance				43235.884052457506
in the meantime d artagnan took his way toward the rue tiquetonne where he lived at the hotel de la chevrette				14069.404322459193
only continued m d avrigny with a slow and solemn tone if anyone falls ill in your house if you feel yourself attacked do not send for me for i will come no more				1128.3794307151104

this evening your destiny begins to change amen exclaimed d artagnan stopping the carriage				673.4109749716471
a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there				485.7516842363379
at this moment comminges rushed into the room				219.6150455458651
and you obeyed father that woman was a monster				13812.325328002153

dantès saw the light gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his hand				231.95673010417846
then you will lie here said d artagnan				80.25297325158184
he had good cause to do so the pain i gave him must have been atrocious				35798.54253786152
by the word of a gentleman you shall have no cause to repent of your confidence well monsieur you understand that uneasiness makes us do many things what have you done oh nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor well monsieur porthos gave us a note for his duchess ordering us to put it in the post				2066.429146819148
yes much about how much a thousand pistoles perhaps what you demand of me is serious then it is indeed what must be done you must go away immediately				1383.8186847210964
he alone could have transmitted to lord de winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of fatalities				53052.328856794156
ah my head oh what agony shall i suffer like this long no no friend replied the doctor you will soon cease to suffer ah i understand you said the unhappy man				179.0427232074142

the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters				29862.17749597778
it is you who stabbed selim				5032.907692719277
good thought d artagnan a quarter of an hour to go to the tent a quarter of an hour to return it is more than we need then turning without the least change of countenance to porthos he said looking him full in the face friend porthos listen to this first not a syllable to either of our friends of what you have heard it is unnecessary for them to know the service we are going to render them very well i understand go to the stable you will find mousqueton there saddle your horses put your pistols in your saddle bags take out the horses and lead them to the street below this so that there will be nothing to do but mount them all the rest is my business porthos made no remark but obeyed with the sublime confidence he had in his friend				526.2227798804357
you will go to london continued the cardinal				410.37240331773074
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle				6702.705264798443
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions				43607.33012828536
he knew his time well the hour when valentine was giving noirtier his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious duty				3595.389084306641
he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other				472.0067985217686
what reason do you assign my reason replied the young girl				991.2244925811586
they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass				2388.7348506922535
come father added dantès put this money back in your box unless neighbor caderousse wants anything and in that case it is at his service no my boy no said caderousse				528.750855984908
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferry boats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to post paris presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions				54626.87879888137
porthos made a thousand flourishes asking bicarat what o clock it could be and offering him his compliments upon his brother s having just obtained a company in the regiment of navarre but jest as he might he gained nothing				712.482357078624
or rather at what he said and what was he saying he said this madame mazarin is a stumbling block				9085.328352426355
noirtier resumed m d avrigny in the same pitiless tone m				666.6269834158516
chance for once seemed to favor them in sending what they were so assiduously seeking				11295.212550452223
like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal gift she brought misfortune upon everything she touched				12712.587208478932
i wish you to do so said he				208.9636315111378
until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods				37512.47192964892
but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten that				539.18904497995
between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover				64585.77067232574
that door is guarded d artagnan you know that very well you will force it said porthos				145.04632373524612
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace				957.6714969931945
she will however be in the salon in ten minutes it is a great honor to me returned monte cristo to be thus on the first day of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a man whose merit equals his reputation and to whom fortune has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshal s staff to offer you oh replied morcerf reddening slightly i have left the service monsieur				1109.4334803090494
lean upon me and let us return to the camp yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged you have my word said he for the second time i give you your life the wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but d artagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his gratitude				1693.9821556616157
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didn t mean mischief that s my opinion too said the captain and i ll take precautions accordingly				16913.501720274027
he took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote my dear marshal in an hour lens will be in the enemy s possession				2384.9664729591536
in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relation to my own				1169.3477047113192
the sound had not yet died away when signor pastrini himself entered				727.0525763761598
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them i learned it all but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love forgive me replied morrel i will go away no said valentine you might meet someone stay but if anyone should come here the young girl shook her head				426.9290058744706
how delightful to see you again dear friend he cried in a voice which was now changed from a baritone into a bass you ve not then forgotten me forget you				95.69712162834361
hence that immense fortune which in lord wilmore s opinion possibly amounted to one or two millions per annum a precarious fortune which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine				1527.858866424938
ah yes mazarin bit his lips as he spoke i know your devotion to her majesty i have been a captain in the queen s guards for twenty years was the reply				1028.4834388112777
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel				5548.551125874496
i know that name a son of monsieur de broussel s servant and a lad that i promise you in a revolt will not give away his share to the dogs is he not a singing boy at notre dame asked d artagnan				80.11383820546554
this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable distance perhaps on account of the darkness of the night which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned				41863.35486579669
thank you said monte cristo now you must permit me to take my leave of you you said before that you were obliged to leave us monsieur said madame de villefort and you were about to tell us why when your attention was called to some other subject indeed madame said monte cristo i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going nonsense say on well then it is to see a thing on which i have sometimes mused for hours together what is it a telegraph				13487.69312755192

god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or space				15605.970732163983
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles				4343.833479653029
he then thought with a touch of vexation that perhaps the young woman had fallen asleep while waiting for him				50.33983830908831
if bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape				1432.1191551728598
sire said winter who in this trying emergency felt all his strength and energy fire up we are ready the king looked at the three gentlemen				1703.0434522108494
he touched him on the shoulder				1457.7867567082749
the authorities were not in a condition to cope with serious revolt				22754.721096706166
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us				454.06586462891465

thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse				507.7627567330068
at that moment buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe worked with gold in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls				18545.313824588797
no my child no said madame de saint méran but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your father my father inquired valentine uneasily				5288.721603991917
i must however do him the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion because he thought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one				372.0571068957612
he knows that we were sent from france by monsieur mazarin he will consider us as brothers				9532.65400096183
i wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit				18022.074486504403

the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the spaniard it had just gained another over the people				1043.322643113174
that s all that is necessary said athos now for my idea i should like however to comprehend said porthos				145.04224314751454

do you hear not a single creature				41454.46693692111
50049m at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention				886.0756155873412
there was only this blow wanting then he said aloud my dear friend your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile				49949.15524327821
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal				39616.53262060881
it was mousqueton who having no straw to lie upon had helped himself to that of the horses				903.4713263368437
danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror				1755.3444080770346
by the orders of the deputy procureur i believe so the conviction that they came from m de villefort relieved all dantès apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort				6532.6678650326885
general said the president do not alarm yourself you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us a significant silence followed these words and as the general did not reply close the doors said the president to the door keeper				10779.406219107277
at least d artagnan said to himself as he took the road to villars cotterets at least i shall not be alone in my undertaking				40230.502380074984
i have been looking for him but without success he will be here tonight in what part of the house in the baroness s box i believe that charming young woman with her is her daughter yes i congratulate you morcerf smiled				559.2722105077514

he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow				74562.55602056478
he is saved cried dantès in a paroxysm of delight				4294.000186672614
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely				17601.13537633937
lord de winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it				88.82783499071867
on entering his hôtel m de tréville thought it best to be first in making the complaint				17998.80088528862
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven o clock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity				1957.577473903969
yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows				19648.82276015698
that was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of february				9876.572318835444
morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been				3336.4011673613545
surely the diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that no replied the abbé it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself				929.7166619735915
now mazarin was alone and defenceless as he well knew				6925.33208334688
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do				915.9288249797196
i know because it is my office to know everything				1025.4385289907932
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her				164.27416187265285
at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry				22408.758047473642
franz thanked the count for his attention				887.0475073842812
this cavalier is my attendant would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours demanded the host				788.1983227318781
mademoiselle eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d armilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events				13206.95267544613
it was thought rather dear but people wanted to sleep and who would not give even two or three louis for a few hours of sound sleep				1402.5543064428848
ah said he involuntarily following noirtier s eyes which were fixed on madame de villefort who repeated this poor child would be better in bed				692.0291153028393
you do not know the italian nobility the cavalcanti are all descended from princes have they any fortune an enormous one what do they do try to spend it all				335.64125633092425
here your excellency said peppino taking the fowl from the young bandit and placing it on the worm eaten table which with the stool and the goat skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell				2068.4658834127667
yes monsieur a most excellent sister married nearly nine years happy asked the count again				391.99145600218577
felton give me that knife and at these words as if all her strength was exhausted milady sank weak and languishing into the arms of the young officer who intoxicated with love anger and voluptuous sensations hitherto unknown received her with transport pressed her against his heart all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth bewildered by the contact with that palpitating bosom				2964.2152329576825
i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you but i shall lodge here no longer				3296.553037776096
it was necessary that d artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber				720.0821145177773
the keeper was so stupefied at this scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions den to something more substantial than mere fascination				22484.602347053096
we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke				51411.59741845205
monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around				2223.042733883086
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris				458.21714056356325
in the morning i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus				40960.41240421569
from that time d artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them and he therefore placed in the pocket of mme				194.54912835085833
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest d artagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the bastille go to				6945.856235121053
at nine o clock then be ready here at the hôtel i will come and take you planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse				507.53787692619136
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name than mine a name				579.4739031395782
prison had made edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk whatever				10589.782310032382
and who d artagnan and his friends indeed they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to the bastille why is it not done already what would you				95.69707599641096
amongst the catalans mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any				5264.321077577107
dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him				50.33877014662891
all at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers she counted two then five then eight horsemen				6422.764260628028
oh monsieur i thank you with all my heart adieu count said the abbé d herblay i return to my convent adieu abbé said the coadjutor i am to preach to morrow and have twenty texts to examine this evening adieu gentlemen said the count i am going to sleep twenty four hours i am just falling down with fatigue the three men saluted one another whilst exchanging a last look				945.3816666827512
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugénie and the arrest of benedetto villefort having retired as well as noirtier and d avrigny her thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard				711.3112243357243
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better				1072.6757129708574
the bearer of this letter will tell you madame what i dare not trust to pen and paper and the risks of transit				47148.78767984049
all the same i should like to do him that service what do you say to it i will tell the coadjutor said bazin				4661.457624681503
the chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence in order to take a trip to hyères for a week				4136.3025495118545
anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy				755.8420401288818
now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure				1281.0466282418797
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued d artagnan with his frank expression				1763.2964162267265
you are right sir said athos				153.4911282376941
as for winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were petrified				63318.20910085363
it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen				6042.761580016618
he had started the previous evening and had only returned an hour since				7431.171500836088
dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles				1473.148804221442
aramis whistled for bazin but bazin was asleep in the ante chamber and aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him				50.33877014662891
the horses started on a trot and took the road to the louvre which they entered				726.9953754884955
never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their father s neck				8833.937904869954
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu				5579.614258618922
you can not be speaking seriously athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to london				2250.842667905536
and why not because you will look into yourself and you will do justice to the lady i should do her justice by sending her to tyburn said buckingham				1341.802146872704
as soon as that important business is concluded i will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars i dare not return with those dreadful horses said madame de villefort				302.98523714578164
has anything particular happened in the neighborhood				13834.683896872308
it is no nonsense it is quite true				1082.8295209436042
athos always carried the key of this coffer about him but he one day opened it before porthos and porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing but letters and papers love letters and family papers no doubt				6752.041956844642
these steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards appeared				1102.864600388482
he and she the queen and the duke cried richelieu				5579.48655284487
and now my dear girl said d artagnan you know that it is not good for any of us to be here				688.9966153846389
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth				2400.5095309625995
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king				424.998600706985
he was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by love				978.3141930328643
but the king is asleep i have something important to reveal to him can it not be put off till to morrow he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late come then said lord winter				673.7556113441138
the notary she exclaimed let him come in the notary who was at the door immediately entered				726.9922555695102
listen then to the supplication of a despairing woman				932.0621366858829
it is a mercy to let me die for if i live i shall lose my reason and become mad				3621.567036326762
franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read 40038m extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques held february 5th 1815 franz stopped				2091.7249170448113
i had acted hastily towards him				50.719601163086516
fatality meantime milady drunk with passion roaring on the deck like a lioness that has been embarked had been tempted to throw herself into the sea that she might regain the coast for she could not get rid of the thought that she had been insulted by d artagnan threatened by athos and that she had quit france without being revenged on them				157.705445920603
since the moment he had first received these two mementoes athos had never parted with them				157.71567342729213
if you make a single step to find her you are lost that s pretty positive continued d artagnan but after all it is but a menace yes but that menace terrifies me				126.05731431932409
well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature and he withdrew sighing				5062.257041728699
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded				2556.1638865838822
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played but i can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault				4125.952830687884
he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels				12049.243126346104
her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly edmond edmond edmond chapter 113				38053.529365875125
for three days the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered with ice				8241.921226420465
the point was then to discover the hidden entrance				5937.84868700834
he even thought he could perceive something on the ground at a distance he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh				1081.7112044518617
i also have made my preparations this morning oh heavens				5202.062075938978
his whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness only an unusual fire beamed from his eyes like the effects of a fever his brow was more pale than it generally was his teeth were clenched and his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark was at work within him				50.3382780794138
milady gazed with all the power of her attention it was just light enough for her to see who was coming				4701.204519669247
ah if you could but help me if we could both together defeat their plan				1525.3351053696265
you would follow the escort exclaimed porthos in dismay				30321.997418797706
porthos came down at once to the threshold of the hotel				3446.3600348259997
you have no enemy here there is no one but fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond and offered him his hand				231.95319075236537
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report				3119.39670230686
to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow				1440.9088328214343
you should furnish him with some of course replied monte cristo				202.20312594050395
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself				264.2384313980818
under what circumstances did we meet he asked again				392.20235406690205
the sword of the guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now useless weapon and passed through the thigh of the assassin who fell				4021.2453565643277
alas said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim				13188.04833053826
you know about that cried athos astonished				2520.6643452043713
why if my information prove correct a sort of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered can i believe my ears cried the marquise				3895.9712600988205
mordaunt put his hand into the hat took out one of the three papers and disdainfully dropped it on the table without reading it				88.82758085260778
soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos d artagnan became hourly more in love with milady				406.598741136024
athos and aramis charged at the head of their squadrons aramis with sword and pistol in his hands athos with his sword in his scabbard his pistol in his saddle bags calm and cool as if on the parade except that his noble and beautiful countenance became sad as he saw slaughtered so many men who were sacrificed on the one side to the obstinacy of royalty and on the other to the personal rancor of the princes				8294.04855630264
have you never seen anyone enter your room at night oh yes i have frequently seen shadows pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i thought i was under the influence of delirium then you do not know who it is that attempts your life 50073m no said valentine who could desire my death you shall know it now then said monte cristo listening				60962.60128884643
to crown his happiness monsieur de chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence la ramee was deputy governor of the chateau				4708.365503163614
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear monsieur does me wrong said planchet i thought he had seen me at work yes but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left only i beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening i hope so monsieur well then i count on you at the appointed hour i shall be ready only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said d artagnan and nodding to planchet he went out				528.1141120933847
where then could he be if he had entered his mother s room and not since returned				1438.4374706723977
mazarin especially yes do you know i am very glad to hear you give that testimony the cardinal has some good in him and if he were not a foreigner well he would be more justly estimated				50586.256289636294
some traveller seems impatient said the host				789.0606003231678
do you say that m noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m le baron franz d épinay yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders				2126.679827223054
under the cuirass the hump will not be seen				3035.916349301929
all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human				21940.25795847131
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation				5696.66624586925
read me something m debray she said				497.5263943500957
madame said athos passing his arm under that of d artagnan we abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman				931.7577437265907
we must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible				849.4291479621968
i swear before god who seeth us and who in the darkness of this night heareth us never shall my sword cross yours never my eye express a glance of anger nor my heart a throb of hatred at you				95.69698473261094
you are the son of my aunt consequently my cousin you come from noyon in picardy you have several lawsuits and no attorney				5906.610345194319
yours affectionate de tréville well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me athos to the waters of forges there or elsewhere in the king s service either the king s or the queen s				837.4990359632174
you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself				929.7210952186715
request him to come here directly				7977.655063204584
he is a worthy honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody				7401.2048160430495
forsooth i don t know half a pistole if you can find out said d artagnan				80.11880452253459
my lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me but does he not approach the walls while playing your eminence doesn t know those walls they are sixty feet high and i doubt if monsieur de beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable				37154.689298479934

who are you who are you said the voice				412.9792896916883
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for god s sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us				454.0333884688875

kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep sigh				1081.6967621455665

the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair do you really think so				430.4635830704837

madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless and how was m de saint méran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count				288.84445045090274

to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when d artagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure				2629.9637499737446

the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done oh m de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint méran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles				1472.561671308584

and now where is he gone inquired d artagnan				80.19192139661388
bad weather observed one of the bearers not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea why yes the abbé runs a chance of being wet said the other and then there was a burst of brutal laughter				2707.2868744992766
d artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described				4139.210804655468
and what is it to you replied the king we are not of the same religion all men are brothers said the puritan				4668.157376428848
silence said d artagnan pressing her hand more closely				5045.311118708056

they found him holding his leave of absence in one hand and m de tréville s note in the other				472.0079238750124
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man				179.0576643198803
any other person would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister although he saw that dandré was irrevocably lost				1014.4607453301521
but why the devil dost thou run about the tops of houses at seven o clock of the morning in the month of january sir said planchet you must know but perhaps you ought not to know tell us what returned d artagnan but first put a napkin against the window and draw the curtains sir said the prudent planchet in the first place are you on good terms with monsieur de rochefort perfectly one of my dearest friends ah				256.50758652577605

scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him				50.33836209054904
if my mother could know of this attention on your part and i will venture to tell her i am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry the count laughed				6233.384440394742
then they knelt on each side of the grave and said the prayers of the dead				624.8844528483238
cardinalists or frondeurs what matters it				89.97490447100496
during the scene of tumult andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly then leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly				3929.828145538735
still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance				1217.614127870982

at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking				39650.625987544365
you must hope for us both maximilian that will make me at least partly happy but why must you leave me so soon i do not know particulars				13097.703447220034
nevertheless it was the rendezvous of the great world and all paris went there				485.7577065094395

if it is a workman i need but knock against the wall and he will cease to work in order to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the governor he will soon resume it				88.82652195163874
bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress and disappeared with the lightness of a bird				8262.075566581012

when we went up to the enemy it was slowly we were forbidden to draw first and we were marching toward the spaniards who were on a height with lowered muskets				4863.7725664063655
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first which must much diminish the face value of your bill monsieur porthos and render yours almost null monsieur aramis				151.46885407360074
the court of his hôtel situated in the rue du vieux colombier resembled a camp from by six o clock in the morning in summer and eight o clock in winter				673.7559326159014
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family				1594.9384049405
it seems to me said d artagnan with a thousand livres each i do not speak as a spartan but as a procurator this word procurator roused porthos				145.03926923216844

in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another				581.0970340998375
he then inquired how they had fared in their trip				55239.76548451086

this double error became an irresistible reality and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hiding place and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming valentine at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl he crossed the flower garden which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orange trees which extended in front of the house he reached the step ran quickly up and pushed the door which opened without offering any resistance				2622.4176044714927

long life to the great cardinal the cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of m bonacieux and then when bonacieux s cries were no longer audible good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city				1258.412322574059

the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville				1861.2997686856113

who sent away madame de chevreuse after she had been persecuted twelve years under the last reign a woman of intrigue who wanted to keep up against me the spirit of cabal she had raised against m de richelieu who dismissed madame de hautefort that friend so loyal that she refused the favor of the king that she might remain in mine a prude who told you every night as she undressed you that it was a sin to love a priest just as if one were a priest because one happens to be a cardinal who ordered monsieur de beaufort to be arrested an incendiary the burden of whose song was his intention to assassinate me you see cardinal replied the queen that your enemies are mine that is not enough madame it is necessary that your friends should be also mine my friends monsieur the queen shook her head				426.9290058744706

have the goodness to send mine to athos s residence				5070.311292376937
not the first prince of the blood not the king s uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the blood not the prince nearest to the throne not the king s uncle i repeat but the murderer of chalais of montmorency and of cinq mars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversary instead of a man who threatened a man who smiles				5644.24372321873
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady s forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed or upon my soul i will blow your brains out with another man milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew athos				152.84483200113513

danglars meditated an escape but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed				3828.859824566977
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot				2199.1077307214914

the abbé told me it was worth 50 000 francs muttered caderousse				528.8386038284526
i say sire that the minister of police is greatly deceived or i am and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty it is probable that i am in error				9238.395873364958
i know it will serve me as it did when we came over and to think said mousqueton that we have nothing to fight seasickness with but barley bread and hop beer				13712.877337055861

ten other carriages followed containing the ladies of honor the officers of the royal household and the court				908.0931920503845

madame de villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them				157.70559632030805

they carried a banner on which could be read this strange device we are seeking our king the next following days were occupied in trivial movements which resulted only in the carrying off of a few herds of cattle and the burning of two or three houses				29031.102866477835
there was a moment s silence it was evident that the doctor was examining the dead body				892.1458661645987
a night is soon passed and tomorrow to the wheel to the gallows				29448.116944659825
from the top of an eminence d artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur				26819.33692102683
23 germain pillon was a famous french sculptor 1535 1598				49580.35019396057

i am indeed to be pitied				14060.497836706358
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles				1472.564479999753
today is the twentieth of september				3892.0348330988804
at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound				2349.6934181002325
monte cristo watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small opening so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the drawing room now occupied by cavalcanti and andrea				3040.92060986872
7 prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no				412.8432377123197

after all continued d artagnan there was certainly one with aramis				151.52866899064972
at five o clock precisely the count arrived before the house at auteuil followed by ali				11202.290215403616
d artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen				3037.054405808477
france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence				2212.2376978637267
at this moment he will have left elba to go whither i know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples or on the coast of tuscany or perhaps on the shores of france				587.9636435892135
in fact four men such as they were four men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives four men always supporting one another never yielding executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common four arms threatening the four cardinal points or turning toward a single point must inevitably either subterraneously in open day by mining in the trench by cunning or by force open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain however well it might be defended or however distant it may seem				40333.495372623554
we are about to ascertain sire replied d artagnan as he rapidly left the room				219.2772674290269
faithful to his mission of vengeance athos had requested to be conducted to the garden and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest				3205.9490564994244
it is magnificent said cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words				832.9917569423741
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back				804.0711247468978
d artagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other				472.0065734514418

sir cried the man in the name of heaven put your sword back into the sheath and don t kill me unheard				33424.72970439794
the next day was spent as usual				2903.4881352710204
good bye said château renaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his right				1369.6774733870338
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking it it was the noise of cannon				9952.431063465492
she must live that my infamy may diminish hers and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage				673.3782228158312
yes said athos it reminds me of a family jewel it is beautiful is it not said d artagnan				80.11597750430492
dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions				9435.919413308238
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving care of a devoted family but he had convinced himself by a course of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the world even life itself				1888.6656087901092
henceforth we have nothing to fear				1178.8213865824828
sir said d avrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentine s maid if you please villefort went himself to find her and d avrigny approached noirtier				1719.869378106592
my god said valentine raising both her hands to heaven with a sublime expression i have done my utmost to remain a submissive daughter i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my tears				1908.7484289360523
now my young friend said he england is all our own				1169.278565789234
yes sir he said in a softened tone				779.0478521272786
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefort s valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness				58052.04589083734
but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon				4432.191166164351
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after albert s departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy				35171.68369228051
do you refuse said mercédès in a tremulous voice				412.96944361551846
come hither monsieur d artagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating air				1218.7352087196157
progress of cavalcanti the younger chapter 77				48303.49739367671
we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce i believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain it is my intention so to do come let us hear you				95.69693910074358
when luigi had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded man				179.0484433717511
i shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign i shall begin to exterminate bravo thought d artagnan on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos				152.84483200113513
and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve				7035.772285173249
speak gentlemen said the prince saluting them first speak we shall have time afterward for the usual compliments				23868.94951358012
i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms				8744.87744808228
ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving d artagnan how glad i am to see you why so planchet asked the young man				179.04417457509342
then when they had thus passed the day in building castles in the air they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble position				2935.120377885029
thus richard iii for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of edward iv				1175.2910377930423
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no doubt you did not expect to find here that is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable beds ma foi my dear sir replied franz make no apologies				33928.791296676296
follow me mr commissary said the brigadier tread in my steps wait an instant said the host number 3 has two staircases inside and outside good said the brigadier				14067.190587760608

go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this charles rose and turned toward parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture				36407.11885869339
ask m de morcerf into the drawing room said he to baptistin while he led the beautiful greek girl to a private staircase				2584.9574165201125
has not some sage said nothing too much				1265.920351857148
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak				2791.9031077876357
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign				5183.590147369088
yes count and charged with a commission for which i beg of you to accept my excuses what is it be so good as to give me up your sword count athos smiled and opened the window				533.2705492730045
the mountaineers are bonapartists sire then murmured louis he was well informed				22789.03387863423
this can not be the establishment of athos				153.03327540665492
at the end of half an hour or thereabouts a clerk came to put an end to his tortures but not to his anxiety by giving the order to conduct m bonacieux to the chamber of examination				6569.21543932838
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc				35918.71227164542
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head				426.9290058744706
come i am a good sort of a prince added he and although i like not puritans i do them justice and it is the same with puritanesses when they are pretty				9438.259389840066
the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass				9377.67971708653
true they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue				16448.58050629514
he was discovered all hope of flight was gone				2978.8891009973154
four of the guards who were constantly near the prisoner assisted in picking up the tennis balls				4296.142446510727
ali returned a sign in the negative				6865.477974069243
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief				6007.326533253392
i thought i had been deceived had mistaken the spot				2746.078498794104
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education				61535.909329124646
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death				781.2255279552935
and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night grief has stunned him replied d avrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur s study				2366.368151651342
the breakfast at m de tréville s was as gay and cheerful as possible				849.4781591411916
what are you thinking of asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder				4127.826227925868
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me bravo cried château renaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism				28541.930316807717
he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head				426.9440707356878
the secret is said athos that i saw milady last night d artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips but at the name of milady his hand trembled so that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents you saw your wi hush interrupted athos				152.84483200113513
one of the bandits rose and offered him a glass filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair rita at this moment carlini heard a woman s cry he divined the truth seized the glass broke it across the face of him who presented it and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came				6157.520965814685
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan				17663.739800032854
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eugénie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone haydée may hear you perhaps and you think she would be angry no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression				1763.2871673932086
i could interpret one of your looks then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown instantly but on my part said milady how should i repay such a service				1104.875845617852
but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips				448.3125675260103
such as you see me i am a sort of philosopher and one day perhaps i shall go to paris to rival monsieur appert and the man in the little blue cloak and will that be the first time you ever took that journey yes it will				1730.438334204477
acknowledge that if albert is brave he can not be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise doubtless doubtless said morrel but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday you will breakfast with me will you not morrel said the count to turn the conversation				1078.255716800704
d artagnan started on seeing these tears				1907.2217876430504
suppose her majesty refuses oh said d artagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs				14465.97411154034
the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the nave				36116.7003396365
athos was pale and trembled in every limb				28778.546714232874
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose				14412.42150694956
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with d artagnan on one side porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan				80.11387640672959
now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine he is a very rich englishman eccentric almost to insanity and his real name is lord wilmore ah indeed				896.9171969926891
in that case let there be no more question of what s past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar				37524.207860459115
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders so they tell me monseigneur do you know why no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man				179.04246708492744
certainly said andrea i shall not overtake my friend but i shall kill your horse therefore i had better stop				3102.4680901224924
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking said the man i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a chance to speak to beppo and who is beppo oh beppo is employed in the prison and i give him so much a year to let me know what is going on within his holiness s castle indeed				896.9171969926891
royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns				11264.521936331439
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection				13652.969232683366
it frequently occurs in a state prison like this that persons are stationed outside the doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the prisoners but they believe i am shut up alone here that makes no difference and you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get here i do that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine only unfortunately i did not curve aright for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion instead of taking an ellipsis of forty feet i made it fifty				50750.20927332325
as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name				579.516457164133
her pretty face arrested my attention i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her				164.27651185019658
if d artagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is				2027.5645948409574
as to that cried d artagnan after a moment of reflection i shall surmount it be assured how so i will go this very evening to tréville whom i will request to ask this favor for me of his brother in law monsieur dessessart but another thing what asked d artagnan seeing that mme				194.54755129694092

i gave her good advice by which she did not profit				52211.501779876344
why what do you mean by that question i mean that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these				16960.97420656622
you can not at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement				3957.127637127347
that monsieur d artagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king				425.04278182051996
a cry more prolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy				5382.514437615055
one more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throw only one the last done for twenty replied groslow				1420.6362466066769

all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of aramis				151.49673586695357

a propos monseigneur continued tréville addressing the cardinal monsieur de cahusac is quite recovered is he not thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger				1783.5984549190216

bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at d artagnan hatefully				45063.84636422069
d artagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and listened				6071.540294389195
but said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of kitty i must not play the fool				36657.16287211083
franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent				21293.33368421172
but why did she return to tours without telling me anything because she was in fear of being arrested why has she not written to me then because she was afraid of compromising you d artagnan you restore me to life cried aramis				151.46885407360074
and now that you have obtained what you want go said she monsieur de gondy whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows i am at her command ah cursed priest cried anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day i will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me to day mazarin wished to approach her				164.27416187265285
imponite manus and not manum place the hands not the hand place the hands repeated the curate with a gesture				3262.615154916527
milady followed him with her eyes and made a gesture of satisfaction				6180.659969916213
the queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious				16372.926056008011
he was called count he was said to possess 50 000 livres per annum and his father s immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme				47127.1646728832
but cried felton that is a fleur de lis which i see there and therein consisted the infamy replied milady				406.6010677193394
can i be of any use to you chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow				1893.6199146251652
this is what i propose to do said athos				152.9433274342535
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some house				465.28677787760444
how much in that little bag seven thousand livres in louis of twelve francs seven thousand livres cried porthos				145.0431422502048
i know the french as well as if i had made them myself				767.7506777648753
you will deliver this letter to milady				407.1120750608016
see how deadly pale he is				2024.5030618760857
the left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to lower				39742.999052388914
but contrary to all expectation when the 31st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision				8646.15403374148
30193m excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap i am not up there i know but i have only just come down do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i had twenty one five more than last year				1820.361089348248
i have already forbidden that man he said to come in here without my permission you must pardon him my lord said la ramee for i directed him to come and why did you so direct when you know that he displeases me my lord will remember that it was agreed between us that he should wait upon us at that famous supper				2624.111282341761
the shutter where eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed				692.0297752735474
the breeze had been so light all night they had made but little progress				10401.381060005968
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination				6569.21543932838
he spoke in a voice of the procureur general with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law				2552.1155588227757
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought d artagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence there reigned a perfect stillness in the house				465.28677787760444
one evening i went according to custom to a house which i frequented with much pleasure when one is young what can be expected one is weak				37180.28107556125
well where the devil are you going now cried athos				152.90664851513722
the snow deadened the noise of his fall				1751.2561805405412
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you				95.71907311046454
i have no greater regard for the bastille than you				95.74545805974714
tell me how tréville you know how i delight in accounts of war and fighting and louis xiii				1413.51086458394
i thought there were four of you listen to me sir				538.734931126234
the abbess introduced them to each other				472.8508910866195
this wine will give you strength drink and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically				20052.533092843016
poor fernand has been dismissed continued caderousse				529.3888724589007
come then and take a turn with me and i will explain the hostess who knew d artagnan s skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair				3516.9854558153656
they search her she resists they use force the scoundrels in spite of his prudence d artagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below				2988.0508267418877
you are welcome monsieur said milady in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill humor which d artagnan had just remarked you have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude the englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail				12472.375940455602
upon my word child exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds				51069.141390319644
my father died but i did not die				1384.5909318370325
after a moment s silence the lady inquired do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium				9816.10899689279
it is quite wonderful said albert				435.80719660025846
two royal pages were playing with him				50.54617754444966
i once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss				8751.501729204
the host proved to be a worthy man as bald as a chinaman				66933.82555779381
but how comes the diamond in your possession sir				538.8582518787555
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself				264.2608601189932
he took them up just as he formerly used to take up the stones from the road and threw them out of the house neat remarked d artagnan				80.11410561469643
the matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for kitty				2956.493746923519
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos quietly				2383.1293999788923
my good charles i particularly recommend to your care planchet the laquais of monsieur d artagnan				80.11872811532488
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation				4079.4321293585417
danglars was engaged at that moment presiding over a railroad committee				39776.21496970534
he had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting maid poor kitty				2956.4909273927105
whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve abandon the exterior the material appearance for the invisible principle for the invisible principle is everything				1025.3426958991083
i faith said d artagnan to raoul you were just in time to stay my hand				231.96524689080735
it is not true said milady in a tone of voice so firm and with a countenance so unchanged that if d artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have doubted				17208.54652462861
the banker uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor exclaimed				2392.3734268840913
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped but athos cried d artagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty				3157.2991097564245
in fifteen or twenty days i shall set out for la rochelle with the army but on the eve of my departure a vessel which i shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south				12777.249015456868
certainly neither i nor fernand said danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner				6409.046176273885
yes he appears to be a resolute fellow well he will do more than he has promised he will do wonders then the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs				1250.7615359291262
in that case felton would escape her for in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary				3524.835993939783
one of the two guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after that				539.1769611628765
where are you come from sir				540.6191585490735
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended				11460.849160128877
cloud and not elsewhere before the d estrées s pavilion and not in another street				1654.955734645365
ay said porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan i have none said athos but d artagnan will discover one d artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded				12584.255641526355
there disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneys general and bailiffs				56064.30678333924
caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen andrea go down the three stories but also cross the court				908.084531840138
he seems besotted said danglars pushing caderousse with his knee				2032.0895112720555
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said porthos				145.04224314751454
i have a father who is seventy if he yet lives i only love him and a young girl called mercédès				1363.1742391303367
noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his child but wished her good night for grief and fatigue had made her appear quite ill				19855.161024200366
the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door				212.24522111321215
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way				676.9279037773875
two hours after as midnight sounded the sentinel was relieved				18359.852649001627
now i think no more i say only that fortune has turned against me i had thought to gain heaven and now i have lost it				88.82724200292431
nay said caderousse one can t always work one is not a dog so much the better for the dogs said monte cristo				202.14528343696307
didn t you see that monsieur d artagnan mounted with difficulty				3906.7163790301465
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food				5397.241067018886
the island of tiboulen chapter 22				41756.893368416924
he listened all was silent as it had been for the last three days				1678.9779322644326
i therefore may hesitate between you				96.26816842395199
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength				1717.6499869639472
devil s coachman cried friquet you re meddling too				2059.266269775067
are you also the victim of a treachery no said the novice but of my devotion of a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still and who has abandoned you is that it i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me				126.05719410175836
meanwhile the queen every hour had been sending for d artagnan				80.14295285081347
a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room and went to open the door himself				264.2357854385726
my son said the old gascon gentleman in that pure béarn patois of which henry iv				1175.3213009943474
will you permit me to inquire said madame de villefort as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here no i do not replied monte cristo it is a small place i have purchased quite lately				50207.28835858979
inured as men may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a dream and a reality between the project and the execution				3070.2852661546385
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis				151.4832999580098
in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lord s passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personage s past life				469.1684516473894
athos therefore commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner				804.0350849215338
some of your people have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested edmond dantès mate of my vessel i know it monsieur replied villefort and i am now going to examine him oh said morrel carried away by his friendship you do not know him and i do				915.8986898015091
the host opened the door of a large room in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney				15143.809861640764
all my hopes are blighted my heart is broken my life a burden everything around me is sad and mournful earth has become distasteful to me and human voices distract me				126.05743453700447
have you informed him of it i wrote to him from boulogne				2463.7013422266805
0329m but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention and so he was murmured caderousse				528.750855984908
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count				288.85037297759766
you heard a private conversation respecting spanish affairs on the expulsion of don carlos				39157.00250702017
still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason				3545.1036525156646
anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur				35449.80366103651
surely you ought to be able to tell me better than any other person yes but in our situation we must not say all we know particularly as we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues well can i see porthos certainly monsieur				1109.4334803090494
she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves that immense breaking of the ocean with her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans thou leavest thy servants lord to see if they be strong but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on these verses were not excellent very far from it but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry				51235.39235548332
yes you are right a furlough is needful still another obstacle murmured mme				194.57686803608922
then too i confess i should not be sorry to come across mordaunt again				392.0008019181933
the deputy procureur was therefore the first magistrate of marseilles when one morning his door opened and m morrel was announced				1854.510984153705
paris this odious paris waking up one morning without queen or king surrounded besieged famished having for its sole resource its stupid parliament and their coadjutor with crooked limbs charming				6861.9956247698465
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his son s warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother				1345.4130285859803
my ship is ready and had you not come i must have set off without you for general cromwell expects my return impatiently so thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are addressed have you no letter for him asked the young man				179.04246708492744
then casting a glance on the handsome young man who was scarcely twenty five years of age and whom he was leaving in his gore deprived of sense and perhaps dead he gave a sigh for that unaccountable destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that they exist				3791.2094704255055
no light appeared through the chinks of the shutters no noise gave reason to believe that it was inhabited				6729.959326213793
tony carries our muskets then we set sail to night asked aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished				13348.328653370358
they immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road				2062.9282104911313
it is with valets as with wives they must be placed at once upon the footing in which you wish them to remain				11505.168005924594
it was only on the following day at about ten o clock in the morning as he was starting to call on m deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing				5099.270843401409
he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one				372.0571068957612
come fanny we will put her to bed m d avrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered				33847.09128248074
these leaders had corn in abundance and would not let them partake of it they adopted as a maxim for they too had maxims that it was of very little consequence that women children and old men should die so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy				37986.378357033514
do you understand it now athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmen s clothes which the four friends immediately put on they then left the hotel athos carrying a saw porthos a vise aramis an axe and d artagnan a hammer and some nails				6300.663503907064
let us add that in these times of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the mistresses and that the latter almost always left them valuable and durable remembrances as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts				56022.99195351302
night arrived i allowed it to become quite dark				5647.959056984325
a dead horse said d artagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours i seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed porthos leaning over his horse s mane				41416.610602825735
this proof of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the letter will be found either about his person at his father s residence or in his cabin on board the pharaon the abbé shrugged his shoulders				2126.679827223054
porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game and athos was watching them with so much attention that they did not even perceive their young companion go out who as he had told the guardsman of his eminence stopped outside the door				212.2451199068282
if you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of project gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession				2384.9653357187894

he tore the dress of the countess to pieces he tied her hands behind her and hanged her on a tree heavens athos a murder cried d artagnan				80.11410561469643
well be on our side now resumed aramis				151.74761364136447
let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth				2252.3715453529735
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly				4906.315922427952
well said beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend 40178m i am broken hearted said albert				433.8250632100843
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur d arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms				25076.737243735988
i have not that honor monseigneur replied the latter his eyes dazzled by the brilliant style in which d artagnan traveled				36538.94778267727
really i never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion debray smiled				559.2791442767925
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success				9173.88320427042
well well dandré said louis xviii blacas is not yet convinced let us proceed therefore to the usurper s conversion the minister of police bowed				1125.1476773032637
now let us return to the first				1027.0646549590665
the tie is even more direct it seems to me oh madame said villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the marchioness				44402.190493457776
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell				20978.070520491285
those barrels i saw through the door port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum				5067.575179971146
in an instant dantès plan was formed				7175.991147012389
the other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully i only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not fight do not be alarmed said beauchamp he will meet you				95.69693910074358
this was the last blow to the prisoner				687.6076394712195
but in returning thither last night when fortunately you did not accompany him as his carriage was crossing the rue de la ferronnerie his guards insulted the people who began to abuse them				157.70574672015653
i wrote to franz and were he here he would confirm every word i wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being and signor luigi vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said château renaud				889.1560129130775

at length he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend				6660.750887511924
yes i know that said d artagnan and you mentioned it to me but who knows what has become of him				50.33944224620656

here were not as in other tombs ignoble drawers one above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum all that was visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy looking room separated by a wall from the vault itself				1888.6656087901092
oh water is even more scarce than wine your excellency there has been such a drought come thought danglars it is the same old story and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration				2590.778152066306
have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker				10212.240365863549
mute with horror the three friends had remained open mouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was audible				2907.5378241179696
the monk cried the host where is the monk grimaud sprang toward an open window which looked into the courtyard				3624.9049400333515
this screaming mob are they or are they not my subjects				9643.761837398228

at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats				28785.46377631221
the captive who was the source of so much alarm to the cardinal and whose means of escape disturbed the repose of the whole court was wholly unconscious of the terror he caused at the palais royal				1985.107077354837
he wished once again to press the count s hand but his own was immovable				13657.709512340425
i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the sound of my footsteps and the creaking of the floor he opened his eyes fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his lips as though trying to speak then overcome by the effort fell back and expired				36776.14621997048
take care of the executioner d artagnan all right				1369.486777633935

madame said the president may reference be made to the count of monte cristo who is now i believe in paris sir replied haydée the count of monte cristo my foster father has been in normandy the last three days who then has counselled you to take this step one for which the court is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your misfortunes sir replied haydée i have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief				1097.5072983356458
is monsieur d artagnan there yes madame in your oratory				17855.122810534554
poor kitty hoped to speak a few words to d artagnan when he passed through her chamber but milady herself reconducted him through the darkness and only quit him at the staircase				2584.966044760752
still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month				2731.7476231819887
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark				5650.3618637692825
assassin of buckingham assassin of felton assassin of my brother i demand justice upon you and i swear that if it be not granted to me i will execute it myself and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of d artagnan leaving the place free for another accuser				58729.79160817947
then turning to aramis aramis he said break your sword aramis hesitated				4785.084543471041
if i believed that i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles leaving the house to return to it no more fernand s eye darted lightning				2496.1290083331987
tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered				7578.374201469638
in the meantime my dear lucien here are cigars contraband of course try them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves peste i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable				39252.60514689475

dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek				48604.41133477313
the first card struck off was taken according to your orders to the baron danglars rue de la chaussée d antin no				412.6916841094665

you are right your excellency he said this must be one of your friends then going to albert he touched him on the shoulder saying will your excellency please to awaken albert stretched out his arms rubbed his eyelids and opened his eyes				492.3635269086445
we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the count of monte cristo				202.17246735247105
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hôtel				4128.196285087058
she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hours together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere				11914.65876194376
he listened to know whence this sound could proceed				9961.660960039893
conspiracy danglars followed edmond and mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas then turning round he perceived fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking song				14381.871847852126
you told me that your instinct and although you pretend to know nothing about speculations i think on the contrary that your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs well you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern				38727.68794005722
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantès carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value why everything is relative answered the abbé				797.9218422693084
speak monsieur speak at once said mazarin what is the matter the matter is my lord that the duc de beaufort has contrived to escape from the chateau of vincennes mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news				3113.295231144139
ah heavens if it were that				540.5995670690239
and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking glass				1119.872753113851
the whole of the property consisting of an immense workshop two pavilions at the bottom of the garden and the garden itself had been purchased by emmanuel who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation				19147.421973104356
jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was				868.4833620126782
his majesty has so good a heart that he can not understand hatred is so loyal that he does not suspect treason				5230.9210144170565
at pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine o clock galloped into the yard of tréville s hôtel				4128.239591816682
the count of san felice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited				5943.831588252613
loud roars of laughter and sullen murmurs arose together				1576.454529235179
but in fifteen days as you know or as you do not know this fatal campaign is to open				1289.5582741344892
say that i am permitted to walk in those woods				29272.249140803167
i lost madame du vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in affliction on that account				1862.9690861643217
how pale you look it is very evident what is the matter with her said madame de villefort m				666.6307978969611
milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation				4079.4243484666677
doctor do you hear them call for help yes yes let us hasten up it was in valentine s room but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening				55801.066637260905
behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in length				10693.062286516737
aramis who was constantly at work at his poem shut himself up in athos s closet and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of drawing swords				4751.851070952888
i have always found them and more i repeat it with joy with triumph i have always found some proof of human perversity or error				9238.35182136564
oh yes yes be assured i shall save you				95.77897468901449
it is you who with that mandate obtained the pasha s ring which gave you authority over selim the fire keeper				10779.365099014278
ideas do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely ideas and men appeared the same to him said albert				433.8012745126477
rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious by these words entered the apartment where he found mazarin sitting at the table dressed in his ordinary garb and as one of the prelates of the church his costume being similar to that of the abbés in that day excepting that his scarf and stockings were violet				57960.3822663344
now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion m de tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly				2383.1282636145124
be it so replied d artagnan that is exactly what i want d artagnan in two steps was engaged with the foe whom according to custom he attacked impetuously but he met this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him pause				3902.7169880927986
you do not know what he is about in the cellar				3566.821021617821
he found as provident a host and a fresh horse				507.68746294940354
during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath				12153.548142501324
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy				37958.276889051565
i am mad for her kitty breathed a second sigh				1081.6245535064027
well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one and let us drink what asked the host quite cheerful again				391.97164339715795
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of henry iv when shall we two walk together athos then said to aramis				151.46885407360074
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver general				2605.5892874796514
there is still something else said he				209.22206227350136
now it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals factions and government intrigues				8303.4745053236
he departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her whom he awaited you know not the subject of their conversation he gave her a box told her not to open it except in london was this woman english he called her milady it is he it must be he murmured tréville				1861.3006562227151
when he compared the public crimes of this minister startling crimes european crimes if so we may say with the private and unknown crimes with which milady had charged him felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life				469.1684516473894
you will then have our swords with which i can assure you my friend and i can play tolerably well				642.6712976311286
i am determined to tell them all about it be silent you simpleton cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety				4098.55948671382
he will answer you the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor				1564.415459223561
as my grandfather used to say i once reigned in paris				458.3500047575873
come let us speak of your little affairs				3695.5714635920795
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips				448.31320884274106
monsieur said m de tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair i have no objection replied m de la trémouille but i warn you that i am well informed and all the fault is with your musketeers you are too just and reasonable a man monsieur said tréville not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you make it monsieur i listen how is monsieur bernajoux your esquire s relative why monsieur very ill indeed				896.9171969926891
my god i am lost felton remained standing motionless and undecided				41966.96589674404
but since the end of the month m morrel had passed many an anxious hour				1300.2650039756084
d artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume				11670.109964485408
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence and d artagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends				429.70458192216194
ah said he dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness do not talk of such things and suffer love pains				25623.376952009086
morrel suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him				50.362995400563065
he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into prosperity				54418.37177512416
one fact more than the rest brought his friend sinbad the sailor back to his recollection and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors and pastrini s account of vampa s having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers and fishermen reminded franz of the two corsican bandits he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its course and touched at porto vecchio for the sole purpose of landing them				157.705445920603
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings				22721.37004936033
come come said d artagnan more reason why we should start on our journey				1052.1991846392557
this andrea was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort of education if not a complete one he had been presented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune supported by an honorable name				579.4686531842649
the party was to take place at st germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac bicarat and two other guardsmen who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts ah ah				256.50758652577605
but what is the matter albert				435.779974462957
oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairy scene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said haydée quietly and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here on what subject shall i converse with her said albert in a low tone to monte cristo				202.1432592490653
meanwhile valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to me the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus				49817.23726823303
you will find mine on my saddle already loaded mouston breathed a sigh he couldn t understand visits of ceremony made under arms				513.9460807109449
once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess everything				1025.3969676215675
all this negotiation must be carried on openly i will follow your eminence s instructions to the letter				592.0229486310518
he had reported to aramis what had taken place and aramis not less distrustful than he had increased his suspicions				9435.793431033317
look gentlemen all these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the count s forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt ali s blood still lingering there				485.75098936347683
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony				11918.613639186548
it is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me				126.06434724645467
the air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning				871.1016729488224
let those who have ears hear and those who have eyes see i can tell you nothing more at present go ahead my friend said athos i am sure that whatever you do is well done and you aramis are you of that opinion entirely so my dear d artagnan very good said d artagnan here indeed are true believers it is a pleasure to work miracles before them they are not like that unbelieving porthos who must see and touch before he will believe the fact is said porthos with an air of finesse i am rather incredulous d artagnan gave him playful buffet on the shoulder and as they had reached the station where they were to breakfast the conversation ended there				485.7512209876534
the news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the city				1258.4219235347757
yes madame are you ready i am and his eminence the cardinal has got off without any accident				5022.4024091644715
albert is ten minutes after time there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant how imprudent said château renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat				8175.068505519069
you are the directors of all consciences				16470.933383232157
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the new comer had proved to be a customs officer but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit				50685.87918205725
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queen oh my lord				696.2897469337126
d artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder				1457.3488925369577
at this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still				4772.346790193606
listen my dear friend in two words you will know all				335.73137445036906
shall i go and offer her my services thought he				208.82617130151135
you will find him quite enthusiastic upon what subject asked madame danglars				455.1328053655696
in the position in which raoul lay unfortunately he could neither draw his sword from the scabbard nor his pistols from their holsters				5180.896663451501
danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well				642.6884590353494
villefort became pale he understood the old man s meaning				1671.9992432350618
the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m de morcerf and is justified by his son				1000.8315686547131
mousqueton who knew nothing of what was going on in the chateau wondered that the idea had not occurred to him sooner				23971.101108267292
my good friend said albert i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or not he is really out sir replied baptistin				2883.9374015856006
she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days				1678.9907418983519
as soon as the earnest money was paid d artagnan took possession of his lodging and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost new doublet of the elder m d artagnan and which she had given her son secretly				18350.032547690844
franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso				12611.732525459965
athos then went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time continued tréville to a young béarnais a cadet in his majesty s guards the company of monsieur dessessart but scarcely had he arrived at his friend s and taken up a book while waiting his return when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house broke open several doors the cardinal made the king a sign which signified that was on account of the affair about which i spoke to you we all know that interrupted the king for all that was done for our service then said tréville it was also for your majesty s service that one of my musketeers who was innocent has been seized that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor and that this gallant man who has ten times shed his blood in your majesty s service and is ready to shed it again has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace bah said the king who began to be shaken was it so managed monsieur de tréville said the cardinal with the greatest phlegm does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer this gallant man had only an hour before attacked sword in hand four commissaries of inquiry who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance i defy your eminence to prove it cried tréville with his gascon freedom and military frankness for one hour before monsieur athos who i will confide it to your majesty is really a man of the highest quality did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hôtel with the duc de la trémouille and the comte de châlus who happened to be there the king looked at the cardinal				410.1122303483416
i was hipped to death and still further upon my honor i don t like english horses				903.4752036234613
so then said he the letter was true to the end did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all ah true said monte cristo there is a postscript yes yes repeated the major yes there is a postscript in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for 2 000 francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of 48 000 francs which you still owe me the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety				4418.576247857818
then raising him up as tobit raised the fish by the gills you must pull him into the room taking care to squeeze him so tight that he can t cry out oh said porthos				145.0387851121856
i will ask the cardinal it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fête yes madame replied the astonished king but why do you ask that it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs that is to say madame it was he sire it was he well and what does it signify whether it was he or i				668.1338102154782
d artagnan saw that the moment was come				1006.3420290098612
the poor child was constant in her attendance on her mother and sought by her filial attentions to make her forget the absence of her two sons and her other daughter				2546.1024341860434
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat				2113.0095352665603
say the devil my dear friend said d artagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you say oh gentlemen said the host i have been wrong				1961.181086686385
m de villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair				1143.3316665589516
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory				2797.678854992596
two hours after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded				33906.1166080175

speak that your eminence will go at once to the queen what for merely to say these words i am going to send monsieur d artagnan away and i wish him to set out directly i told you said mazarin that you had seen the queen i had the honor of saying to your eminence that there had been some mistake what is the meaning of that may i venture to repeat my prayer to your eminence very well i will go				1838.1269687484266
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time thank you sir it will be well employed i hope cromwell turned as he was going				2129.244967131203
undoubtedly madame said d artagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own				1169.353280608978
my father and m danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m danglars in the commissariat department				32485.584368873984
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coolly such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely				5044.955074082794
let us die then as de winter has died as for me i will fly only on condition that we all fly together impossible said d artagnan we are under mazarin s orders i know it and i have nothing more to say my arguments lead to nothing doubtless they are bad since they have not determined minds so just as yours besides said aramis had they taken effect it would be still better not to compromise two excellent friends like d artagnan and porthos				145.03864679248733
well my dear viscount said monte cristo i have an infallible remedy to propose to you what is that asked the young man				179.0439184505304
that your mother and m de villefort are both coming to this dinner				2472.1990814810297
yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate in four days said morrel it is extraordinary indeed said château renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too				2060.126624227839
we need hardly add that these peasant costumes like those of the young women were brilliant with gold and jewels				12049.116725418386
where on the balcony not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur d artagnan is right the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger				1692.1729465861536
0285m evening came and edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck				3102.488801400569
does this man know your majesty personally inquired aramis				151.61163986397577
i have known persons he continued for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of d artagnan who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward				13260.81824662886
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission				4207.093232264768
monte cristo saw nothing but the shadow which no one else observed				7993.2364009275225

he not only talked much but he talked loudly little caring we must render him that justice whether anybody listened to him or not				591.6447894144054
i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me and as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door keeper				10779.395939069322
she was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback				3326.1713572805916

no no madame said felton only do not sing so loud particularly at night and at these words felton feeling that he could not long maintain his severity toward his prisoner rushed out of the room				219.260538539342
they conducted me to the chatelet where i slept soundly being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free				5893.48320567483
in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal s hat				2243.541169367315
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past				3883.0183570008694
the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate valentine will not die a superhuman joy expanded the old man s eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude				1693.981347908171
now that they are guilty of a conspiracy against england will your honor give me all four of them take them said cromwell				1618.4351304554552
your swords are in the corner do not forget them they are in many circumstances very useful there is porthos s purse too he put it into his pocket				1334.3090876650524
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart				360.6754609213533
besides my friend d artagnan has something to say to me privately have you not d artagnan d artagnan nodded his head and bazin retired after placing on the table the spanish wine				1190.4884785279353
you will be a brave and adventurous captain d artagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp				11260.483410788336
bless me murmured baron danglars this must surely be a prince instead of a count by their styling him excellency and only venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre				11394.413684829882
assunta took care of all and our little fortune increased				17903.530725351167
years rolled on and amongst the descendants some were soldiers others diplomatists some churchmen some bankers some grew rich and some were ruined				6088.517903675046

the jailer came in the evening				755.78617808986
well within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions i promise you will produce ten or twelve but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie i saw you arranging a deposit is not that the term of five millions and a half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken				39488.88688616737
you are right a mute from the east				15383.214384786712
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services				8343.465465558702
soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god				569.4479795790526
she loves him devilishly he murmured				4675.718370425226
m de monte cristo saved your life you yourself presented him to us				454.0654315981681
but this is indeed civil war which you propose to me dear aramis war for the king yet the king will be at the head of the army on mazarin s side but his heart will be in the army commanded by the duc de beaufort monsieur de beaufort				2696.390134969963
do you permit me to return yes to morrow the cardinal took the queen s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips				448.31406393314245
do you know what he has done this child				828.3787695602059
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it				88.82652195163874
d artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul				841.5133143195609
soon strange fact aramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which porthos unfastened his entirely				35430.031750063914
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which porthos went to the gaming table				750.2068213828794
well madame it proved to be as we had supposed there was a mistake				3995.408233644515
once outside he and planchet set off as fast as they could and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate				1067.782215666237
monsieur porthos what do you say to that i say it is easy enough answered porthos				145.04867531252032
it was all up with him continued aramis ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly athos took lord de winter s hand and tried to turn the conversation				1078.2562309532184
the bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor ship owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources				13837.666013121128
let me meditate and consider meditate and consider as much as you like replied porthos who was now quite out of humor at seeing things take this turn				1019.473918905311
his mother the councillor s old servant opened it				88.92378168916471
we will not go till evening this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it				88.83194365774087
the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz d épinay s possession signed by me and with a postscript of m luigi vampa				1874.6319421442215
of course you sent for a doctor immediately but as i have told you it was too late yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke and what did you do then m				666.6330230210214
we are compelled to admit to our readers that d artagnan thought nothing about him in any way or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be				833.5563714290229
debray inquired danglars with an air of indulgence and good nature that made monte cristo smile acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker s domestic life				469.16934651604765
these four frenchmen have escaped from newcastle and no doubt want to carry off the king				425.0239333525744

whilst we thought you indifferent to our sorrows which you couldn t share without crime you alone among us have discovered what we were searching for in vain				1188.5474987353753
this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint				4897.307716329832
i will continue then resumed aramis				152.35286959847727
never mind in the meantime he marries mercédès the lovely mercédès at least he returns to do that during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man on whose heart caderousse s words fell like molten lead				27200.559260223756
i can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the learned world and the gentleman who was only a knight of the legion of honor was made an officer come said monte cristo this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded				44310.987974330346
28 gaspard puget the sculptor architect was born at marseilles in 1615				47854.24682775942

will you let me be killed				4843.327601976673
the coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the affirmative				5268.630384604122
aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishop s place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at whitehall				37809.78677342439
you have forgotten it porthos said he				209.20560172020734
he was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours paris would be under arms				513.9438750983803
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts				14521.609029219442
i had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty feet square and a depth of two feet				905.3615354269036
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them dantès sighed heavily				20713.233218457455
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond raised his head and listened				6071.557665230163
yes yes murmured he i have often felt regret for the victim but never the very slightest remorse for the assassin athos shook his dead doubtfully				53313.633873102845

then they looked at one another				583.1194131411337
everything goes as if in flowery paths everything goes too well porthos				145.07364588158075
she held in her hand a fresh billet from milady				406.6766889247115
at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner				687.2988488136543
the conditions required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him				50.338602123136596

but what are you going to fight about athos asked aramis				151.52628461091265
the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking houses churches museums or theatres				16466.127465230933
at the same time mercédès reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which she sometimes wore				47973.23421274013

i saw the soldier s shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me well inquired dantès				540.5959581896118
from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anything d artagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart				360.67580488844095
nevertheless bonacieux manifested real joy and advanced toward his wife with open arms				513.9953418579142
one ball struck the head of the already wounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of d artagnan				80.11418201749777

my love my blood my life				470.65045130021986
the event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas				4791.322226670926
humph murmured athos it is certainly she and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady				406.6010677193394

as i had nothing more to do at versailles i went to auteuil and gained all the information i could				7819.4372381286275
then cried planchet joyously i see well that it is the same comte de la fere whom we seek				30678.80911366638
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh				6903.39369639557
it is some time since we heard from his mistress said athos in a low voice				412.83752884090035

one fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishing boat boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the never to be forgotten night of his departure for the château d if he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither				22133.836618805704
dantès remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abbé was mad such a conviction would be so terrible				6466.986803883275

pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy then i have full occupation for i am so not yet wait a little				1276.7144869409249
villefort rose and ran towards his mother in law for it was she				716.1702125643093
my dear athos you view things on the dark side methinks my dear fellow i mistrust women				2058.6516704013907

the brand of england it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on me and i could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the kingdom but the brand of france oh by that by that i was branded indeed this was too much for felton				681.1215436599513
stop said the englishman i have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper				2624.1062772514674
the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder				1457.32387569992

but is it the custom for the officers in the english navy to place themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in a port of great britain and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct them ashore yes madame it is the custom not from gallantry but prudence that in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular hôtels in order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full information can be obtained about them these words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most perfect calmness				8293.131067806606
these considerations naturally gave villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its contemplation				14828.796046211566

news from your father do you hear henrietta				20996.46432077374
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money 50141m mercédès had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference				5649.585957929474
and why not asked the young man				179.46779300724137
both were men of courage and honor and as m de la trémouille a protestant and seeing the king seldom was of no party he did not in general carry any bias into his social relations				45314.101664204354
on the day after the morrow by eleven o clock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was				868.4833620126782

there was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of milady which however immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose				2220.23648877166
dead on the scaffold condemned by parliament impossible and executed in our presence what then has monsieur de flamarens been telling me monsieur de flamarens yes he has just gone out athos smiled				559.2727438715489

valentine was sitting at a little distance from them timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged to speak				976.0259087659315
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires to this athos replied quietly we also have money left for i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs				20075.78171623225
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass				1119.8834331036
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude				21548.257459911612
take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave i thank your majesty said aramis but under these robes i have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger go then sir and god keep you the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the ante rooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop s palace				957.6294858060251
you met a monk did you not yes the young men looked at each other with an expression of fear				1176.5638854823333
when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landing place passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return				1260.4788161958718
he had not so noble an air as athos and the commencement of their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman whom he endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress				37099.98489418668
morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome with whom your father does business the young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase				2584.9685099776534
the dim light the profound silence and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of fear the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work				1090.6620918575277
if he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride				3795.0294451425334
then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his 48 000 francs and the other 50 000 livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon				2794.4150371354467
on going home the two friends found a letter from athos who desired them to meet him at the grand charlemagne on the following day				483.1151041923443
then i confess curiosity mingled with hatred i wished to see what villefort was going to do there and i remained motionless holding my breath				6184.887654557714
dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices				47072.45470264795
it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan that is true said the king but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him				50.3382780794138
some ham my boy or we can t drink and her brother added d artagnan timidly				4152.158942820514
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six o clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening				752.9778677473265
wait said valentine and turning to her grandfather she repeated wa we wi the old man stopped her at the last syllable				14402.775917199164
you accuse me of fear i have not so much as you have since i do not fly as you do				915.9034938939213
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions				1083.6316836139601

after a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming vigorously				41924.16332426603
eight or ten days afterward aramis received the following letter my dear cousin here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of béthune the air of which you think is bad for her				164.27424020469604
but what can be the matter				896.8051509286594
you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw				6838.490270896182
no replied the servants it is even probable that we have not been seen the shots were fired about a hundred paces in advance of us in the thickest part of the wood and we returned to ask your advice my advice is this said monsieur d arminges and if needs be my will that we beat a retreat				3524.3217149902584
he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as d artagnan had so often done formerly				7918.992839541647
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris				458.21692206865623
well what is it what is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out				528.1158748673537

but said d artagnan in the ear of athos you are going to get us all killed without mercy we are much more likely to be killed said athos if we do not go my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that s a fair bet i hope i take it said m de busigny so let us fix the stake you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for eight				2987.794371288257
instead of aiding the movements of my horse i paralyzed them and i was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death sir replied raoul bowing i am entirely at your service i assure you i am called the count de guiche continued the young man my father is the marechal de grammont and now that you know who i am do me the honor to inform me who you are i am the viscount de bragelonne answered raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the count de guiche had done				879.362502556651
bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen and what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked d artagnan				80.11452583100548
morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you				95.69826243373146
for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases madame said d artagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him what				670.0167828344155
now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression				6307.090166116544
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queen s army				1530.4203718503356
if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view				4831.227218189176
my mass lord de winter the corrupted catholic knows very well that i am not of his religion and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me and of what religion are you then madame asked felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal				1941.0898400697843
he would at once approach valentine s father and acknowledge all begging villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two fond and loving hearts				4105.957490005028

these are doubtless your family arms				516.1453621303247
like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you edmond and the rest of mankind and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures				37965.155480641864
i can not explain myself but watch over him emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them				157.70582192013455
how came it known i suppose you read it in the paper in the account from yanina who wrote to yanina to yanina yes				867.2269877247206
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened				6070.405507130013

the door had been opened and shut again the mercer s pretty wife had disappeared				585.3436194897521

suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion				1726.3883562856358
now if you please remove your bandage the general tore the handkerchief from his eyes				492.3853616747042
he was not ignorant that such a beast was worth at least twenty livres and the words which had accompanied the present were above all price				5703.66250616032
after his wife the banker descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage				673.3782228158312
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance				4247.4516832774425
d artagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind				1821.0573711556067
perhaps some accident has happened to him i will hasten replied franz				603.9866260322069
i ask your pardon my dear count said albert for following you here and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your servants that i did so i alone am to blame for the indiscretion				34949.466321812186

have you seen him since i left him				50.44586704730605
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible monsieur de comminges said athos i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me i will do it with all my heart said comminges for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty i know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested				8040.953057133924
i shall complain to m de villefort of the impertinence of his servants madame this is precaution not impertinence no one enters here without an order from m d avrigny or without speaking to the procureur well i have business with the procureur is it pressing business you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet				3320.11502480649
it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which i did not dare to question you since you told me nothing				712.4830365550728
i won t have him killed i won t				32629.7465409282
yes my captain as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking				41308.33050026509
we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pont neuf lucien half smiled				559.2956789960303
i am a priest resumed aramis				152.35250636136337
he was lost in these reflections when the goldsmith entered				727.0917529139524
do these belong to the cardinal				411.2633253466136
these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo				45991.05683733635
you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the count in a perfectly calm tone and this costume a ball costume doubtless becomes her admirably ah monsieur returned albert i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this				1451.2173616030311
but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moment s repose who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england				1053.2724253753424
there is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfather s room she rose				5499.578642396685
see this gentleman out said the count to bertuccio				2151.97419529483
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dantès				540.7800417602128
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind				474.15501750909743
everyone from the highest to the lowest degree has his place on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests as in descartes theory of pressure and impulsion				41548.9818552713
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him				50.342838886692064
oh those villeforts are an accursed race truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone				778.5539417391883
olivain he exclaimed what do i see below there a second scream more piercing than the first now sounded				11171.244804712162
when the wretched man again opened his eyes the count looked at him with a mournful expression of pity and his lips moved as if in prayer				5953.50420762529
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy				4129.290903610184
one of my friends one of my friends please to observe not myself said athos interrupting himself with a melancholy smile one of the counts of my province that is to say of berry noble as a dandolo or a montmorency at twenty five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen beautiful as fancy can paint				43795.041690164486
we fear so and our only regret is to die so far from both of you what will you do in a foreign land an enemy s country i traveled in england when i was young i speak english like an englishman and aramis too knows something of the language				1537.502255786657
my vocation commands me it carries me away d artagnan smiled but made no answer				803.3858780535473
certainly his panegyric has been uttered they parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest he looking after her with eyes of love				978.2498186256894
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having caused the assassination of the duke of buckingham the duke of buckingham assassinated cried all present with one voice				412.8276861445323
the servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere she would receive him				50.33868613481265
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d épinay villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered				7578.374201469638
all we can now do is to wait				3411.680194406481

here he said i am very straightforward in my dealings take your choice the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs				741.7265584737265
hardly had d artagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication				8257.617069626538
in vain were i an ambitious man should i struggle against such remembrances as he has left but that i am not ambitious i am going to prove to you				95.697167260298

it is m franz de quesnel baron d épinay while his wife was speaking villefort had narrowly watched the old man s countenance				1217.6147084747809
now should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices with the rapid instinct of selfishness caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed doubtfully wistfully on danglars and then caution supplanted generosity				13069.47938686725
is supper ready signor pastrini yes your excellency well then let us sup but the carriage and horses said franz				603.9129016958893
tréville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships				13423.531888820487
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de château renaud but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint méran despised all who were not noble				32811.45159495386
as to athos he went out without any mystery took his horse which was tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters in four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for their return carefully examined the priming of his pistols drew his sword and took like a forlorn hope the road to the camp				2462.4716500022414
providence is now opposed to them when i most thought it would be propitious				39314.72014771404
well while i was watching not the king as monsieur le comte thinks for i know what it is to see a man led to death and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill while i was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as i said to find out who he was				868.4833620126782
the party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor				1564.4139672814288
morrel i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you with such a fortune you can attain every wish				2144.092507132667

stop a moment cried d artagnan pray how many men have you on board captain i don t understand was the reply				1028.4854004896295
he dismounted twenty men to make a breach in the barricade whilst he and others remaining on their horses were to protect the assailants				37030.278532229604
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villefort s face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also				1205.046660039679
the guests in the house in the rue du helder where albert had invited the count of monte cristo everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of may to do honor to the occasion				18716.684061806878

lean a little to the left				1350.0040264774366
tréville was one of these latter				3738.4205754326576
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so				430.4826727696996
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced				16100.574311575883
we shall see returned the other smiling				828.6094827209779
leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of montlhéry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name				579.4686531842649
felton was a puritan he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet				905.3658525374134

on his side buckingham in pretending to maintain the honor of england was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal				410.11418592050865
sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other men i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings				22721.37004936033
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth				2400.4042252752906
your fellow countryman bonaparte became emperor we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican				29585.626918759703
we need not say she stopped at the first floor				1564.4646941121391
i ate some bread and some fruit then remembering the narcotic mixed with the water i had drunk i would not touch that which was placed on the table but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed in the wall over my dressing table				750.2071791094535
so my dear mother i am going at once to ask franz to lend me the small sum i shall require to supply my present wants you my poor child suffer poverty and hunger				3968.1398167393872
the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles with directions from dantès to join him at the island of monte cristo				202.1466329068224
it seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought				1955.9110496103185
what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor				2461.742581004117

the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal				53854.336057763176
why should not the king of france have the same chance as the emperor your eminence means i presume the knife stab in the rue de la feronnerie precisely said the cardinal				410.112621462029

an hour before daybreak cucumetto aroused his men and gave the word to march				4856.259439678312
i wish to see everything if your majesty wishes to look out well then look replied d artagnan				80.11662694561286

he had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him				50.33829008099596
monsieur d artagnan repeated louis very well madame at this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult were approaching				2042.555145225989
now really let me ask sir have you do you believe you have anything to do				915.9157226064947
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture				3262.624489346713
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared				585.3391536893783
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law				2552.1179927109974
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go on i listen sire said blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire mala ducis avi domum continued louis xviii still annotating				27669.856020712734

toward six o clock m de tréville announced that it was time to go to the louvre but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past instead of claiming the entrée by the back stairs he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber				3180.169054744337
oh said caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair i should say you were the englishman lord wilmore i am neither the abbé busoni nor lord wilmore said monte cristo think again do you not recollect me there was a magic effect in the count s words which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man				179.04246708492744
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner s feverish imagination				2131.929088350268
what then would be the use of all i have suffered				34657.848788829855
it appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush				24044.55028578398
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately				1383.816705154005

he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing room before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a bow window and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father s departure				2319.559632832477
he found athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find him				50.33904618644095
while monsieur d arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry				33614.291709184545
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth d artagnan s confidence stopped there				485.7516842363379
the englishman calculated fast the two harnesses were worth three hundred pistoles				1174.9705198709628

the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him				50.33855411652752
the young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish night				877.9451111686982
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green door				212.24542352612482

aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times				5610.305528118783
he still lives are you quite sure of it i am he there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature				2766.7783753124127

as to d artagnan afraid of some feint he still stood on the defensive				46920.78574893051
to take mazarin athos curled his lip with disdain				11046.50940658777

the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière a street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailor but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès				540.5959581896118
oh no no cried milady no sir do not call him i conjure you				95.70757191396373

in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton ah sir				538.6684010266815
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires				12060.98120594089
nearly ten minutes passed i heard no other noise but the beating of my own heart				360.68904787074655

i told her of the scaffold oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also				1205.0265488216298
when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil what difference does that make said porthos				145.0387851121856
it appears to me you make dull jokes my dear said porthos				145.07433764828036
valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it				88.83096942053709
england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained				23424.477202790884
now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast				3914.070441618234
before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in				1177.649978312815
d artagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed				4864.709624567385

like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse				31811.29196959722
the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable				7946.340940589828
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard				23630.38488765616
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say				954.3519139374954
you have water woods flowers there she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color				9810.42828905669

will they never bring that emetic asked the doctor				1208.528076032924
some few minutes had elapsed and the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had entered it and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his eye caught sight of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four feet of the ground and then leaped lightly on his feet				905.3615354269036
on they all set off swift as the wind				9561.306501399566
the cousin was received with resignation that was all				335.8766067533821
i can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged villefort cast a gloomy look around him				50.33845810344671
there you must rest young people are such braggarts it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds				34294.47312176284
one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king louis xiv then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre dame				4176.6510268603515
this time i too saw them said porthos				145.2788300063542
little flirtations perhaps and that s all				336.37154033548137
gondy edged into a corner saw them vanish from the first until the last but one				372.0794613096439
then if you wish to take my advice said the young man coldly i would recommend you to travel to travel she murmured				4680.67506986318
you are right cried the affrighted mme				195.0840219279383
i fell upon one knee then upon both				5660.080478387826
well asked athos when he had closed the letter				592.1282553512898
oh father father murmured she courage the pharaon has gone down then said morrel in a hoarse voice				412.8333948798432
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold				3415.2610672755727
aramis affected a laugh to divert the attention of certain curious listeners and perceiving that athos had betaken himself to the embrasure of a window and remained there he proceeded to join him throwing out a few words carelessly as he moved through the room				219.26032943629752
there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name				579.4694821214154
then d artagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation but he could not succeed				10936.748748640008
yes my lord and how much will that cost me monsieur d artagnan zounds my lord i don t know yet				3320.0833618732045
tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went out				528.1186449526211
in fact said athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did add to that d artagnan s rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth and here we are at the ninth				35139.899931858985
if your eminence is disguised it will be almost easy ah said mazarin breathing more freely				25265.608492858282

did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night there now				1201.940874358264
everything was in the same state				5593.247671690212
at last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep				3193.480700890529
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning what cried all the guests you have not eaten for four and twenty hours no replied the count i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nîmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop and you ate in your carriage asked morcerf				1583.9858244253564
here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile				397.56662485781277
to this monsieur de beaufort replied that since every opportunity of distinguishing himself in arms was taken from him he wished to make himself celebrated in the arts since he could not be a bayard he would become a raphael or a michael angelo				21775.975154297023
the count of morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues				6294.207374352193
yes monsieur said d artagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me i hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business speak then i am all attention it concerns nothing less said d artagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the queen what did you say asked m de tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon d artagnan				80.11383820546554
mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini				37117.467375543834
with your belt my lord replied la ramee				1392.538991056272
how can you remember what monsieur de richelieu did				3033.832466504843
danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon				25011.057047283397
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself				264.2321315380465
why i have as much money as i want mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it				88.82978340705807

has anyone brought a letter for me asked d artagnan eagerly				1947.2231717382697
a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart				28084.667046324856
aramis smiled as one who hopes				6342.2729018022455
we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some orders i have given have been executed excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you ah				256.50758652577605
believe me the cord is more certain than the knife felton grew pale and made a step forward remembering that at the moment he entered milady had a rope in her hand				231.95352256430365
no louis xviii the brother of louis xvi				6624.11098433128

besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses				7796.688657736924
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest shadow of remorse had never clouded villefort s brow because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent man whose happiness he had destroyed				6377.913436838075
milady uttered a cry of joy this man was the comte de rochefort the demoniacal tool of his eminence				1735.4765164536125
felton walked into the sea up to his middle being unwilling to trust his precious burden to anybody				7401.5224481111045

at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do they opened the door and the four men alighted franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father s death which had hitherto been a mystery				6214.443996455719
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no origin once a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue				24496.279115102167
there came in moreover two drafts which m morrel had fully anticipated and which cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted				3277.797015488146
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani s a well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation				1078.255716800704
pardieu said villefort he is a noble fellow				1191.7243676499959
now said felton we are safe milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted				1876.0135174837856
leaning against the tree he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house				465.29321203681343
curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito and he was recognized				8459.820128079937
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor				1403.32830997359
i am a faithful subject of the king madame and all that his majesty commands i shall do well it is true said anne of austria and the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully				72885.69303285782

but milady felt herself denounced even by his terror				1755.3561263042975
is it to make me a captain				1720.829160035897
at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them				157.71146202068354
thanks my dear friend said madame danglars trying to smile it is over now and i am much better chapter 64				42817.06106046
his eyes dilated and a shudder ran through his body				892.2156358537252
a burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain and two or three heads carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment appeared through the openings of the tapestry				22409.057238669127
and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this 3 000 francs child sighed mercédès				1363.2054400696572
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dantès the features of his conductor an under jailer ill clothed and of sullen appearance				2014.322975158628

no noise from without by which i could measure the time reached me i only supposed it must be seven or eight o clock in the evening for it was in the month of october and it was quite dark				5650.448082106881
they dragged us away by force				3120.217879605723
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us				454.03382146907535
he held a vial of salts in his hand				232.13454140178996
we can only save you by being free ourselves replied d artagnan in a rapid low tone and if we appear inclined to defend you they will arrest us with you it seems nevertheless come gentlemen come said d artagnan aloud i have no motive for defending monsieur				1109.4329512900674
porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women				2058.1766106824953
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all				335.64125633092425
they were perhaps in league with him oh sire exclaimed the duc de blacas m				666.6279370340827
i am at least fearful of it				89.13511037409201
he then gave himself up to his happiness				3667.826552512618
he took them with him without encouraging them or promising them anything and without concealing from them that their luck and even his own depended upon the cast of the dice				4648.0780883767775

well don t you intend to bring me another plate said dantès				540.643648897577
their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future				1442.267140493405
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of impudence your majesty on your side said d artagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been you are in error sir answered the queen				376.1481715512764
another flash illuminated all around them				158.9025604945045
porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large mustache				13515.492665941
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate				9228.049426871186
all england is with cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners i bend sir to your wishes				2645.6485194051693

your very devoted husband baron danglars the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his self control change color once or twice				2208.0674845416897
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone				858.3570383998242
i warn you however his services will cost you something				3241.510143304655

now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery				24060.515330015085

30043m a quarter of an hour was the reply				1029.0230413475472
but there are some with which on the contrary i am not acquainted				9718.629490669011
at this moment a strange noise like the unloading of a cart and followed by a cry of pain was heard beneath the window				533.2741092498728
i see spots of blood on the ground and he set off to follow the two friends				429.7099093320903

unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night				877.9467857177026
the night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take				11556.753820810092
well done guitant cried the cardinal to the equestrian i see plainly that notwithstanding the sixty four years that have passed over your head you are still the same man active and zealous				50526.856045845234

if he comes out we shall catch him				50.43778539486787
you can suppose porthos that what i have to say relates to most important matters devil take them let us walk in the park answered porthos for the sake of digestion egad said d artagnan the park is like everything else and there are as many fish in your pond as rabbits in your warren you are a happy man my friend since you have not only retained your love of the chase but acquired that of fishing my friend replied porthos i leave fishing to mousqueton it is a vulgar pleasure but i shoot sometimes that is to say when i am dull and i sit on one of those marble seats have my gun brought to me my favorite dog and i shoot rabbits really how very amusing yes replied porthos with a sigh it is amusing d artagnan now no longer counted the sighs				4735.37518209134
as he came near the hotel franz saw a man in the middle of the street				1654.9565237899426
although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me bah said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is in his hands then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes				39958.63720387601
then you were about to tell me all the isolation of your life the griefs of your heart				360.68302827305774
that s too many gentlemen too many				36465.078796770424

monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling ali a horse for m de morcerf quick				14293.773036370489
then turning to ali she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert to approach nearer to her				164.27431853677658
dandré is not a man to be accused of treason				5228.7215065684295
four hundred and seventy five livres said d artagnan who reckoned like archimedes				45250.40450511771
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word i will keep it returned morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons				56739.45858711766
are you not aware that this italian directs everything both indoors and out				528.1760645372594
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman s hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years				880.6914691430138
have you any money the four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful				18260.581514499365
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river				6213.88099917475
we can not say how long the night seemed to milady but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness				26925.66575421146
i said my good fellow that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included				9545.453690013312
he embraced his weeping wife and daughter pressed emmanuel s hand with friendly warmth and then going to his private room on the second floor had sent for cocles				54643.031024279655
my shoulder quite burns if you would permit me said d artagnan with timidity				41711.361297367155
wild dreams had disturbed his repose				4222.3229452965315
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts				11815.310734294924
i am hardly nineteen i know nothing i have no part to play				5690.541382737548
then came a skirmish the more terrible because it had no definite object the more melancholy because those engaged in it knew not for whom they were fighting				9676.429633373651
nevertheless the calm religious dignity of his countenance abashed mordaunt				1926.3423609148174

if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris the four horses will follow you thither				22133.625535097162
very well sir said comminges you shall hear of this anon and you of me sir said louvieres and we shall see then who can speak the loudest friquet and nanette continued to shout the cries the noise of the shot and the intoxicating smell of powder produced their usual maddening effects				30433.911008659736
the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor				15348.98206342345
from their dress covered with dust and from a certain easy manner by means of which a man accustomed to travel is always recognizable the two friends excited the attention of a few promenaders				40466.68838020175
friend d artagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future				1442.267140493405

he wished to subdue this woman in his own name and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce it				88.82664901908853
dantès repeated he edmond dantès yes monsieur villefort opened a large register then went to a table from the table turned to his registers and then turning to morrel are you quite sure you are not mistaken monsieur said he in the most natural tone in the world				822.1780503324067
but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow				32533.267596601443
leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you will confide it to safe hands oh replied the wretched woman mournfully shaking her head the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my heart i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy				22014.97846843949
only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us				454.03468747068985
it was one of those events which decide the life of a man it was a choice between the king and the cardinal the choice made it must be persisted in				1177.64941676568
at the end of three months he had learned to write				2308.2810764682563
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue				24496.16230801946
mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch				26985.614223893455
in the meantime please to sit down monsieur and i will fetch you some refreshment the jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince				1270.8047299191428
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop				20535.545021493053
terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from paris till she reached burgundy her native place				1078.9371839758176
had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale				675.8828898490883
her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess				1964.0775561112184
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace				52315.971800015
grimaud tendered twenty guineas to the captain and at nine o clock in the morning having a fair wind our frenchmen set foot on their native land				3377.655326895761
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat				1631.3581365591697
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity				1957.9611576742507
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man				179.07192357270185
faithful friend noble heart said the king i should not have been rescued				54970.69750594041
it does not appear to be very clean in the crossroads d artagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap				59201.76228431239
idiot that i am though i have been trying to find it out for five years i never found it out but i do not say it was the cause of your imprisonment				23434.666149053093

excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words				832.9897709376306
answer in your turn or you may repent of your disobedience king s musketeers said athos more and more convinced that he who interrogated them had the right to do so				430.46378833156433
these two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet de chambre who opened the door of the vestibule then another which seemed to be that of a waiting room and showing them two stools your orders are very simple he said don t allow anybody except one person to enter here				688.995958306576
this garden has never been a cemetery what is done to infanticides in this country asked major cavalcanti innocently				37502.384826054324
to what do you allude monsieur said danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general s words				832.9897709376306
she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter				2363.0012296097684
by the light of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken dantès saw the old man pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead				53089.579586072075
well cried the three musketeers all together on seeing d artagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger				1783.60015589187
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him				50.33836209054904
i ll manage it somehow you will see but said d artagnan now i think of it what is to prevent our beginning to night nothing at all said groslow				1420.636924018989

but he stopped doubtless to reflect for instead of allowing his first impulse which had been to go straight to lord de winter to carry him away he leisurely descended the staircase left the palace with his head down mounted his horse which he reined in at the corner of the rue richelieu and with his eyes fixed on the gate waited until the queen s carriage had left the court				908.0784697421064
give me a light shall i accompany you monsieur no it is unnecessary bertuccio will show me a light and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge				7496.1361178364805
let us see said d artagnan				80.63533266426805
on whom does my bleeding heart repose				4233.031472540513
now monsieur he said to raoul will you give me the letter you have brought raoul handed the letter to the prince				1270.8035179858884
haydée s nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers nay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence				1698.041935975418
like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his position				2935.0056150229766
she appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal				410.112621462029
besides even you didn t recognize me they will be much less likely to that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you				95.69730415629178
alas alas sir have pity on me the old man s eyes remained fixed on the door				212.25372262175063
ah cried he on perceiving d artagnan ah				256.8052227038266
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth				2400.531279451836

at your age we have faith in life it is the privilege of youth to believe and hope but old men see death more clearly				13465.664183467434
monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m de boville who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left				1348.223351472025
if i am not mistaken we have to do with a gentleman a gentleman exclaimed athos				152.85131864526093
so you are here cried the officer in the tone of ill humor habitual to him what the devil are you doing here i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town what do you mean				15615.632797690954
i love you as my life for you are the best the noblest of created beings 50277m let it be then as you wish sweet angel god has sustained me in my struggle with my enemies and has given me this reward he will not let me end my triumph in suffering i wished to punish myself but he has pardoned me				126.05719410175836
he returned blow for blow and cries of pain began to be heard in the crowd				2126.388806186934
yes and i would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence unless from deepest hell bravo said d artagnan in a whisper to porthos well answered well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people that broussel shall be given up to them madame never said the queen never your majesty is mistress said la meilleraie retreating a few steps				1524.0787856308766
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day				483.1141827242896
in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon				43435.66428901861
four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton				681.2108651330446
the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment				894.0392377460641
leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me monsieur said athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance d artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athos s last remark he stopped short				5566.9908646778595
thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard cavalcanti pronounce these words tomorrow sir i shall have the honor of waiting upon you on business and i sir said danglars shall be most happy to receive you upon which he offered to take cavalcanti in his carriage to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son				1000.8210695688003
bonacieux you will ruin us all but i have sworn to kill that man said d artagnan				80.11762021897269
out of the twenty musketeers sixteen when this took place rejoiced greatly at this relaxation but the other four cursed it heartily				70830.63977814221
they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman				47371.34644512632
but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world				822.1819707922043
i may be besieged in my turn and i shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same advantages with which you gratify your master lord monsieur				1109.4329512900674
d artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris				458.2787602848924
and you my friend there is a demipistole for your trouble you will tell monsieur de tréville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him				50.33878214832839
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with				2069.3024530799958
well i follow its course i track its passage i adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my way for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes well oh speak speak doctor i shall have courage well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one				372.0571068957612
to be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power				3632.615277176514
i heard it from m debray who was present at the explanation valentine also knew the truth but she did not answer				803.3536996219156
it was useless to search at night and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning				871.1045805691987
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart				360.67580488844095
madame more hopeless than he thinks				15822.790545115484
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the blood was pouring in floods				41015.841056832665
one of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal barge near and by its light they examined the weapons				21186.544359793992
and were it not for the windows at the palazzo rospoli by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme i don t know but what i should have held on by my original plan				1525.3212860395456

the victory was complete twice he had overcome his doubts				58630.850965387355
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone				1996.9469557960817
and by whom were they recommended to you oh by the house of fenzi one of the best in florence i do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the agreement would you not trust the cavalcanti i				668.1338102154782
well sir exclaimed mazarin what s the matter				895.2763952121667
but i forgot added the gascon smiling pardon i forgot you are no longer athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner porthos my plan yes have you a plan no				412.6891258899073
my dear aramis said d artagnan if these are the prunes that are sent to you from tours i beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them you are mistaken friend d artagnan said aramis always on his guard this is from my publisher who has just sent me the price of that poem in one syllable verse which i began yonder ah indeed said d artagnan				80.11383820546554
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer s eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarin s purpose				1160.9627869368232
as captain of the musketeers m de tréville had the right of entry at all times				5613.91821368668
tis raoul who is come home athos as the name of raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at d artagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face				673.0090685184233
go to bed or at least lie down in your clothes				2682.4490306449825
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen				376.25078027915566
but as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown				48359.45366650725
help reverend sir help this mournful appeal pierced the darkness				1135.6427521089252
you do not understand asked felton				682.4739862927587
she continued then as if she had not heard his exclamation or as if she thought the moment was not yet come to reply to it				88.82724200292431
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time				473.8390424041263
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune				1182.1785572059587
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world				822.1796185140824
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme				194.8804072108829
i could recite you the whole of thucydides xenophon plutarch titus livius tacitus strada jornandes dante montaigne shakespeare spinoza machiavelli and bossuet				18331.70175700362
d artagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him				50.338878162027264
did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem				38391.72825316284
will you sell him to me for that sum no but i will play for him what at dice no sooner said than done and i lost the horse				507.5388449787902
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp château renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else ah true a diplomatist observed debray				658.7769801109199
i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at a short distance				4772.032763270926
well resumed athos swear on this cross which in spite of its magnificent material is still a cross swear to be united in spite of everything and forever and may this oath bind us to each other and even also our descendants				51689.31483937388
you have understood me then dear monsieur d artagnan said milady				406.64333630070996
you are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal				410.112621462029
buckingham in paris cried he and why does he come to conspire no doubt with your enemies the huguenots and the spaniards no pardieu no				412.6903066046564
do you know in what crime you are to day engaged				15597.519469689316
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor				2460.538505120816
you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the time named he would not only lose his bet but people would say he was afraid and a brave captain of spahis can not risk this even to gratify a pretty woman which is in my opinion one of the most sacred obligations in the world you see my position madame said morrel bestowing a grateful smile on monte cristo				202.1432592490653
well marquis said monte cristo you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom your good fortune has restored to you ah your excellency i am overwhelmed with delight and what are your feelings said monte cristo turning to the young man				179.04246708492744
the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrate s study				2366.3704083969474
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him 1 000 francs for a mouthful of bread				15519.384326887162
madame de villefort acknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles				5644.055329403305
the approach was not such as to prepossess people an ill smelling dark passage a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet				42143.43628447213
what consoles me said the cardinal after reading the letter is that at least in this chase d artagnan has done me one good turn he has destroyed broussel				3832.7798736043255
god s death don t fire screamed d artagnan throwing open the window				533.3310721119825
help help screamed she turning towards the wall as if she would tear an opening with her hands				484.0875401857833
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterday s riot which to day is already a rebellion to morrow may become a revolution yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely				5523.373210233772
calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame				4175.989873836336
besides we are sent here by cardinal mazarin and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal and are therefore as ambassadors able to act with impunity a thing that general oliver cromwell who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general is quite the man to understand				1352.442107598152
alas said d artagnan with the most sentimental air he could assume can you be cruel enough to put such a question to me to me who from the moment i saw you have only breathed and sighed through you and for you milady smiled with a strange smile				397.4944035188306
the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword				947.8123068905444
thank god you have come eh				2037.4569615172554
my lord you are right and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last				2114.1665324714795
she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes				492.36798769612614
dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph				44421.29229920287
it is for you replied a gendarme				9919.569337386387
let us hasten to say that in private the genial side descended to the level of the other so that generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and domineering father				446.58499209538354
i have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write they then separated				7613.754671399075
gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through				2989.387600888837
allow me then if you please to answer in different order or i will not do so at all the astonished president looked at the jury who in turn looked at villefort				302.9855260951583
when one is eating ideas flow easily				27549.15730456945
a priest can understand a father s grief and m de villefort giving the key to d avrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work				1090.6620918575277
general oliver cromwell the four friends looked at one another				581.2289432706684

d artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing				712.5166714492212

so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide marks were				2612.1028405723046
grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the lys				7634.476790211913
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them				157.71807999584544

in the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal				49184.2863222981

they had not shown sufficient pertinacity in their inquiries				21917.630018016866
the baron finding himself disarmed took two or three steps back but in this movement his foot slipped and he fell backward				23232.768056376484
i rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies very well replied m danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker				10212.571502377956

i am a great captain that i am				1744.0144883190123
the duke glanced at the clock				885.8969102822651
he is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in france				587.9661668608442
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès				540.5959581896118
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped				2091.60822307669

after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down				837.4770719649161
thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame				3060.191330874747
one may soon see that you re a soldier				1780.6259345619287
have you a name then i bear that of your brother ay but you are mistaken				2021.4480794929352
this however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his majesty s health				9861.983602277573
there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently				4405.561912444597
it sounds like the cry of one who is being murdered murmured the host				788.2235045647685

dantès is a good fellow i like dantès				540.9133738918513
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily				51617.197649148664
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity				19189.942817534156
do not open the pie till you are alone				858.6444126596273
well said the count you do not get out m bertuccio you are going to stay in the carriage then				889.0228923345012

you have insulted a defenseless man				179.81574329128873
porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a dancer				16659.97075231971
the notary after having according to the customary method arranged the papers on the table taken his place in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards franz are you m franz de quesnel baron d épinay asked he although he knew it perfectly				2150.393492439605
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken				6451.574366104838
i began to fear that he would not come				1006.3914559347832
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve nay be not discouraged				46248.66651706342
20293m it was the end of september the wind blew violently				2729.5705460089466

just ask yourself my good fellow whether there are not many persons of our acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never in their lives were masters of but said franz the corsican bandits that were among the crew of his vessel why really the thing seems to me simple enough				1530.8035444929687
two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man				179.04332082797492
excuse me sir said baptistin who had followed his master with indescribable terror but i think i see a carriage down there under the trees monte cristo sprang lightly from the carriage and offered his hand to assist emmanuel and maximilian				1093.1967245271392
you are right said she i have often thought of it then she added in a low voice and i will think of it again felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones probably lord de winter perceived this emotion				2052.3229583652387
what has happened then sir interposed monsieur de flamarens to athos if we are mistaken the error has originated with the queen				376.15032389453654
at the noise i raised myself up on one hand				232.068800629704
really my lord you are his nightmare the duke smiled with bitterness				42470.852478539644
but alas i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security i trust we shall never find it so in our experience oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness until that time continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in a word and i repeat it because it expresses all i wish to convey we will wait and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name morrel looked obedience to her commands				15126.445782382065

m noirtier had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab horse				507.53787692619136
i always knew you were a good son and inquired dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is well i believe my dear edmond though i have not seen him lately yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence dantès smiled				559.2722105077514
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them				157.74064336198342
in a moment he had passed through them and could see the house distinctly				11432.28123032044

monsieur d artagnan is not with me he serves under monsieur dessessart well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same company that same evening m de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and d artagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning				871.0929501459249
that makes no difference said aramis coloring and who affirmed as i said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it came it is only to poets that such things happen said athos gravely				5523.373210233772

i was for twenty years cardinal spada s secretary i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the year 1811 since then i have demanded my liberty from the italian and french government why from the french government because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department ah said the inspector you have not the latest news from italy my information dates from the day on which i was arrested returned the abbé faria and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant son i presume that he has realized the dream of machiavelli and cæsar borgia which was to make italy a united kingdom monsieur returned the inspector providence has changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly it is the only means of rendering italy strong happy and independent very possibly only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of the food is the same as in other prisons that is very bad the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon but it is not that which i wish to speak of but a secret i have to reveal of the greatest importance we are coming to the point whispered the governor				2461.0911802659825
well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy				1840.8531106766334

only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the means of deceiving mercédès as to the cause of his absence partly on plans of emigration and abduction as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the spot from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man who was for him also the messenger of vengeance				1144.674149523277

bazin my friend come here the door opened and bazin entered on perceiving the musketeer he uttered an exclamation that was almost a cry of despair				1469.8832170332769
bonacieux was known to belong to the queen the duke wore the uniform of the musketeers of m de tréville who as we have said were that evening on guard				1393.9274727751465
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur d herblay i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me really monsieur you say strange things said aramis				151.4689985256255
and you i shared the same fate at aquapendente do you know signor pastrini said albert lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for bandits and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own doubtless signor pastrini found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered half the question and then he spoke to franz as the only one likely to listen with attention				886.0756155873412
thank god we can keep a secret the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker				10212.649418412351
don t laugh my friend cried d artagnan for heaven s sake don t laugh for upon my soul it s no laughing matter and he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a real appearance of terror that athos eagerly seized his hand crying are you wounded my friend				526.2227798804357
immediately afterwards the light expired and the room was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that minute struck half past four				4106.8268776902405
it was evening i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which i in my pride pronounced				16100.558956879004
perhaps i shall stand in need of a back door for retreat you think of everything and you forget one thing what to ask me if i want money that s true				1082.4139523594943
bonacieux would have fled in terror but she was absorbed by jealousy				39827.2303543167
if i were i should do for you at once the most that you deserve				7035.624670344657
oh sir said she clasping her hands				484.7312936410621
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation				40056.38805490161
ah madame he said why did you not make that request of me with you sir replied the baroness one can wish for nothing one is so sure to obtain it				88.82673373082271
well if he does not come it will be because he has been delayed that s all				335.6540602729661
ah i am sure he has not sold the house for what he gave for it the marquis of saint méran returned the count				288.84624096942224
the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck friends taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each other some weeping others noisy in their grief the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar sights daily but which had no power to disturb the current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of maximilian from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay				4781.476245538767
haydée s learned reference is to the behavior of an actor in the dionysian festivals ed				7070.399449168143
your advice then is to sell the diamond replied aramis				151.55171992922715
at nine o clock madame la première présidente arrived				1867.7054694439225
as a reply he wrote the following letter do not depend upon me madame for the next meeting				4206.122392682229
from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate				40357.851080151406
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own				1169.3320923393223
will this promise be fulfilled m noirtier asked morrel while d avrigny looked inquiringly				6122.557286924118
i have told him the truth that is to say that the fault lay with my people and that i was ready to offer you my excuses				59852.847042071815
they are men who do nothing for nothing you know the only reply that i desire said d artagnan the only one worthy of you and of me and he drew nearer to her				164.27431853677658
my friend said aramis take care our safety lies in our obscurity				1957.7118946967528
you at marseilles yes says he				209.62929916279612
do not fear that you put me to inconvenience if i want money i can send for some to any of my chateaux at bracieux alone i have twenty thousand francs in gold				1838.169917124939
i pardon you for the death of poor felton i pardon you for the attempts upon my own person				1123.7798667064715
the chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a woman and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish but on casting her eyes about the apartment she would have found that wish accomplished				26214.212561181885
comminges turned and saw dame nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her hand				231.96270288282778
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude				21538.724360146654
at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniards twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet				905.3615354269036
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice s steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins				39663.71171552033
i never saw a man with a nobler air than his without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can said porthos				145.04085992348945
i was expected at sharp midnight and i am late by five minutes yes but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages when one loves well				642.6670073516758
do as you think best d artagnan at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber but seeing four musketeers standing and their swords by their sides they hesitated about going farther				4015.466395748104
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp				761.3580164931053
are they all full grimaud translated the question and groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered some full others empty d artagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captain s alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them come along he said and he went toward the door of the second compartment				11504.75107051657
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own ears i also said aramis				151.47246541554776
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips				448.34719994232
i respected your father very much said he				208.9636315111378
i demand admittance said a loud voice outside the room in the name of the law as no attempt was made to prevent it the door was opened and a magistrate wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four soldiers and a corporal				16719.371106857612
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis				151.47260987101657
paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries well well				642.6703782831205
at length d artagnan in pursuing his researches found near the wall a woman s torn glove				38381.58773478125
do not call anyone do not be alarmed said the count do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the man standing before you valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of valentine could not reply the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here the count s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl s mind				473.3070170951629
such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament				5085.075960802655
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet				5176.915837805594
ah a thousand thanks count for not having forgotten your promise and the young officer shook the count s hand so warmly that monte cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with pleasure				1281.0869450181128
and athos i don t see athos				153.19608940849932
there are four men come to arrest me				126.2498695415347
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just				36560.419382675194
capital cried the gascon you would make a distinguished general and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard no to be sure replied d artagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him groslow s face brightened				6931.999242536552
in hôtels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host				788.2002019453598
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter				673.7793858701815
dantès sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him				50.37380328650439
but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature				2766.762543724853
milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak therefore she knew him				50.34621174941472
we know the count s vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man				179.04417457509342
what a misfortune he had been informed at seven o clock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle he had hastened to milady s chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution d artagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered felton				681.1215436599513
then he took the glass emptied three parts of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed valentine had taken it and replaced it on the table then he disappeared after throwing a farewell glance on valentine who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the feet of the lord				696.2811145497943
do you think it is to replace him on the throne that cromwell has paid for him two hundred thousand pounds sterling				37634.15969378255
you are not hurt asked d artagnan				80.37011925551043
i can not be mistaken there are your horses				903.739760026563
then having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the door				212.25696138124155
the baroness did not wait for a repetition she ran to her husband who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price				5703.667945599355
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain				1534.6456737477301
for me said d artagnan seizing the letter				592.2654927472915
i dread this marriage maximilian as much as you thank you my adored valentine thank you that is enough				1530.8093840562024
adieu dear sister till your next swoon this was all that milady could endure				2630.0013721760606
only might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made				3640.519075596981
i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances				16919.422456131986
a fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day				483.1141827242896
it is his son d artagnan s arm dropped to his side				823.6141880237831
go and call out your regiment said he i can foresee that we shall have need of it directly winter turned his horse and the two friends rode on				528.3370237472238
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent				1865.5167886804481
at the first announcement of peace madame de chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities				53117.73742435668
albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow				3123.8920199287672
shall i open the secretaire asked valentine				684.4084690669825
they hesitated to break the silence which death seemed to impose at length valentine ventured				65964.77354856647
whether he only held his usual post or whether it was by accident monsieur bernouin was found standing behind the door and must have heard all that had passed				3828.856173083442
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him				50.33854211488241
the son has been educated in a college in the south i believe near marseilles				1472.6038022386265
count he inquired have you any relations no sir i am alone in the world so much the worse why asked monte cristo				202.14528343696307
no you undertook to do so true replied danglars the french have the superiority over the spaniards that the spaniards ruminate while the french invent do you invent then said fernand impatiently				4405.582919850908
i go to the louvre i ask for mme				194.70058506459085
m coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things				2759.504084312522
the executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him				50.34282688402538
captivity the fourth day the next day when felton entered milady s apartment he found her standing mounted upon a chair holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs twisted into a kind of rope one with another and tied at the ends				14298.85852920148
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act				2233.726922020919
julie returned holding the silken purse in her hands while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose				5499.578642396685
he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future				1442.2588877982403
her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts				849.4473749298957
i have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful what a cold wind resumed athos a wintry blast				57670.912057665926
woman was created for our destruction and it is from her we inherit all our miseries at this speech of aramis the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips				448.3129950703955
with three fingers to be sure one for the father one for the son and one for the holy ghost all crossed themselves				1680.9245155437281
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch s blood fell down insensible				3563.716725624046
what is that noise there came a sound like a whirlwind at the same time two troops of horsemen each composed of ten men sallied forth from each of the lanes which encompassed the house and surrounded d artagnan and planchet				662.2885340489573
ah my dear aramis this time i shall find you out and d artagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche				67312.40092039076
the idiot how so if he loved her asked d artagnan				80.14379358825683
the sign of the red dovecot chapter xliv				53927.26451877964
monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him				50.344267224459955
a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to m de villefort s door and the coffin removed into it from the post wagon				15825.959718133496
i have two things to postpone and what are they first a thrust with the coadjutor whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet s and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me oh fie a quarrel between priests a duel between allies what can i do friend				526.2227798804357
nevertheless whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey she resolutely drew near to aramis s shutter and tapped at three equal intervals with her bent finger				1409.9242732631992
i forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle				2426.110155333823
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant stood before her				164.27494519476556
aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them				157.71304128498326
but do you mean to say you have not heard of this				1451.2574978310765
ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi barefooted and out at elbows with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully curved above the head stared at the traveller the post chaise and the horses to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the papal states who earned a pittance by diving into the tiber at high water from the bridge of st angelo				21775.975154297023
you hold the bit too tight and so make his mouth hard so that you will not be able to make him manoeuvre quickly				1625.1367796862532

the magistrate harassed and fatigued had descended to the garden of his house and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose trees which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season				21992.14762504137
oh if that were so i should lose my reason and he folded her in his arms				513.9575990636794
large rooms completely stripped of furniture bare walls upon which here and there shone the old gold moldings which had resisted time and neglect windows with broken panes impossible to close no carpets neither guards nor servants this is what first met the eyes of athos to which he touching his companion s elbow directed his attention by his glances				3502.519048270705
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them				157.7099579741481
did you come from boulogne demanded she of milady				406.7300200243744
when you arrived madame de saint méran had already been panting for breath some minutes she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed				4686.874981730847
yes i have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me				126.06645118978952

the name is wanting in this commission you can write it yourself d artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it it was a lieutenant s commission in the musketeers				844.8206008205789
thither mazarin went in his turn and found the two friends walking up and down				837.500633367382
patience cried athos one of our party is still wanting the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be				833.5571663707046

take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever				1883.6730665802406
what do you want with me said she and why do you place your hand on me i thought that madame was ill and i wished to bring her help responded the maid frightened at the terrible expression which had come over her mistress s face				673.0084266872659
oh sire what a dreadful misfortune				4372.061357631268
well said she you see he refuses yes but why need this annoy you you know albert women are singular creatures				3685.8464432425453
planchet went and presented himself as a lackey out of a place who was in search of a situation				1729.5078296014058
the rue richelieu and the rue villedot were then owing to their vicinity to the ramparts less frequented than any others in that direction for the town was thinly inhabited thereabout				50031.01192733117
if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat				1631.3021292837986
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are mine				1527.8391959748028
it was the way in which he spoke				16900.55431080348
he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on the major s little finger for the major like a prudent man in case of any accident happening to his bank notes had immediately converted them into an available asset				38722.11136779385
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed				43010.762996021454
oh you encourage me and something tells me there placing his hand on his heart that i ought to have no secret from you you are right morrel god is speaking to your heart and your heart speaks to you				95.69698473261094
i have then to inform you sir at the request of m de villefort that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed the feeling of m noirtier towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her				164.27416187265285
i took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count if he were a real count he wouldn t be so rich				3994.5510040199683
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination				2131.8701273511383
now give me the cardinal up here if he makes any noise stifle him mazarin wished to call out but porthos held him tight and passed him to d artagnan who seized him by the neck and made him sit down by him then in a menacing tone he said sir				538.6655756058864

had old æolus appeared at this moment he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli and aquilo the heir presumptive to the throne				4932.245183317856
let us call one of these lackeys with a demi pistole in the left hand exactly so cried aramis				151.4735488349217
this man goes to give his last orders take the least thing drink a finger of wine and let us be gone yes said mme				194.54912835085833
planchet and fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was plain that all assistance was useless all the features of the dying man were distorted with agony				11918.613639186548
you see i am dying d artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in both his own and hastened to her				164.27502352718227
the absence of grimaud whose name had never once been uttered by athos gave d artagnan uneasiness				1665.6356049441727
it was d artagnan who was waiting for him				50.398417892060934
it was for this i had annulled the lease it was for this i had come it was for this i was waiting				2380.623897562907
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you				95.69821680125483
morcerf usually so stiff and formal accosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in order to gain his end but went at once straight to the point				1210.1034745881586
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon you are adorable madame but do not keep raoul with you why not because he is in love he				208.7550860833458
he laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards i am aware of that and i have told him a hundred times that he was wrong				1961.182021850624
as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions				1083.606881536876
d artagnan leaned against the hedge after having cast a glance behind it				88.84477917155284
20301m our expedition made a favorable beginning				41083.723887057065
bernouin shut the door and went away				599.1126467012238
very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see a vessel and good fellows like us on board they come and demand hospitality of us you can t refuse help to a poor hunted devil we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea				1716.5364545645796
it was only poisoned to the abbé adelmonte				30547.198996970794
i broke my word it is true but what signifies that				539.2191271476008
having aroused the enmity of the sultan he was proscribed and put to death by treachery in 1822 at the age of eighty ed				7070.601737812734
i would have given 10 000 i would have given 20 000				5087.365443044067
he told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered that is good proceed and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i have told you of my love and my hopes may i inform you of my intentions yes signified the old man				179.04246708492744
mercédès turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven				741.740352230573
for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions				48084.62939037137
three months since it was m de saint méran madame de saint méran two months since the other day it was barrois today the old noirtier or young valentine you knew it cried morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that monte cristo started he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved you knew it and said nothing and what is it to me replied monte cristo shrugging his shoulders do i know those people				1043.322643113174
but at all events i gave him absolution in articulo mortis				55696.22321590368
danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in such a furious manner put in your head but this was not the time for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a gracious smile excuse me sir but are they not going to give me any dinner does your excellency happen to be hungry happen to be hungry that s pretty good when i haven t eaten for twenty four hours muttered danglars				455.0963467546834
franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfred s shoulders or beneath lara s helmet				34021.328901634544
the young woman hastened to meet him				50.546141391019106
still more the light which had shone for an instant disappeared and all was again in obscurity				1957.6120116987886
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme				194.54764406446455
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear				1176.6401879520338
yes count returned julie we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us one of his angels the count s cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth				2594.609422563054
0159m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that moment we will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderation but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès				540.5959581896118
still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the will of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partner s murmurs and lamentations				40014.99984043339
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her				164.51842588283492
and this carte blanche said d artagnan this carte blanche does it remain in her hands no it passed into mine i will not say without trouble for if i did i should tell a lie my dear athos i shall no longer count the number of times i am indebted to you for my life then it was to go to her that you left us said aramis				151.46885407360074
never sire i entreat you to do so besides in what manner can i make advances first by doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her what is that give a ball you know how much the queen loves dancing				11189.296136990657
full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself well nigh recovered				11202.93123393093
that s another thing said d artagnan and i should not mind waiting in london a whole year for a chance of meeting this mordaunt in question				909.9770159926693
sir said d artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers well that is scarcely the question				909.9765820819184
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one it s true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist				3791.2094704255055
do not let us do things in a hurry				5988.56466427819
help comminges seized the servant around the waist and would have dragged her from her post but at that instant a treble voice proceeding from a kind of entresol was heard screeching murder				10257.608418041285
i want to go into master broussel s house captain replied friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of paris know so well how to assume when necessary				3524.8561632708293
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves				3276.003210730117
an elegant carriage waited below and as it was drawn by two excellent horses they were soon at the place royale				6046.39325159541
the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water				1674.1173391908558
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore				3936.1106871681136
i know how clear sighted your dreams are i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained 400 000 francs by it of which 100 000 have been honestly paid to you				95.69703036450007
20167m as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre				25235.579685105702
there were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs savoring of the man of quality a league off				1166.7088327633978
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed la ramee				1392.4606395690341
there is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said eugénie without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the explanation				3354.107196649121
you who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledge and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl				991.2060592984207
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape				1432.1614948316656
and yours i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor franz d épinay started with surprise				1590.8072639977006
stop and let us talk talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos				145.06382315042276
where have you come from my dear count said albert				433.95085470121
do not be alarmed m noirtier said d avrigny i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to witness and taking barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade				45676.691516356106
my very self dear friend me also repeated porthos				145.16318790118623
ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say d artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question				909.9765820819184
however jacopo insisted on following him and dantès did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust				5948.543961778632
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will please m villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king s attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it still said château renaud dr				36462.92276034807
if you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not so				430.4709725310476
still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good feelings and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness				38771.811776890994
his person had undergone a change analogous to the change in his dress his figure had grown rotund and as it were canonical				59917.38234810254
he saw a corpse at his feet				905.7285633206521
on chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin				14552.746962278363
you are mistaken my lord blood will flow and may that blood fall back on those who cause it to flow felton uttered a cry and rushed toward her				164.2745535332423
the hôtel de la trémouille at these cries all who were in the hôtel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers this cry was generally heeded for the musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his eminence				1735.472378760094
shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron				4526.820764578736
he had tried his strength to the utmost				7918.788934384619
one light alone was visible and dantès saw that it came from mercédès chamber				720.0810844327866
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts				849.4384639190451
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles				4079.867882990379
those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm				830.6472050467497
do you want any money no sir i have all my pay to take nearly three months wages you are a careful fellow edmond say i have a poor father sir yes yes i know how good a son you are so now hasten away to see your father				446.5847791471158
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure				2629.9650040384845
well said he was i mistaken she has answered you cried franz				603.9912341020469
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor				2461.726147154259
obey laporte do you not see i have no time to lose laporte broke the seal and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke but buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing				5099.2757064473635
thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her and the self satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not fail to respond				9264.211166232695
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem				8158.945974108702
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme				194.54996326693131
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room				219.29284735529723
how sir she cried as d artagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me				126.05719410175836
you shall have as much again if you are back within six days and have executed your commission well the messenger without replying a single word bowed took the letter with the order for the two hundred pistoles and retired				794.9899457932663
he confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade the same who was killed to carry off a young woman who was to leave paris by the barrière de la villette but having stopped to drink at a cabaret they had missed the carriage by ten minutes				2962.251191241093
by the bye he said i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for porthos and d artagnan the thing is done dear friend said athos i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself you are a wonderful man my dear count said aramis you think of everything well have you made up your mind to this journey quite and now that i reflect about it i am glad to leave paris at this moment and so am i replied athos my only regret is not having seen d artagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project when supper was over blaisois entered				726.9846291572464
d artagnan quietly pushed him in again and by the light of a lamp on the staircase made him ascend the steps backward one by one keeping his eyes all the time on mordaunt s hands who however knowing that it was useless attempted no resistance				2622.4176044714927
neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it				88.82982576440965
yes look at yourself in that glass you have turned pale and then red successively three or four times in one minute indeed cried eugénie you are very pale oh do not be alarmed i have been so for many days artless as she was the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave and besides madame de villefort came to her assistance				3670.4264221129233
pray relate it to me caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time well my good friend returned the abbé in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end				986.1089840993527
i trust all this will soon be taken away bertuccio bowed				1125.1525059236137
as usual the oldest women were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous				47303.674749130434
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices				18904.884336151437
dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier				15788.588831640134
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon				2109.2597000694573
there was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age				4095.2423511984402
mordaunt one of my secretaries will remit this letter of introduction to his eminence the cardinal mazarin in paris				458.2282839419754
dantès possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry				57124.02393102417
we will cross switzerland and go down into italy by the saint gothard				40743.29238860465
she was now connected by bonds of a political nature with the prince de marsillac the eldest son of the old duc de rochefoucauld whom she was trying to inspire with an enmity toward the duc de condé her brother in law whom she now hated mortally				51482.10171309128
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom				19462.290553938048
i have already told you avenge him on whom on his murderers how should i know who they are order them to be sought for why your brother has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel				5058.3577266918055
no one had entered the house since i had left it				88.86397235929756
their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto				14732.886459287742
our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his majesty was announced				1854.5047940658033
d artagnan turned around and saw the unfortunate man upon his back about four paces off				1166.7260791247172
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d artagnan all for one one for all that s well				642.6657815628071
mind your own business wife replied caderousse sharply				5071.467090823158
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair				1469.8846188238174
besides what does the gospel say				956.534192683021
it will then be said of me that i died for the king so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing				712.482357078624
have you any letters for me inquired d artagnan wishing to signify to the hostess that her lamentations were superfluous and that therefore she had better spare him demonstrations of her grief				1097.5067750035093
the two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men				602.2576298745589
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe				5446.496789246432
during this time madame morrel had told her son everything				1025.4497752979273
madame de bois tracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces i believe for a trustworthy maid				3892.5025396398396

the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness				16656.491602868806
it is well said the abbé we have some hours before us it is now just a quarter past twelve o clock instinctively dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour				1300.280504434733

what do you see a troop of how many persons twenty men what sort of men sixteen pioneers four soldiers how far distant five hundred paces good				1725.3802232581509
d artagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority				67786.66087260851
ah he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still thank god good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty				5050.755955684159
franz was less enthusiastic but the count exercised over him also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less domineering				64545.07000644071
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited d artagnan to drink				4082.0395635589302
oh shall i then again become a fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence				3255.47282084951
france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eighty five departments i say eighty five because i do not include corsica you will not find then in these eighty five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp				52875.694090733334
ah cursed gascon that i am i get from one hobble into another				581.131948319632
the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent				72889.72467874
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule d artagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain l auxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy				54783.86155063073

i demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and i will furnish the house with all necessary information what day do you fix asked the president				1964.970286473526
the young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice				412.82807984788144
yes indeed the marks are recent quite so replied the lieutenant				1940.170027810957
at any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for i have made a rare acquisition 0279m under pretence of being fatigued dantès asked to take the helm the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade				4580.998384392424
but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france he is speculating in railways said lord wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect				49844.27746393229
eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer and escaped				2981.728502497771
i don t ask porthos his opinion has been given why i think said aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token d artagnan may sell it my dear aramis you speak like theology personified				36015.64676928915
prepare yourself maximilian he said with a smile we leave paris tomorrow have you nothing more to do there asked morrel				434.33279726773753
how long will this fuse burn asked this person				1124.1732567840143
you aramis why the devil did you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock				8036.414615757458
mademoiselle eugénie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance				2014.322975158628
d artagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked for nothing had led him to the examination that the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and horses				903.4562481581743
i say sire that there is now but one way open				1289.6197665308482
you have told me yourself madame that i have been drawn into a snare i perhaps may leave my life in it for although it may be strange i have for some time had a presentiment that i should shortly die and the duke smiled with a smile at once sad and charming				6862.008713000302
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity				7506.0510063742695
what the deuce can you expect				6904.37472089485
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step				1544.105842744974
madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child				828.2748906062595
nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose				1160.9666620746632
sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon				3447.3100234936037
as to d artagnan he remained standing like a man in consternation with the deepest affliction depicted on his face				673.0177332989563
in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams				41283.24370104965
come said he laughing there are all my hopes about to be destroyed how so asked beauchamp				761.1743384936361
the prisoners in their expressive language have named it the lions den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers also				1205.0449362078373
about seven o clock in the morning they set out				528.299487402673
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so much				1265.5364963847878
a weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to overthrow a great design				51818.72746445168
i told you on the contrary take away the prisoner said the commissary to the two guards				1703.136843327442
ali observed his master as the nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative				5268.9218169979285
at this instant m de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume				3047.03424808902
the night having come they made an appointment to meet at eleven o clock at the hotel and each started out to fulfill his dangerous mission				4207.081195691699
the comte de la fere athos				154.02025236498187

i know that i must have been mad senseless to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm but what then				889.0220444966063
i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you				95.69693910074358
i am lost said d artagnan to himself				264.43531468389136
indeed the name of bernajoux was known to all the world d artagnan alone excepted perhaps for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not repress				23787.323972386792
no madame answered de winter but the case is provided for and i am come to france to seek allies allies said the queen shaking her head				426.92961660174916

i have heard speak of a mazarin who had not much religion when his oaths were in question				909.9804872861249
nothing but bitter recollections and he let his head sink upon his hands while two large tears rolled down his cheeks				1540.7828785887307
two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea				1716.5307250155872
recollect the ancient romans of the circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred men				602.2648093877705
well have you tied the knot inquired the grave digger who was looking on				528.381869319422
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximilian too rich				3994.558623028631
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind				473.30769416676617
30197m calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile				397.4944035188306
fernand understood nothing except that dantès was absent				6762.791171448279
alas said milady i know it is so				430.7935639606518

you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one				372.09117130056205
well if he is dead said athos he has not been so long for he is still warm				12356.210629689886
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively				9753.001774638104
she was branded athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand				231.96579993971227
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses i scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost me well somewhere about 30 000 francs debray conveyed the count s reply to the baroness				1822.1900488257493
what is this wait your reverence there is a letter you know i have already told you that if you ever call me anything but chevalier i will break every bone in your body				892.1428883114719
i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale				675.7978116800447
grimaud s agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news				3113.2922620758536
please pay to my order from the fund deposited by me the sum of a million and charge the same to my account				1862.9628678445056

it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor man what then is this monsieur scarron who thus puts all paris in commotion				11931.885700466044
but rochefort who had passed five years in prison had become old in the lapse of a few years the dark locks of this estimable friend of the defunct cardinal richelieu were now white the deep bronze of his complexion had been succeeded by a mortal pallor which betokened debility				67377.52522920223
sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison				867.8230835380713

but hast thou nothing to say to thy friend planchet how my friend planchet				662.3330638792313
what is the matter monsieur said planchet				663.2998775505454
look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which m noirtier and barrois partook				59209.10243533331
besides the king i am certain awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king				424.998600706985
goeden morgen mynheer eth teen begeeray le weeten the ge sond heets omstand which means good day sir				538.6827852168657
this morning the subject was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of m d épinay and the following day the contract will be signed a deep sigh escaped the young man who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved				3076.51075208922
i recognize you perfectly the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion				28515.104301340943
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected				6230.91791178421
on being left alone with mme				196.20284655885942
then the general advanced and making a violent effort to control his feelings i have a son said he and i ought to think of him finding myself among assassins general said the chief of the assembly one man may insult fifty it is the privilege of weakness				4324.765628019013
50117m these last consisted of all the young people whom valentine s death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth				7281.166625368284
in contrast with the old man who is dragging his way to the tomb are two children just entering into life valentine the daughter by my first wife mademoiselle renée de saint méran and edward the boy whose life you have this day saved and what is your deduction from this compensation sir inquired monte cristo				202.1432592490653
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries				15429.790479904455
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded				2556.1626677102495
now my wife came home four days ago monsieur				1109.394862586296
my mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside				3777.0232369387877
the royal procession set out for paris				459.20733559731724
he had scarcely gone ten yards in the street when he perceived that he was followed by a man wrapped in a large cloak				2791.9031077876357
we were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the place royale said the wounded man				179.04827261793068
well just as you like my prince there s liberty for all the world				822.2180398994888
they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider s pockets to make him weight but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole lengths and was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged no you say that the horse was entered under the name of vampa exactly that was the title then answered albert i am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that horse was shut up there cried the pit in chorus				8252.17718381174
i pardieu and you would arrest him why not you would arrest the duc de beaufort armed in the field if your eminence should order me to arrest the devil i would seize him by the horns and would bring him in so would i said porthos				145.03864679248733
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct				6163.760475288447
notwithstanding all the pains he took d artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new made friends				429.7070407185371
oh that is very good indeed it is very good said louise looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envy will they go under a man s hat like the one i see down there you shall see said eugénie				1482.8661225168867
he believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was completed				31735.356688920943
in a short time the two unfortunate beasts who had not eaten anything since the morning made such a noise in raising and letting fall the knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged				5371.550910055873
the name of monte cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate to whom valentine s i am coming was the customary signal of farewell				9615.421594453515
determined to put the advice of m de tréville in practice instantly d artagnan directed his course toward the rue des fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his valise				5608.411804679522
yes my lord and that worthy monsieur du vallon are we not to enjoy his society certainly my lord he is waiting in his carriage at the gate of the garden of the palais royal and we start in his carriage then yes my lord and with us no other escort but you two is it not enough				1530.8042744371548
albert rose to return to his place				1079.650485253134
tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative but today i wish to nurse you carefully				10015.997643158822

d avrigny put his hand to his heart and placed a glass before his lips				448.33886226426307
i am really sorry to go away without having seen grimaud grimaud replied athos				152.85649358123746

my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious				46763.89664552043
i have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds i have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood on every occasion i have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and i have preserved lives in exchange for that i took away				594.8438822488977
no country can say it saw my birth				4936.583953172211
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count				288.8551937285099
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d artagnan who however placed himself between him and them				157.7055211204376
the man placed his finger on her lips				448.8421798040794
at ten o clock the king s collation consisting of preserves and other delicacies was prepared in the little room on the side of the church of st jean in front of the silver buffet of the city which was guarded by four archers				15068.407403049223
as d artagnan had foreseen athos was not within				4101.554637823544
at the centre window the one hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which franz s imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina				51380.32584394615
is it you aramis said porthos				146.30960022380478
i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time				473.8406240152029
keep the lieutenancy my dear keep it the young man then entered the apartment of aramis				151.47947166447287
i don t need the quarter of such a sum i who am still only in the guards and by selling my saddles i shall procure it				88.82707257856728

it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time				473.87361310673367
we were merely joking drink to his health he added filling caderousse s glass and do not interfere with us yes yes dantès good health said caderousse emptying his glass here s to his health				9862.068248725067
athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly embarrassed				7666.842852711491
nonsense said d artagnan you would do as much mr				6850.971122514003
however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master				1849.2471579217179
will you this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain				8489.36789984623
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you i am at your command my lord returned d artagnan				80.11410561469643

they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them by chance that is why i have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa				41508.26814155002
30341m then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated				25149.592424329243

meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet				14060.310110060293

he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truth he cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them				157.7055211204376

having recognized the laced hats of his companions and the golden fringe of the cardinal s cloak he waited till the horsemen had turned the angle of the road and having lost sight of them he returned at a gallop to the inn which was opened to him without hesitation				4079.751158703711

signor pastrini who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but franz merely replied that albert had received on the previous evening an invitation which he had accepted				3277.797015488146
he was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around and although teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the sabines no one had ever spoken to her of love because it was known that she was beloved by vampa				1874.6292604636355

but said madame danglars resolving to make a last effort this young man though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate but this is trampling on the weak sir the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us is not death in my house oh sir exclaimed the baroness you are without pity for others well then i tell you they will have no mercy on you be it so said villefort raising his arms to heaven with a threatening gesture				3262.6307123150063

at the moment when the hand of the massive time piece representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden face and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical thought struck nine times the name of the count of monte cristo resounded in its turn and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door				212.24501870049252

20135m from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life				469.1688990815052
he had the resolution to stop with this				1451.469269412059
albert attributed to franz s absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask				3483.381713693652
la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted				2517.583237245109
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance				15887.825013909496
there caressing as he pretended the animal with his hand he put this bit of burning tinder in his ear				1573.2127258897478
we must go and find lord winter they both set off to the other end of the camp but as it did not cover more than a surface of five hundred feet they quickly arrived at the tent they were looking for				1173.858910871726
the races like the moccoli are one of the episodes peculiar to the last days of the carnival				5406.735716947384
if that be the case said d artagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another				581.1047926340658
i shall perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other he will bring his witnesses or will insult me in some public place and i am expected to kill him for all that you admit that you would fight then				889.0207727412802
what are you doing asked rochefort				2045.319181839646
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnestly				52692.56147635652
can i not like pasta malibran grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me whatever might have been your fortune a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which i shall be indebted to no one but myself and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with sour looks and reproaches for my prodigality will be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers				1935.926408911143
five minutes after the door had been closed on morrel s entrance it was again opened for the count				288.85092391648703
all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill turn and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it nonsense returned danglars i tell you again i have nothing whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the paper to pieces no you did not answered caderousse you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a corner hold your tongue you fool what should you know about it why you were drunk where is fernand inquired caderousse				528.750855984908
ah cried blaisois he is lost grimaud s a cunning fellow murmured mousqueton				1067.173436023604
listen then ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them listen continued the abbé				797.9229837064761
you are laughing at him caderousse no he replied only hark how he sighs				4735.424858414489
ah devil take it you speak in earnest and must have a definite answer				803.3996692045225
all three agreed to meet at noon in whitehall place to see how things went on				528.3609577081911
how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpent like forehead round vulture shaped head and sharp hooked nose like the beak of a buzzard				55669.03443283822
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself				767.7213909593688
deliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards named comminges made his appearance with his clothes all torn his face streaming with blood				794.0465948770135
hush cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord				696.325937708056
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron				8803.031325101676
i shall go and die by his side madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some hope no friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself				929.7166619735915
madame broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their father s arms				513.9438750983803
peter on the contrary of whom the popes are the successors continued the jesuit porrige digitos present the fingers				2725.2579812478434
he had been subjected to a severe disciplinary course of medicine at length he sent away all his doctors declaring that he preferred the disease to the treatment and came to paris where the fame of his wit had preceded him				50.33829008099596
so that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st germain				1534.6398195502409
besides to tell truth whilst d artagnan was quite disposed to adopt a subtle course against the cunning of aramis or the vanity of porthos he was ashamed to equivocate with athos true hearted open athos				152.84490488324786
he passed on to another it also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full				16638.313355469818
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess				65608.79239338588
pray put no construction on my words i do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight no said albert the engagement is broken off well said beauchamp				761.1543761639382
she will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies				11298.82173157982
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind				473.3431289323809
villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter				592.0204079496398
it is important that he should receive it before eleven o clock				883.4346229772589
the scotch camp seemed as if at last awakened the soldiers had come out of their tents and taken up their station in battle array				58913.05866795599
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away				594.851257029939
i am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may suppose				27952.90703628027
imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith				71773.08882443605
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well this is a council of state d artagnan remarked to porthos but we held better ones at la rochelle with athos and aramis at the saint gervais bastion said porthos				145.03864679248733
this was a terrible moment for the fugitives				11832.157062511389
contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his incognito was strictly respected				4930.3076167030695
d artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal				410.2706619104002
but listen porthos though monsieur mordaunt was a man not to be despised mazarin is not less strong than he and we shall not easily succeed in drowning him				50.33850610996423
as for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of paris who has the very greatest power at the court of rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to him consider maillard said the curate that i have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that i have made myself responsible for you i know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore i in my turn will be serviceable to you and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le curé told me it was just now i think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever i go they will follow me and could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying down with mazarin as fell those at jericho i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades i will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them i faith exclaimed gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le curé can answer for you i answer for him said the curate				4566.591005827335
during our expedition to béthune the husband of my duchess died so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me i shall marry the widow				8752.56174586403
tomorrow i will see you again to take my leave with these words the baron went out				528.132999263543
the lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner				687.3001597334242
come gentlemen said he they are beating the tattoo				71189.42191992333
come you are no longer twenty years old to my great regret mordieu				57279.0596005236
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse				528.8391081684871
he is here who milady s son athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said i know it grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn me of his presence does grimaud know him then no but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him the headsman of bethune exclaimed de winter				673.7552900724794
bah said he i have travelled through sicily and calabria i have sailed two months in the archipelago and yet i never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate i did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project replied gaetano but you questioned me and i have answered that s all yes and your conversation is most interesting and as i wish to enjoy it as long as possible steer for monte cristo the wind blew strongly the boat made six or seven knots an hour and they were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage				7992.039688270874
ought we to go on asked franz of the count or should we pause let us go on peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming one of the two men was peppino and the other a bandit on the lookout				14555.6339934611
well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him				50.34029438535774
mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwell s permission				4561.681161423261
faith i ve half a mind to do it				88.91767598726629
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them				157.7066491222595
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been				3336.397985522769
it is nearly eight o clock and at nine i expect a visit				1387.065019820841
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction				3795.449298130453
but instead of going to her own room valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden				1366.469226368567
gentlemen said the duke i will thank you later now we have not a moment to lose				2220.2216671435226
alas madame said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of manner i consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable and do you suppose this will be forgotten everything will be forgotten madame said villefort				302.98538162043553
the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of blood it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart				360.6754609213533
about three months ago i was near having a duel with aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house for a handkerchief marked in the same manner i am sure monsieur said the young woman you weary me very much i assure you with your questions but you madame prudent as you are think if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief and that handkerchief were to be seized would you not be compromised in what way				676.9279037773875
lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of d artagnan				80.11891913348576
my uncle answered mordaunt but traitors to england are no longer members of my family cromwell observed the young man a moment in silence then with that profound melancholy shakespeare describes so well mordaunt he said you are a terrible servant when the lord commands said mordaunt his commands are not to be disputed				10503.19420635567
one of the officers went to the place i directed				16406.249906199013
come recover the procureur dropped his head his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly pale				675.7997451558588
a rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of honor				1403.2915067066097
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud very well let us say no more about it				88.82808912955666
the man somewhat crest fallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said				496.5892348038955
on the contrary i think they are poor sir they are friends of yours then yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and i would lay down my life for them very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more i will give them to you i will not even ask who they are do as you like with them thank you sir exclaimed mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should i lose it i should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it				88.82652195163874
i demand the suppression of the thesis since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably				61137.09151665386
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried athos				152.9005969744353
is it heaven that opens before me thought the dying man that angel resembles the one i have lost monte cristo pointed out morrel to the young woman who advanced towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips				448.3125675260103
edmond did not close his eyes				494.4440452570832
out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away				594.844449536501
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast				4396.227742649249
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him				50.339490253662625
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles				1174.8887233561243
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness				15183.375487804313
it remains now for us to keep our word				527.3815597063203
at three o clock came two companies of the guards one french the other swiss				3573.0513583501966
adieu my friend adieu on the contrary said the count after this time you must live with me you must not leave me and in a week we shall have left france behind us and you still bid me hope i tell you to hope because i have a method of curing you count you render me sadder than before if it be possible				849.4238824665638
i let him place the box in the hole he had made then while he stamped with his feet to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming i am giovanni bertuccio thy death for my brother s thy treasure for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped i know not if he heard these words i think he did not for he fell without a cry				1705.3496794732314
you are pale it is this answered athos with a trembling voice				412.86253034472185
limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from				32497.018246875083
he opened the conversation about rain and fine weather the travelers replied				5912.443360441744
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz ah indeed so franz must wait				3413.307398219869
the two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities				69003.10194415085
villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him				50.834101031044824
for any other son to have stayed with his mother for four days at tréport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i return more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my companion 30279m that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make everyone vow to live a single life such are my reasons for not liking to marry mademoiselle danglars				455.0963467546834
thanks for the comparison said albert with a bow				2314.783093861217
danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated were they alone there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named caderousse but he was very drunk				6359.334328942113
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room				219.26095674602925
are you satisfied sir there is one thing the queen has not signed her assent to the treaty of what use to day				483.1157952945387
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary				65896.61552614984
d avrigny cried villefort i can not tell you all i feel at this moment terror grief madness yes said m d avrigny with an imposing calmness but i think it is now time to act				2233.7120103347247
and having done so entirely on my own account be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with yanina				10150.283548178197
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost				1014.4660664024751
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber the two travelers consulted for a moment				574.0995156176217
19 in the old greek legend the atreidae or children of atreus were doomed to punishment because of the abominable crime of their father				446.5901028842723
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort				303.0847965123498
of course you stopped at your father s a feeling of faintness came over villefort				303.0018521825685
this major cavalcanti is an old friend of yours then by no means				1768.2337978954781
the conference being finished the queen summoned him to her cabinet				8467.407366763431
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne				26792.571258261265
it is true the cardinal had been particularly ill tempered				40699.87471921266
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief				1097.5072983356458
20043m there s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it rose				5499.568152792884
now my dear host while your young man was insensible you did not fail i am quite sure to ascertain what that pocket contained				10710.483935177255
my dear beauchamp i wish you to contradict this statement beauchamp looked at albert with a benevolent expression				1763.2980978380326
the duke was in full strength and beat la ramee completely				32786.77193610032
he tells me he served your illustrious father and that he owes his fortune to him wretch exclaimed haydée her eyes flashing with rage he sold my father to the turks and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery				13414.279466086773
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear				1176.552664948245
come come continued d arminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast				4396.244512959185
not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy				8353.146727647281
why did you not say so at once my dear sir				538.7354449041461
what is going on asked franz of the count for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it				88.82732671522399
as this was the height of d artagnan s worldly ambition apart be it well understood from his desire of finding mme				194.55051987963722
anne of austria at the age of forty six				4814.636814985471
come sir said he addressing broussel silence that woman and follow me silence me				126.0703586062847
gentlemen said athos a wager ah wooi a vager cried the swiss				3573.0377282669474
he was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like lucius brutus have kissed his mother earth it was dark but at eleven o clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion				78927.43916811385
the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life perhaps franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment				574.0992418657054
absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance but his father a sun pluribus impar left his personal splendor to each of his favorites his individual value to each of his courtiers				22220.317668845804
i am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter s hand				231.9692288723535
ah what is that cried the brigadier				14044.884868507836
monsieur du vallon i commend his eminence to your care be quite at ease said porthos holding out his hand which d artagnan took and shook in his				1112.7028650490822
7 dr guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an execution in italy				1960.2554927996293
they merit richly that piece of attention on your part the advice is good monsieur and tomorrow i will set out tomorrow				1440.3496591461317
his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him				50.34028238329771
they were within fifteen miles of monte cristo when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief this mass of rock like the giant adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow				4061.5830046377223
in fact at half past eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawing rooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen				3037.123919262817
you will not oppose m villefort you will not displease the marchioness and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband but mon dieu tell me how can i do otherwise do not appeal to me mademoiselle i shall be a bad judge in such a case my selfishness will blind me replied morrel whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation				49670.45977603216
eugénie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the count of monte cristo the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly				48960.16667412432
what she cried wringing her beautiful hands what				670.5796390699804
keep your ill humor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them not so replied danglars your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it				88.82660666325174
how did this happen said morrel				435.72117213863476
i find that i have not been mistaken and i thank you that there is still one man in france of whom may be said without disappointment what i have said of you that s well said cried the king who had heard all these compliments through the open door only tell him tréville since he wishes to be considered your friend that i also wish to be one of his but he neglects me that it is nearly three years since i have seen him and that i never do see him unless i send for him				50.3382780794138
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my child				828.2875291745255
she was pale and fair with long curls falling in profusion over her shoulders had large blue languishing eyes rosy lips and hands of alabaster				78412.16676517852
which route must i take demanded d artagnan in his turn				1019.587678044656
he started and the prisoner saw that start for though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her				164.27917519871863
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net				50231.71381277604
bazin gone the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be sure that nobody could either see or hear him and opening his ragged vest badly held together by a leather strap he began to rip the upper part of his doublet from which he drew a letter				592.0198433552512
franz questioned albert as to his intentions but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor				59129.594989243335

as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets				68904.98848541916
would you like to hear the story sir yes relate it said monte cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own history				3588.739880844208
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was				868.4833620126782

this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction				4026.4105250066773
ah perbacco indispensable were they certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child true said the major there might be doubts raised in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated it would be fatal to his interests it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance o peccato you must know that in france they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity that is the misfortune				4379.501940670135
and why not demanded d artagnan				80.95270607148524
d artagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey				1052.158545482886

a few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered				727.015135286333
alas my friends replied m morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected oh indeed indeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth mercédès				1363.1586389284741
when they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their feet				905.3615354269036
in an instant and as the moon broke from behind a cloud they saw at a turning of the road two horsemen who on perceiving them stopped in their turn appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go back				804.0653736026137
it is you mordaunt he said				498.68190219817217
the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said s accommodi the italian s accommodi is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master it is like that turkish phrase of molière s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance				13973.061676536765
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself				264.23402148028606
you must be cruelly bored here that was my intention but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you what s that it is that as i was cruelly bored as you say and as i had the seventy five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed a cast of dice				4648.082521131585
i am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living athos was for a few moments thoughtful				11523.594068754037
the major will bring his son with him this evening the contino as we say in italy he confides him to my care				1487.7807161198157

your hand athos and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection m de tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might without perceiving that athos whatever might be his self command allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him and if possible grew paler than he was before				775.2102989351009
he examined the bullets with which monte cristo performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot				71415.99627103745
this sleep provincial as it was brought him to nine o clock in the morning at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence of m de tréville the third personage in the kingdom in the paternal estimation				49757.69606591721

the day had begun to break when athos arose and dressed himself				264.26212021597314
but although her voice sweet full and sonorous vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut				7616.383622475404
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution well then i will content myself with arresting you madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should i not have returned by to morrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times that he has there met de beaufort de bouillon the coadjutor and d elbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him your pardon madame i know all that				539.1764469639019

and in what have i been so unfortunate as to displease your majesty asked m de tréville feigning the most profound astonishment				893.6726853377726
that of a lieutenant of musketeers d artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal and said taking the commission from his pocket here my friend write your name upon it and become my chief porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to d artagnan to the great astonishment of the young man				179.04246708492744

put back that weapon d artagnan said he this woman must be tried not assassinated				9233.903651260007
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him				50.33829008099596
well morrel let us both examine the depths of your heart				360.7507975445593

one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st louis that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably ancient it is possible said morcerf my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified d hozier and jaucourt				101170.34186865606
d artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed quietly				2383.1134909268844
can this be another vengeance of that woman it was now athos who turned pale				675.8300369991541
so au revoir dear athos au revoir said the musketeer making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought				13888.049860779854

i have my sword and no one waiting for you outside no then you had better come with me thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it				88.82652195163874
since the death of madame de saint méran i have known that a poisoner lived in my house				465.2954307330328
athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not d artagnan				80.11391460801185
glad he cried i should be more than glad				110835.43484284585
i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen				1703.0434522108494
but listen they appear to be speaking of me d artagnan drew near the window and lent his ear				1573.214976390214

why did you not come down to breakfast				3914.130166049138
really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with man that is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really do not understand you perfectly i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king and that the men whom god has put above those office holders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fill i say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation				5193.204188519006
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart				360.7232754928363
at eleven o clock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved court and the rue du faubourg saint honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess				4095.902438529481
m de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king				425.0016405447313
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pasha s misfortunes who then urged you to write				2308.33721153445
they had formed a circle round the invalid the second notary was sitting at a table prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have alluded				67467.35098537433
ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may to be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said aramis				151.46928743008826
soldiers are big children but as i maintain that the orders of the king and more particularly the orders of the cardinal should be executed d artagnan could not restrain a smile				397.4949721395426
ah said louise breathing freely here we are out of paris yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied eugénie				1482.8731933904235

in that case replied the major it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some time before they could be obtained it would be a difficult matter to arrange said monte cristo				202.14335563850557
reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office my father died because he could not do what i have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what i should do my father my father cried the young man why should you not live if i live all would be changed if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility if i live i am only a man who has broken his word failed in his engagements in fact only a bankrupt				21313.121799072687
what are these things he asked				862.3105057553953
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door				212.41875980348692
therefore athos had invented the phrase family affair				1232.7702806041837
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated				7835.083154026322
i beg you to do so i beg you to excuse me madame i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken				2021.4345849161707
but d artagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it				88.82677608672009
perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i say that you are very culpable d artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis				151.46885407360074
bring the prisoner in again said the cardinal				410.41056284986945
in ten minutes d artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt				10252.48371174801
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream				67877.0320765159

i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you visit your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap a faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of valentine who almost instantly said in a saddened tone as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart alas no maximilian this must not be for many reasons				9771.948069642993
they went over a tolerably large ground floor a first floor consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near one of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to the garden				1366.469226368567
d artagnan fancied quite naturally according to his custom that he must be the object of their conversation and listened				6071.551874944318
and what do you believe his voice was stifled by sobs				5274.09994025118
how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought gondy				1553.199152177377
during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself				1888.656602952164
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar				77272.36498094836
this was neither long nor difficult				15597.96572468455
the stranger looked at him again with a slight smile and retiring from the window came out of the hostelry with a slow step and placed himself before the horse within two paces of d artagnan				80.11391460801185
you will take it to the count and say that although in haste to attend the chamber my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him i never speak to his excellency replied the concierge the valet de chambre will carry your message the groom returned to the carriage				673.3711588342037

the very circumstances which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here such painful emotions are to me on the contrary a source of something like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation				49757.69606591721
now as ever i am nothing but your servant then turning to his men allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the duc de beaufort long live the duc de beaufort cried the sentinels				4643.359603359454
you yes you have them i have them ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the papers feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48 000 francs ah indeed that is a fortunate circumstance yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them i do not at all wonder at it one can not think of everything but happily the abbé busoni thought for you he is an excellent person he is extremely prudent and thoughtful he is an admirable man said the major and he sent them to you here they are the major clasped his hands in token of admiration				1480.7732131205064
he paused exchanged two words with the sentinel then the door opened and he appeared				1102.8756440670356
the devil take you said aramis				152.88951525574282
everything was as athos had foreseen				5954.208284557869
for the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance in order to watch the shore of the mediterranean				15997.568064704265
really if the house had not belonged to the father in law of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off				1166.7088327633978
i my lord said d artagnan why should i because you shrug your shoulders it is a way i have of speaking to myself				767.7224891944134

in those times panics were common and few days passed without some city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind				5743.7937669079565
ghosts at first sight the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside				4826.5207316667875
ah said beauchamp you doubt me				126.76654228510768
i hope it does not exceed she stopped speech failed her				164.32069768533418
why have we not a grimaud near every prince patience replied mazarin with his italian smile that may happen one day but in the meantime well in the meantime i shall still take precautions and he wrote to d artagnan to hasten his return				1260.4788161958718
for an instant without an exclamation without a cry for help athos tried to sustain himself on the surface of the waters but the weight dragged him down he disappeared by degrees soon nothing was to be seen except his long floating hair then both men disappeared and the bubbling of the water which in its turn was soon effaced alone indicated the spot where these two had sunk				76883.43912866549
this noise redoubled when d artagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church				2675.4742751849226
i have filled those papers and have made out the accusation against the assassin benedetto				4358.681028470539
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name edmond dantès				540.5969892955569
no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence renée uttered a smothered exclamation				5696.6716786361285
sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction				4026.4911633845586
luigi vampa comes to take us and we take him we bring him back to rome and present him to his holiness the pope who asks how he can repay so great a service then we merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses and we see the carnival in the carriage and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol and proclaim us like curtius and horatius cocles the preservers of their country whilst albert proposed this scheme signor pastrini s face assumed an expression impossible to describe				15023.16573310354
valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear eugénie				1483.4418019669731
as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea table he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow				2315.5746355471906
that i believe answered m morrel but still he is charged with what inquired the elder dantès				540.6044648724751

they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to d artagnan				80.11888092981715
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock				2016.0651219283725
bonacieux and your regiment your captain by my soul you had made me forget all that dear constance				19880.759178634475
milady therefore continued her voyage and on the very day that planchet embarked at portsmouth for france the messenger of his eminence entered the port in triumph				5624.062204753783
you know there s only one way of saying things so i went in and said my lord we were not the strongest party yes i know that he said but give me the particulars you know porthos i could not give him the particulars without naming our friends to name them would be to commit them to ruin so i merely said they were fifty and we were two				1157.7895238745702
beauchamp interposed this strange man the count of monte cristo bows to none but the count of monte cristo himself				264.23402148028606
he could not help thinking of m rochefort whom he had seen in notre dame could de rochefort have forestalled him with athos				152.8460710017777
a carriage waits your orders and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go				1838.1576460578242
as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly				2383.1282636145124
he will not go today said d artagnan but here i ll pay you for us two in that case let us go said the shipmaster				109062.88777464726
then a piercing cry escaped from his breast and he cried still the hand of god the presence of the two victims alarmed him he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses				110370.37795060419
how do i know that this is not his eminence who has honored you with the commission to procure my head				426.93124521209654

she thought that lord de winter had hastened her departure she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening				752.9857668409451

what joy for my lord and master du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds thou good mousqueton				1067.2029507727557
monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilian s room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still				4772.3513414603385
live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is summed up in these two words wait and hope your friend edmond dantès count of monte cristo 50282m during the perusal of this letter which informed valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother she became pale a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom and tears not the less painful because they were silent ran down her cheeks her happiness cost her very dear				17420.01545019868
at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank				11258.013749873826

nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us you re right yes let us go on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate				1067.7801790352303
a large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside her				164.2756501878606
his fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king				424.998600706985
then as the wheels rolled over a fine gravel milady could hear a vast roaring which she at once recognized as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff				88680.26940944612
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother s bed				692.0627746114501
one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak				2791.956359621239

he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the world but the hackney coach drove on and the head of neither mercédès nor her son appeared at the window to take a last look at the house or the deserted father and husband				1430.3720294226512
having been brought up on the banks of the loire he might have been said to have been cradled on its waves a hundred times he had crossed it on horseback a thousand times had swum across				83737.92928849878

while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief				1097.5072983356458
my good fellow you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert s side				823.4873460508468
she remembered that she had a son said he and i forgot i had a daughter then shaking his head sorrowfully poor haydée said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed something				3241.599793548489
athos you have done wrong but my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the musketeer				997.7072342585318

this is a detail preserved to us by brienne				67895.6776206381
now since d artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way				676.9279037773875
no one must know this secret my dear but yourself				929.8523288470898
but monsieur de tréville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers monseigneur is correctly informed said d artagnan				80.11383820546554

diplomat or not i don t know i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly				91796.02683834931

then he stepped into his coupé calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes				2962.228591144267
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say on but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well i think i may venture to ask you this favor you may venture to ask me anything well then my dear count present me to your princess i will do so but on two conditions i accept them at once the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview very well said albert extending his hand i swear i will not the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers i give you my oath that i will not enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not				591.6425324729497

albert placed it in his button hole and the carriage went triumphantly on				528.4005141044364
thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily the friends embraced				60479.93802197662
he had seen in his province that land in which heads become so easily heated a few of the preliminaries of duels but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in gascony				69565.79182699122
i promised you a letter for the director of the academy				54984.644096702286
we are not such devils as we appear to be				833.7400230983241
that renders it useless to get a pleurisy by too much haste oh i comprehend now said the astonished porthos				145.04224314751454
the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day				483.1141827242896

do you know modern greek asked he				209.20849469334323
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st sebastian encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous luigi vampa				1874.6292604636355
one of us would suffice really my dear monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence and bernouin do i not take him with me there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish my lord there is time to draw back said d artagnan and your eminence is perfectly free not at all not at all said mazarin let us be off and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of d artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling				3720.35652721958

i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court				908.089727956375
at the moment he re entered the sentinel who guarded the door put his head through the opening curious as to what the king was doing				2779.2103063904815

yes betrayed by the scotch amongst whom i was born whom i have always loved better than the english				3582.506103732667
monseigneur let your eminence be reassured				8197.318334701355
for a moment d artagnan thought that parry s brother had disappeared but he was mistaken				2021.4480794929352
all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the 28th of february 1815 not quite twenty six murmured the voice at that age he can not be a traitor oh no no cried dantès				540.5959581896118
despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air				1218.7631036740563
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone				778.663837555492
in spite of this recommendation which owing to the noise could scarcely have been heard two or three musket shots resounded succeeded by a terrible discharge				82359.46044350155
he called it using his advantages				16167.613941482257
this is the order he said				498.8250723628913
i would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being governor of the bastile he had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived				1867.78918690876

have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges				70397.96206670659
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced				1854.5640428975653
all is over but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss did you not see his face asked athos				152.84490488324786
yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition and villefort s father extended his hand to the bell rope to summon the servant whom his son had not called				2799.8755422295826
when the chill of the night had driven away the guests from the gardens and the gates of the villa were closed on them for the festa in doors he took teresa quite away and as he left her at her home he said teresa what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young countess of san felice i thought replied the young girl with all the frankness of her nature that i would give half my life for a costume such as she wore and what said your cavalier to you he said it only depended on myself to have it and i had only one word to say he was right said luigi				80169.60091908743
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure together till tomorrow then said aramis for iron nerved as you are you must need repose the next morning when d artagnan entered aramis s chamber he found him at the window				533.2705492730045
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper				9608.574058297207
paradise is at noisy le sec upon the site of the archbishop s chateau				4708.405915562319
d artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him				50.338602123136596
why it seems to me replied morrel that in delivering m de morcerf whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society of which he is the brightest ornament said beauchamp drinking off a glass of champagne				6443.543940874889
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple				16759.536479264385
let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the right to alienate a part of his fortune and having alienated it all the will will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void yes said villefort but i warn m d épinay that during my life time my father s will shall never be questioned my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained 40032m sir said franz i regret much that such a question has been raised in the presence of mademoiselle valentine i have never inquired the amount of her fortune which however limited it may be exceeds mine				1527.8595949649916
no object affects me and i even feel here at the bottom of my heart something which speaks for you				95.69899255631671
well then with well acted good humor i allow grimaud but no one else you must manage it all				335.648618537918
the plan adopted by d artagnan was soon perfected				72123.57496235166
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting of course of course said the prisoners anyone can see he s a gentleman well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade 50151m i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper				10779.395939069322

he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis				151.4707319606678
d artagnan said athos taking his hand you know i love you if i had a son i could not love him better				1072.62712236576
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued				3389.193941899472
oh my god cried she my god				570.0856265150784
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his departure				2319.548572336611
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house				465.29853692551364
he resembles the old conventionalist of 93 who said to napoleon in 1814 you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth				82805.30101377175
three blows were struck upon the panel of the door				212.35212199232
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew				18019.221638859446
which is to recover a lost and adored son a lost and adored son stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies at the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven				741.5889886299171
the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition				17360.9237072149

never fear quarrels but seek adventures				12984.936312945307
memory makes the one philosophy the other but can not one learn philosophy philosophy can not be taught it is the application of the sciences to truth it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven well then said dantès what shall you teach me first				1026.5427220193646
ah sir the poor fellow told you the truth and for that reason he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should any foul spot or stain have fallen on it and here the look of the abbé becoming more and more fixed seemed to rest with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse				528.7506038569126
if these five men give themselves up we gag them if they resist we kill them				157.7150717908915
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly				7267.202040478819
the other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending				37884.86231323915
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another				581.098696634166
what is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the wind swayed cloth he was holding back				804.0803266633143
de villefort is here well he comes to fetch his wife and daughter why so because madame de saint méran is just arrived in paris bringing the news of m de saint méran s death which took place on the first stage after he left marseilles				1472.561671308584
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms				513.9639710292837

you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or lost ah said groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all i can understand that said d artagnan				80.11383820546554

the island of monte cristo thus at length by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny dantès was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural means and land on the island without incurring any suspicion				5675.182247509898
the rendezvous d artagnan ran home immediately and although it was three o clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse he met with no misadventure				112513.86285860694
i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said danglars				455.0963467546834

an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms				103520.74570876718
he was called benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents sign it continued the count				288.84734283248946

oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father				446.5847791471158
she listened at eugénie s door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place				1078.9402708442774
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old man s happiness was centred in his granddaughter				14868.020735049888
it is the face of the count of monte cristo exclaimed the procureur with a haggard expression				1763.3039834902338
the sun is not shining said morrel more alarmed by noirtier s expression than by valentine s indisposition				23526.521458492076
morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in law s gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance				1217.6129666642146
do you understand the meaning of my words				833.2535538104004
i supplicate you i implore you on my knees let me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself				264.2318795467692
who are these gentleman three of the king s musketeers				844.9801412572937
although my name or rather that of my brother would be mixed up with the affair i will risk the scandal of a public trial to make myself certain of getting rid of you milady made no reply but became as pale as a corpse				2095.6204422328356
the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating the notary the notary m de villefort left the room and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother				168608.79607389335
the clock of the invalides struck one				372.802978275633
one is for seven o clock and the other for eight there will be time for both hum				126874.01429177483
besides d artagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her				164.2756501878606
in case i should be killed said de guiche				2475.1738952149653
jacopo seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade				4580.985278069665
i have told you my wish or rather my determination				113856.96970866341
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him what did you refuse to dine with him said old dantès and did he invite you to dine yes my dear father replied edmond smiling at his father s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son				1000.8210695688003
at this moment a shot was fired and a ball passed through the hat of comminges and broke the arm of one of the guards				1703.1084194019961
no its odor charms one of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it				88.82817384266424
but andrea drew a cigar case from his pocket took a havana quietly lit it and began smoking				124538.88028873673
i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet oh answered another voice which d artagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis				151.46885407360074
if she seduced your brother you said she seduced him did you not yes if she caused his death you said that she caused his death yes repeated the executioner				1704.0913504454172
sir said he that man has been here what man said andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected				161666.66239978027
by no means said d artagnan				80.99513997201527
now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust yet five minutes afterwards the rabbit was dead				624.8629995114744
that s a snare said athos don t go d artagnan and yet replied d artagnan i think i recognize the writing it may be counterfeit said athos				152.84519641204625
the fact is one can not remain thus with a sword hanging eternally over his head said athos				152.8488405689429
so call me mercédès if you please we must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dantès he is so easily mistaken so then the wedding is to take place immediately m dantès said danglars bowing to the young couple				16759.536479264385
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence				714.0346100551266
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke				666.1681334915786
m noirtier was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the room in the morning and in the same way drawn out again at night				877.9434366228877
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided				160792.99597236747
the novice seeing milady in bed was about to follow the example of the superior but milady stopped her				164.27815685447922
i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal who did the plate in my presence				1698.0573201454415
he was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living				4567.422894336182
and then philosophic ideas are wholly wanting in voiture s works but i am of the same opinion as the coadjutor he is a poet a true poet aramis spoke so as to be heard by everybody				7608.325348502093
the château d if cried he what are we going there for the gendarme smiled				559.3060801182676
you don t like playing then on the contrary i do lansquenet for instance devoted to it				88.83185894103812
availing himself of a handle that projected from a half fallen door he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief from his pocket wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow then advancing to the door struck thrice with the end of his iron shod stick				126152.15366567565
the ceremony of reception over the four friends were soon in one another s arms				513.9713233954527
instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your course you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend help cried caderousse i require a surgeon not a priest perhaps i am not mortally wounded i may not die perhaps they can yet save my life your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead				624.8621056384229
i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information sir replied the mayor				28422.712704922964
but what can i do with you				96.00041480650732
only grazed a little replied d artagnan my fingers were caught between two stones that of the wall and that of my ring and the skin was broken that comes of wearing diamonds my master said athos disdainfully				9867.33656806234
remain here and i will send you your clothes by the boy				1840.77060053221
he found the cardinal dressed as an officer and he looked very well in that costume which as we have already said he wore elegantly only he was very pale and trembled slightly				48960.260058320346
oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of milady				406.6189053003793
on the following morning at five o clock d artagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mother s recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor d artagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow				3123.9009574683123
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach				26491.82021874759
but go on signing said monte cristo i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and i beg to apologize to you baroness and to mademoiselle danglars the baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary				2135.561380452742
the usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word				527.3317699821794
valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction				12009.228919879659
now sir said the count you are safe calm yourself ah				256.57755873124034
sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords but it was too late				2104.027127561204
doctor d avrigny said barrois staggering as if he would fall				1751.1067104599013
here i am back again and we are going to be happy yes yes my boy so we will so we will replied the old man but how shall we be happy				2734.213252109843
or s blood my brave athos will die at the cries of m de tréville the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet he not thinking to shut the door against anyone and all crowded round the wounded man				179.04255245904898
adieu faltered the count who felt his heart die away within him adieu and think of me oh				1081.7308050331162
ah said i after four hours work since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once is that the example you set penelon cries the captain very well wait a minute he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols				8079.078671438686
all these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket				120909.41840820128
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also				1205.0133330610931
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh				1081.693667390733
i only ask a brokerage of course that is perfectly just cried m de boville				49899.59157936391
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness				1135.614052088465
this one will not oppress you by his dignity tis the same thing you understand me d artagnan a court there s no court now				1201.9328505640544
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea				1716.5348175486301
a letter from charles the first				1028.5295392417436
yes monsieur said d artagnan bowing we have had that honor				1403.4815557704173
monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively				18701.803396554606
this man except a sword had all the appearance of a soldier and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day				483.1141827242896
tis well said porthos we shall remember that but see there is a postscript from aramis so there is said d artagnan and he read we conceal the place where we are dear friends knowing your brotherly affection and that you would come and die with us were we to reveal it confound it interrupted porthos with an explosion of passion which sent mousqueton to the other end of the room are they in danger of dying d artagnan continued athos bequeaths to you raoul and i bequeath to you my revenge				10256.385688711076
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear				4815.279681266728
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on end				986.1870426140106
salute my hero viscount and he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing with large and open brow piercing eyes and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten				5114.4758899337685
i will write to him then nearly in these terms let us see said athos assuming in advance a critical look				945.3929365776089
do you see that ray of sunlight i do well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you				95.69771484544808
two hours passed away without anything fresh happening				112799.97011965829
this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man who a rather improbable thing had stolen his father s letter from him was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred				3839.0683563436387
50265m give way said the traveller				17843.071075461903
well then said milady i confide in my brother i will dare to at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard but this time the terrible brother in law of milady did not content himself as on the preceding day with passing before the door and going away again				391.9701481468536
planchet two hours before had asked his master for some dinner and he had answered him with the proverb he who sleeps dines and planchet dined by sleeping				13082.722888741499
i think i learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal continued milady that would have been another motive for sympathy between us what i have heard then from our good mother is true you have likewise been a victim of that wicked priest hush said milady let us not even here speak thus of him				50.3382780794138

in fact a moment later m morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own				1169.353280608978
d artagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them				157.7301886010441

it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit				1387.0742795097406
at least delay the trial till the next assizes we shall then have six months before us no madame said villefort instructions have been given				3037.3904022441266

two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets				144213.65705910357

i had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality				147286.0921206676
to think of the parisians soliloquized d artagnan offering only the other day by an edict of the parliament six hundred thousand francs to any man soever who would deliver up the cardinal to them dead or alive if alive in order to hang him if dead to deny him the rites of christian burial come said anne tis reasonable since you only ask from a queen the sixth of what the parliament has proposed and she signed an order for a hundred thousand francs				741.7262047910266

two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there				485.7519158608458
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention				886.0798407351996
if caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond and there existed no such person as the abbé busoni then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my life hung upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and confessing the whole truth				2252.388729649677
if anything yet remains of that great that sublime king henry of whom you have just spoken he would be much surprised at so little pity for his family being united to such a profound admiration of himself the perspiration stood in large drops on mazarin s brow				1392.3092610478982
