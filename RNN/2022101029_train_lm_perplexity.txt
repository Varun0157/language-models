i am acquainted with it before we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment a false letter altogether said porthos we have not been disciplined d artagnan said aramis in a reproachful tone how could you believe that we had made a disturbance d artagnan grew pale and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs				3586.560417386429
no replied mousqueton parry kept it				71.35856376446705
then you are going with me i will accompany you a portion of the way said athos				14.377488995055577
then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons				14272.496321813645
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him				12.628439528542382
porthos kill every one who stands in your way and after pressing the hand of athos d artagnan chose a moment when the ship rolled backward so that he had only to plunge into the water which was already up to his waist				12883.776154058844
at the same time couriers started in every direction over england and europe to announce that charles stuart was the prisoner of oliver cromwell				3551.3502433724047
the latter and the coadjutor touched the brush with the tips of their fingers and made the sign of the cross the coadjutor threw a piece of money into the hat which was on the ground				1379.857310270668
tomorrow then monsieur tomorrow till then god preserve your majesty however ill the king might sleep m de tréville slept still worse				5223.363768699742
i did go to monsieur d artagnan s what was the aim of that visit to beg him to assist me in finding my wife				904.2785914685517
he had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the procureur s footstep was heard in the passage				1790.6953844636894
here is a letter i have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over				1976.6476472827383
i wish to see everything if your majesty wishes to look out well then look replied d artagnan				1.4269900501203348
i thank you d artagnan you are more impetuous than you were returned d artagnan				3.720369918896421
i must divert my attention amuse yourself with milady my dear d artagnan i wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse you hear me athos said d artagnan				1.43888628165767
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from you your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well well i must tell you				24.201121692100376
you did not let the executioner escape then the executioner is still in the cellar where i presume he has had an interview with mine host s bottles				3357.8325809316257
in ten minutes the masters slept not so the servants hungry and more thirsty than hungry				4884.699783461608
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot afoot my lord i have served always in the infantry				9031.827594905268
the house may be suspected but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur d artagnan for i can affirm sire if i can believe what he says that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal was it not this d artagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmes déchaussés asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vexation				8013.187635154595
taste the hashish guest of mine taste the hashish franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth				4321.586870601289
it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance see that now said porthos and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him				25.73167248991439
you were not certain my child was dead and you buried it				17.6930988373998
will you tell me what you require in order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject in order to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client				6153.740385265026
here said milady rising with the majesty of a queen here felton behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl the victim of the brutality of a villain				37794.21282963465
d artagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head				415.5571585728895
it is generally the case that what we most ardently desire is as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it				103.55549283549314
we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe				4753.491836189843
the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies but the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber each on a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground				998.1673846725959
it is my fault madame said raoul				255.238930419233
come one may easily see vicomte that you are lately from the provinces and have never so much as seen him				11.209435900134856
he arrived valentine was expecting him				11.71983808196129
i would almost answer for planchet well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him twice why good god				601.5045438960783
there now said eugénie while i change my costume do you lock the portmanteau louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands on the top of the portmanteau				5884.559052553437
well what have you to say				673.9435815109658
a few minutes afterwards a flash of light which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the sound of firearms reached the yacht				4631.900164162921
a few hundred yards beyond the town d artagnan drew rein				21694.657684837413
was the gascon determined to keep it as a weapon against milady or else let us be frank did he not reserve the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit				14085.649025165665
the third attack will either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for life no no cried dantès you are mistaken you will not die				942.1913894273675
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages				5919.473163839179
it may be judged whether d artagnan looked or listened with avidity				31198.386042933525
at the lesser gate of the castle he s posted there are you a large party sixty let him know this moment sir and believing that no one could execute the commission better than himself grimaud set off at full speed whilst enchanted at being all together again the friends awaited his return				1210.369511108619
we loved sporting of all kinds better than anything so that he related to me how in the plains of the pampas the natives hunt the tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such nicety but in face of the proof i was obliged to acknowledge the truth of the recital				2014.7715804933187
who has told me this fine story monsieur				852.4845766048687
my dear said villefort in answer to his wife you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod				24728.039775866655
she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her				409.4182006845081
or the holy blood i will spit you all like ortolans unfortunately there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat which was as we have related that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two and which he had entirely forgotten				1636.5401102602018
and why have you such an air of sadness aboard a great misfortune m morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially				18029.98232812426
oh valentine you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him answer soon and do you said valentine depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa yes cried morrel make haste				1267.460564617375
do you know of what he died asked d avrigny placing his hand on noirtier s shoulder				807.2705198268233
oh yes and with all my heart for i know what it is to be in love you know what it is to be in love said d artagnan looking at her for the first time with much attention				1170.5532743525116
as he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention				1046.8174156839063
m noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m noirtier try noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself				479.2939900264974
if you arrive safely at home what have i to fear except from you if you reach your home safely leave paris leave france and wherever you may be so long as you conduct yourself well i will send you a small annuity for if you return home safely then then asked caderousse shuddering				2673.604656436633
in an instant he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each end all carved as things were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals precious				5127.197688807081
athos had even gone so far as to question m de tréville a thing which considering the habitual reticence of the worthy musketeer had very much astonished his captain				1067.8535001988105
how did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have just left he is not a prince simply a count a count and a rich one too eh yes but you had better not have anything to say to him for he is not a very good tempered gentleman oh be easy				1953.7969403666796
monseigneur will be with him in an hour good said friquet my fortune is made by the way said bazin where was he carried to the tower saint jacques la boucherie and delighted with the success of his embassy friquet started off at the top of his speed				2570.0686977463397
d artagnan drew his sword and sprang toward the door				260.86474041869565
d artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly				2239.885422062279
milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment then as if appearing to have formed a resolution she said i have an enemy you madame said d artagnan affecting surprise is that possible my god good and beautiful as you are a mortal enemy indeed an enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is war to the death				614.2922023705248
the justice of the court is supreme and impartial as that of god it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself				2712.305511873178
oh my mother it was you who said you were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen				500.35923437851494
he walked to the window and looked into the court				1162.7650132462072
and now farewell farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror				701.6992853816552
he wished to subdue this woman in his own name and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce it				23.961350736446555
come calm yourself and reckon them up m				474.2775766901188
him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity oh said andrea my father s old servant				992.0567104443497
villefort became pale he understood the old man s meaning				1262.6474400996524
in particular there is one yonder of a gascon look				1267.845608243134
however the morning of the appointment the young man had established himself in the small salon downstairs				2538.016199424312
the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness				8516.516935327867
in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal s guards who recognized d artagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning				1546.6584486293136
in five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intact a piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of favor				2982.8121101468187
you are punctual said he as he drew back the door				250.40339474218294
you have seen the count you say i have only just left him and has he conformed to all that the letter specified he has do you understand it not in the least there is a dupe somewhere at all events it is neither you nor i certainly not well then why it does not much concern us do you think it does no i agree with you there				607.4815382087835
believe me we are as well informed as you and our police are as good as your own				912.0021585225376
upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renée it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for don t you see renée the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale i don t know anything about that replied renée but m de villefort you have promised me have you not always to show mercy to those i plead for make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and i will always consult upon our verdicts my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand				1488.9780045593245
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands				407.15206701492144
to return instantly to england and to inform him as soon as the duke leaves london and as to my other instructions asked the fair traveler				14636.885278530079
petition the minister oh i know what that is the minister receives two hundred petitions every day and does not read three that is true but he will read a petition countersigned and presented by me and will you undertake to deliver it with the greatest pleasure				1641.2986461619128
what are you looking at asked d artagnan				1.5942414773353586
the count pretends i have not him to thank so be it i will erect an altar deo ignoto listen said monte cristo i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the father in law and the young man there is only mademoiselle eugénie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me and do you say this wedding is at hand oh yes in spite of all i could say				981.1929720780647
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects				7202.675768531436
on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the baron s equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle				2775.597427266643
on their side the mother and daughter retired into the embrasure of a window to read eagerly the following letter dear wife we have now reached the moment of decision				8249.0770298488
but to her great surprise d artagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better when will you do that immediately i hope ah				344.0683534969024
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son 60 000 francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500 000 or 600 000 livres				2247.9831069627544
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper				10771.84276228627
i who have a seraglio at cairo one at smyrna and one at constantinople preside at a wedding never then you refuse me decidedly and were you my son or my brother i would refuse you in the same way but what must be done said andrea disappointed				33100.4100364532
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself				504.01820123532644
gaspard caderousse he had married a woman from the village of carconte and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her village				3061.992529515987
yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain				7045.656098638832
for i have no friend but yourself upon earth who am neglected and forgotten by my father harassed and persecuted by my stepmother and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man whose withered hand can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the eye alone although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild				6140.591040404604
athos had not failed to send early to aramis and had given his letter to blaisois the only serving man whom he had left				1011.4718199641376
there was something mournful solemn and terrible in the count s manner				605.2442036845658
he had written to the duc de beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive and he would find paris tranquil				30406.03168430197
the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the catacombs of saint sebastian i know it said château renaud i narrowly escaped catching a fever there and i did more than that replied morcerf for i caught one				481.478818606546
bonacieux and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom				2845.3330962502414
why count exclaimed eugénie what has happened to your ward				16619.869645683775
did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death prurigo and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane insane raving mad his head becomes weaker				5302.266170014868
let one of us put on the dress and mount the king s horse				1046.4111771153268
holloa there cried he what do you want you strumpet				19289.70352559594
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m				689.9322726505543
my son said anne of austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered here is monsieur d artagnan who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women				2108.3506768508973
since you say i am sold to cross the tyne reach scotland and rejoin lord montrose who will not sell you and what shall i do in scotland				27138.166265551874
before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward				6893.630560209293
a greek murmured the count of morcerf				882.9157899012392
if i find you alive on my return you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie madame de villefort sighed her nerves gave way and she sunk on the carpet				9393.925776248632
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian				616.75734828166
help cried caderousse i am murdered we are here take courage ah it s all over				1717.4509719349749
never mind renée replied the marquise with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features but however all other feelings may be withered in a woman s nature there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart and that is the shrine of maternal love				835.2457414295536
he followed a short distance close under the wall then crossed a path hid entered a clump of trees				2823.12053678094
he then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety				1489.9567061230703
there always comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before god and see perhaps it is a happiness for you humble and powerless as i am that you have met with me for if i leave this place well i have powerful friends who after having exerted themselves on my account may also exert themselves for you oh when i said i was alone said milady hoping to make the novice talk by talking of herself it is not for want of friends in high places but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal				417.04596739295863
some day the people will burn that house as they burned that of the marechal d ancre				29885.311230881973
maximilian villefort rose half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief				2070.040651505624
signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied				3004.764869463572
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger				1897.5436729548976
pray don t heed him sir he only barks he never bites				14153.676902313038
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also				1624.7307693954258
there were benches here and there the four gentlemen stopped near them at a sign from athos porthos and d artagnan sat down the two others stood in front of them				281.63009285946214
she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson french had come to her father s related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter				791.7501179167905
ah dear constance i have found you then i see you at last and milady stretched out her arms to mme				108.87877832929271
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the time place and circumstances of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past yes well that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary man extraordinary did you say yes you have known him for some time then scarcely longer than eight or ten days and do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight or ten days				1249.7218299996412
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life				353.1156204025194
still a last ray of twilight lighted the plain				3470.668377537785
madame de bois tracy asked me for one of her friends who resides in the provinces i believe for a trustworthy maid				3355.9821738891096
paris is not paved with cambric monsieur you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me said d artagnan in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more loudly than his pacific resolutions				4947.423992024617
then going around the house i placed grimaud at the other exit and here i am				3140.6529786541814
yes since she lives at that moment d avrigny s glance met noirtier s eye				1305.6946171306452
ah exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says himself alas yes murmured de winter				299.66447186429974
a family affair athos had invented the phrase family affair				1111.6464553293642
my good nanette be quiet i beseech you said broussel				18667.305861339424
the poor devil would eat nothing from fear it is incredible no my dear fellow it is not at all incredible				11098.927994250324
the interior of the musketeers chapter viii				23185.290953212316
carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened				1607.8968882428956
a cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my forehead				1615.7918009656744
you foolish fellow said athos laughing				832.0421927772715
i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly everything appears to me black in this house said debray				227.1122986734314
why is he not here that i may tell him so sir replied monte cristo coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little family affairs				1596.5294576509912
he came hoping that i would accept my shame as my shame was consummated he came to offer his fortune in exchange for my love				876.6257229298691
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurator s wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears i madame said porthos drawing himself up proudly how so the signs just now and the holy water				1331.0872056495118
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it				68.13268163332776
m de villefort heard of him at marseilles and m danglars recollects having seen him				12.171969577536363
but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured				15728.60987532662

the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years				2540.1688837640922
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it				22.46603823060699
he will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to take				4996.194534169438
during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake				14066.640562260785

it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled				4055.2819575490917
the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his side not from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation he fought like a furious tiger turning ten times round his adversary and changing his ground and his guard twenty times				3496.3983611404437
motionless with her burning and fixed glances in her solitary apartment how well the outbursts of passion which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her respiration accompany the sound of the surf which rises growls roars and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle				5837.517889131076
albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother he threw his arms around her neck				2499.7392554854655
then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand come i had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson i only wanted a murder and here it is				1264.5864118431912
he was in a most elegant hunting costume and monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him				191.01505323722657

there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women				1844.3262756644415
having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the allées de meilhan belonged dantès next proceeded thither and under the name of lord wilmore the name and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty five thousand francs at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked half a million it would unhesitatingly have been given				2295.838590331134
dame nanette look for those apricots which madame de longueville sent to us yesterday from noisy and give half a dozen of them to your son with a crust of new bread oh thank you sir thank you monsieur broussel said friquet i am so fond of apricots broussel then proceeded to his wife s room and asked for breakfast it was nine o clock				855.174532889505
leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of montlhéry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name				941.802849399396
before god and before men i accuse this woman of having urged me to the murder of the baron de wardes but as no one else can attest the truth of this accusation i attest it myself				683.1095193419964
on the exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father the servants all fled with muttered imprecations they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the court afterwards all was still they had one and all deserted the accursed house				694.2144205803189
who made the lemonade i did did you bring it to your master directly it was made no you left it somewhere then in the meantime yes i left it in the pantry because i was called away who brought it into this room then mademoiselle valentine d avrigny struck his forehead with his hand				414.0087100953633
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count s pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting				2676.0446031653373
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating				10034.27772771502
you say you fear nothing but death i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans and old age my end will be achieved before i grow old and madness i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom non bis in idem				11005.898947836897
zounds he said i don t suppose there is a more contented man at this moment in all the kingdom than yourself you are right my lord duke answered the officer i don t know any pleasanter sight on earth than a well covered table and when added to that he who does the honors is the grandson of henry iv you will my lord duke easily comprehend that the honor fairly doubles the pleasure one enjoys the duke in his turn bowed and an imperceptible smile appeared on the face of grimaud who kept behind la ramee				967.0142374737039
we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to speak				603.5472929082853
the peasant the gardener was rochefort whom he believed to be in the bastile				3257.137344437969
how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven and very soon they left the inn				4064.4426002458863
no sound was audible save that of the carriages that were carrying the maskers home nothing was visible save a few lights that burnt behind the windows				1420.0923887779777
the pavilion at nine o clock d artagnan was at the hôtel des gardes he found planchet all ready				861.5579606462485
but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders				734.4830145190408
our friends are become our most dangerous enemies athos				171.4533042717869
yes said château renaud these italians are well named and badly dressed you are fastidious château renaud replied debray those clothes are well cut and quite new that is just what i find fault with				1742.75671477626
but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a house and a mute to furnish it he will do everything wrong undeceive yourself monsieur replied monte cristo i am quite sure that on the contrary he will choose everything as i wish				1413.8411702772753
come come said maximilian i will serve as your guide such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant				1488.530771713316
he rushed toward d artagnan with eyes fixed upon him and clasped him in his arms				570.2631643746219
i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount willingly then it is settled yes but where i have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his nature				2548.782095516306
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate				2437.8609782615345
athos when he reached his appointed room observed through the gratings of his window walls and roofs and was told on inquiry by comminges that he was looking on the back of the pavilion where d artagnan was confined				18751.398027541913
or having delivered you make you sign a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth right rail on rail on at your ease gentlemen said morcerf somewhat piqued				3535.5925111694078
come gentlemen your swords said the duke				496.95142209339656
there was only one person among the crew who had any feeling of ill will towards me				27.345742466133746
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp				10279.426816176963
will you go up with me i follow you monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories				5449.333552262201
i may continue to rely upon it may i not oh sire cried the four companions with one voice we would allow ourselves to be cut to pieces in your majesty s service well well but keep whole that will be better and you will be more useful to me				34.92637262943182
the duke glanced at the clock				1313.8110977974259
on arriving in paris d artagnan found a letter from m de tréville which informed him that at his request the king had promised that he should enter the company of the musketeers				987.7556341030058
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue				4732.187955165301
you were writing i your fingers are stained with ink ah true i was writing				13443.36352073867
from whom is this said he eagerly				2046.638191185826
porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the rue du vieux colombier				10166.074323793327
he proposed the conditions the two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pistoles				2544.608344871324
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt				11715.6737535484
these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect				7719.167434971686
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine				10847.458132765283
franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him				16.140948596430963
when you come to paris i will return all this i will not refuse i intend going there soon and since you allow me i will pay you a visit				1728.2201378090583
salite said the count in the same tone in which he would have given an order to his servant				1137.0553638856106
let me see continued the stranger i am one of your largest creditors your bills at least are the first that will fall due do you wish for time to pay a delay would save my honor and consequently my life how long a delay do you wish for morrel reflected				2277.8169082540876
are you going to leave us count said madame de villefort				181.0700567622653
it seemed as if his feet were rooted to the ground and his eyes on the count of morcerf				1051.3130052350891
i should have thought that his duchess oh porthos s duchess is dressed by her husband s clerks said d artagnan laughing				774.9338507301884
the three men brought the carriage up quietly and took out of it a little man stout short elderly and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark color who ascended the ladder very carefully looked suspiciously in at the window of the pavilion came down as quietly as he had gone up and whispered it is she immediately he who had spoken to me approached the door of the pavilion opened it with a key he had in his hand closed the door and disappeared while at the same time the other two men ascended the ladder				1691.0638351797604
it was four o clock when dantès was placed in this chamber				1003.4593203111176
then is it not resumed the duke the superintendent emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building the dog again shook his head as if to say no then said the prisoner let s think who it can be				1555.9359408791129
come come where either to seek the duc de beaufort or the duc de bouillon and to tell them about this yes but on one condition that we begin by the coadjutor				3781.7917567742816
ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three musketeers to halt				33456.33405603923
i faith no said d artagnan i was not in voice monsieur du vallon has a cold and did not cry either				9937.294346800987
you remarked that we were all active vigorous and armed yes you are mistaken				1404.2252696762564
you will find me ready to follow you they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin d artagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens				17733.871522770092
do you know what consoled him				12.351063941600765
cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed seized his rapier and returned toward d artagnan but on his way he met athos who during his relief which d artagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that d artagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight				5535.316990926036
let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by it ah said dantès you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you i assure you replied the old man i did not turn to that source for recreation or support what did you do then i wrote or studied were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper oh no answered the abbé i had none but what i made for myself you made paper pens and ink yes dantès gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing				11744.804237792343
why did you talk of a regiment athos				505.54229968776446
i did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark true said porthos				15.844518137944196
my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself				696.901922894788
in the meantime d artagnan was defiling with his company				1212.9937633540767
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender				20754.876270189678
then in that chamber which recalled to him so many royal souvenirs whither had come so many courtiers the scene of so much flattering homage alone with a despairing servant whose feeble soul could afford no support to his own the king at last yielded to sorrow and his courage sank to a level with that feebleness those shadows and that wintry cold				2073.247169102026
yes said porthos recollecting himself but one uniform and one sword will not suffice for two well but there s his comrade true said porthos				16.779257672380968
satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions athos returned to the hôtel and found planchet impatiently waiting for him				26.48871031810634
all paris rung with the praises of madame danglars beautiful horses and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them is it possible exclaimed the count with well feigned astonishment that these horses belong to the baroness they do indeed				633.7777261025464
give me my felt hat bernouin the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim				4684.323447950215
cardinal i must have the queen s papers but how to take them sire				2620.0677815054896
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified				5653.477336034551
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his eminence i understand				1222.8449584422324
it is true that the indulgence of his foster mother encouraged him				11.155489997193841
the window let at an exorbitant price which the count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests was on the second floor of the great palace situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio				574560.7542089964
if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years old				1997.8060416296623
this can t last and he drew another twenty from his pocket				782.9111222570236
dividing the proceeds the apartment on the first floor of the house in the rue saint germain des prés where albert de morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious person				1449.5347155639824
all has gone according to my wishes				5792.4269241256825
but morrel disappointed in his expectations of exciting fear was conscious only of the other s condescension				10315.349637157022
all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you				25.02731534254419
you will not sign that order my lord said felton making a step toward the duke				635.3275312422876
m de tréville was not at his hôtel				1789.304970157895
the count perceived at one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawing room m danglars at the other and eugénie in front of him				165.2340946759458
the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least				1989.3067241645226
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered edmond				1516.8938075461874
let us go to breakfast i shall be happy to do so the morning air has made me hungry yes said porthos my air is excellent they went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt				9322.644094806008
d artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three his paleness terrified athos who however consented himself with saying that s a sad throw comrade you will have the horses fully equipped monsieur the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice				2643.097647397374
yes if i am killed said albert laughing				1011.4665145972209
m de tréville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m de tréville hastened to report himself at the louvre				5985.093297473696
shall i give you the change my officer said the host				682.3112912102089
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him no sire where did he lodge rue de la harpe				13724.678424325959
34 oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge				30209.198898999224
it is a mercy to let me die for if i live i shall lose my reason and become mad				2969.2881933588224
tis well order four men to conduct them to my lodging four men prepared to do so				201.26926350179326
it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam				16086.224062054001
no sir the facts were precisely what you have stated said madame de villefort and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m de villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two children of these inveterate enemies it was a sublime and charitable thought said monte cristo and the whole world should applaud it				20.653006042914992
you are saying to yourself fifteen days twenty days				1252.7694677553727
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised d artagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter				522.750228293167
that instant the arm of porthos fell				4554.665084412271
d artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position like that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him				15.648525594829103
yes my lord and how much will that cost me monsieur d artagnan zounds my lord i don t know yet				3345.204184455646
let us hope my child cried the marquis that m de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province if so he will have achieved a noble work and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father s conduct added the incorrigible marquise				1468.3903685244286
what is his name you know him indeed yes it is surely not one of my friends replied d artagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant				4707.458560579103
i as a tender father and i as a dutiful son as they choose that i shall be descended from you whom do you mean by they ma foi i can hardly tell but i was alluding to those who wrote the letter you received one did you not yes from whom from a certain abbé busoni have you any knowledge of him no i have never seen him what did he say in the letter you will promise not to betray me rest assured of that you well know that our interests are the same then read for yourself and the major gave a letter into the young man s hand				270.34541356986335
it was the soul of my husband well if my husband s soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter				8759.400685770332
i said aramis in his most flutelike tone i had made up my mind				664.2072897113663
you will be well fed there if the hostess remains the same				1313.1929134904988
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert				9551.27244212131
if he comes to france will you accord him hospitality				13032.89890077707
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglars hair to stand on end				1208.0723315518997
at this cry all the crowd re entered the apartment and throughout the palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult				7683.260484173612
unfortunately edmond s brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his thoughts to anything in particular				5413.4326930381785
porthos who could never see anything that was not self evident talked to him as usual				2186.7177114434985
my dear bazin said d artagnan i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause so far well said aramis we are dying of hunger				2267.160735442393
first you purchase a house at auteuil this house is the one where i have committed an assassination you descend to the garden by the same staircase by which he descended you stop at the spot where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his child				1285.579198541077
it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for maximilian had long awaited her coming				4607.510297569127
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence strict liability breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1 f 3				5132.339315398142
if you require to know positively what she is capable of read her past history on her left shoulder well now that will do wonderfully well said athos				15.287697149649636
when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughter s hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure				10890.111208479419
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman				1802.9096244731509
did you ever occupy yourself said he to franz with the employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants				4033.6359828541185
they stopped at the sign of the fox in the rue du vieux colombier a tavern known for many years by athos and asked for two bedrooms				13806.78083550059
who said valentine was dead the two men turned round and saw morrel standing at the door pale and terror stricken				6520.990763394429
by its light between the island of lemaire and cape croiselle a quarter of a league distant dantès saw a fishing boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves				1414.4197282017956
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms				54272.010684206776
if you die i will die with you that is all i can say to you silence cried felton we are here in fact they touched the sloop				6951.866879117618
we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us				145.9451098111985
a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict				27516.886796541028
the orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience and very prudently have no hell that is the point 30075m really madame this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours but which would easily yield before sound reasoning				29064.068167090292
you leaned upon my arm upon this madame				867.6505418006622

one light alone was visible and dantès saw that it came from mercédès chamber				815.283604450474
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as much but it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness what you say is perhaps true they know my habits				7761.583135018573
if richelieu made the king by comparison seem small he made royalty great				3735.451913430186

he was still young he was only four or five and twenty he had nearly fifty years to live				2652.5354027772437
franz resolved to wait for albert as late as possible				1492.085362614672
the usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word				1036.3606479860862
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began				1878.0774911475096
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other				686.2109928213798
i was waiting for you sir said mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe				5201.853715046127
d artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him				37.36879580921705
gentlemen continued the stranger since you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice i must name myself				467.0305763994206
he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear				12830.756876837771
at that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet				28264.04495053505
madame de villefort merely cried be still edward she then added this young madcap is however very nearly right and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times for mademoiselle de villefort is in spite of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the effect of her beauty				2434.299471685275
signor pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem				22283.769020506246

here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival				2079.1823130002535
and that very evening the prisoners sketched a plan of education to be entered upon the following day				405.79144600781024
i spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and i fainted again and now how are you feeling very ill replied the wounded man				89.95723001556014
have you a name then i bear that of your brother ay but you are mistaken				1424.1393924799397
happily for him he has ceased to bear that name and therefore said d artagnan resolved to be patient to the end it is not aramis i seek but the abbé d herblay				6104.535742855152
he gave porthos a second nudge of the knee and porthos got up as if to stretch his legs and took care at the same time to ascertain that his sword could be drawn smoothly from the scabbard				1849.380312969102
if you will permit me i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of works by the ancient masters warranted as such				20546.985392597126
madame de villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young edward by way of amusing himself was tearing to pieces before his mother could finish reading them				94.99157325807221
it was about half past nine				4071.883868125037
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinière				6542.624815398868
at any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for i have made a rare acquisition 0279m under pretence of being fatigued dantès asked to take the helm the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade				8452.755587471935

she asked d artagnan if he had a mistress				1543.5640305626837
her eyes raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a shadow mounting towards heaven				744.5653297784103
from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anything d artagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart				353.13767869446764
well what shall you do with this money count				212.1961416807157

and your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them				46.64680325193462
imagine to yourself a don quixote of eighteen a don quixote without his corselet without his coat of mail without his cuisses a don quixote clothed in a woolen doublet the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade between lees of wine and a heavenly azure face long and brown high cheek bones a sign of sagacity the maxillary muscles enormously developed an infallible sign by which a gascon may always be detected even without his cap and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort of feather the eye open and intelligent the nose hooked but finely chiseled				13237.808952118305
you see it makes a very respectable appearance pardieu cried d artagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinal s money you are an amiable and charming young man said mme				62.63882968680453
everyone had arrived almost before the usual hour and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract the attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious colleagues				10830.061559788968
she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass plot where she fainted				4015.1983433935147
the fair woman on whose account i gave you advice which naturally you took care not to adopt i gave you my reasons yes you look there for your outfit i think you said not at all				272.2020154882831
oh come gentlemen my master is ill the three friends hastened toward d artagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse				1058.2038714973387
there was no time to lose				2391.8658369563177
so you are here cried the officer in the tone of ill humor habitual to him what the devil are you doing here i wish to know can you tell me pray is anything fresh occurring in this part of the town what do you mean				2390.917103780444
the major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit				8155.274179321105
no boat exclaimed groslow it is impossible tis true however answered the sailor there s nothing in the wake of the ship besides here s the end of the cable what s the matter cried mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his torch				9124.863337252804

d artagnan took possession of his command				3393.4113358424597
then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel or if she be a woman of any consideration they lock her up for life				343.20661882403317

he knew the abbé de gondy only by report				3813.619724131762
you have conspired with your wife with madame de chevreuse and with my lord duke of buckingham indeed monseigneur responded the mercer i have heard her pronounce all those names and on what occasion she said that the cardinal de richelieu had drawn the duke of buckingham to paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen she said that cried the cardinal with violence				11543.172446734186
but it seems you have come back rich my boy continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantès had thrown on the table				874.639096677349
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future				1737.1754589444258
not a sound was heard in the castle except of a footstep up and down in the chamber above as he supposed the bedroom of athos				405.06204027600245
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are				1691.1743103922815
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away				1431.6664722354385
these studs can not be trusted to anybody it must be done in the palace impossible my lord				573.160493855487
horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen garden and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation				36074.978849998835
a slight oscillation showed dantès that all went well				488.2554899260462
she was branded athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand				394.1912527242286
all at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars				6156.745875014952
men may subdue men they can not overcome the elements				17329.180518629026
a nice acquaintance my friend porthos replied aramis i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is injurious to you among the women gentlemen gentlemen cried d artagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is serious				5385.990712932093
embrace also our good and brave porthos				373.5936312411061
no said athos monsieur aramis does me the honor to share my opinions could you put me in communication with your witty and agreeable friend				733.7318079460146
there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in point cedant arma togæ said villefort with a bow				3744.3721209504165
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter				1539.8038313031666
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him				169.76678463480593
he said very good muttered the major then sir replied he				25.480795547421348

monsieur d artagnan is in monsieur dessessart s guards and this gentleman is in the company of monsieur de tréville s musketeers				1005.1291912900255
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered				12232.829825088897
this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau				5962.90254054288
but by degrees watch chains necklaces parti colored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded				8642.501997786028
and aramis said the duchess quickly				1511.8376271156258
yes surely he came with the prince a charming young man he is one of your friends then monsieur le comte yes sir answered athos agitated so much so that i wish to see him if possible quite possible sir do me the favor to accompany me and i will conduct you to headquarters halloo there cried aramis turning around what a noise behind us a body of cavaliers is coming toward us said chatillon				4085.0070591208205

it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteur s carriage said d artagnan upon my honor i begin to think that heaven favors us he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman s little finger				1680.7177342280804
no my daughter is not guilty				1496.9876813386309
it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in the community				18306.1252751549
bonaparte m dandré looked at louis xviii who employed in writing a note did not even raise his head				366.60446820447333
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio				1706.7668172380443
my left side still pains me are you sure we are on the right track lieutenant egad didn t you hear				8627.11940070163
nothing then preventing my escape by this means i examined the grounds				41800.880534758544
villefort s only answer was a stifled groan				3413.2618259537016
thanks to what aramis had told him d artagnan who knew already that porthos called himself du vallon was now aware that he styled himself from his estate de bracieux and that he was on account of this estate engaged in a lawsuit with the bishop of noyon				25538.674231646186
m coquenard poured from a very small stone bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men served himself in about the same proportion and passed the bottle to porthos and mme				480.21110398639956
sign it then caderousse signed it				21.370148738247966
nevertheless he pressed d artagnan s hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered				14272.9318904814
villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study				2428.9426426425057
the enemy s army extended from cassel to courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them				111.93431176229022
we shall meet soon i trust in paris where you shall have your revenge the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness				1360.1167659584294
i see you know him exclaimed the wife for you have become pale in your turn truly cried the host misfortune is coming on our house it is the former executioner of bethune the former executioner of bethune murmured the young monk shrinking back and showing on his countenance the feeling of repugnance which his penitent inspired				14388.11380993637
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer				4706.39918557018
d artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme				102.5724581901247
of what consequence to me is imprisonment or death it is i who no longer understand you madame said felton				262.9640137165452

truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate				15631.024049213187
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served				4162.54661010215
for the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones				6479.141821628002
vasiliki said he to my mother trembling perceptibly the instant approaches which will decide everything				496.98507224897486
in the meantime as we have said mazarin was in his closet putting his affairs in order				1969.2850827883965
d artagnan i am ready to follow you and i also said porthos				17.857722309697845
porthos was discontented with his condition				1697.4857703962382
is it my equipment yes and no replied mousqueton				446.20376446719547
these three windows were in madame de saint méran s room				323.94642152168007

truly she might have thought of you at home i have no fear of that or if she did it was only in the same way in which i think of her touching sympathy				4127.038982634584
for one second d artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d artagnan recognized the coadjutor				3688.392252322423
my mother in law expended gold caresses dignities on concini who ruined her the king made vitry marechal of france for an assassination while i have left in obscurity in poverty the noble d artagnan who saved me and running to a table on which were paper pens and ink she hastily began to write				2519.902426347554
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count				395.53146098756974
he went to desire you to come to the palace				1733.9090370395004
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair				6323.574478892012
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of gold and cases of diamonds even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them				104.15227347036564
it is a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the cavalcanti were				3096.621210639797
noirtier wishes to see you tonight he said in an undertone				5040.424917321168
if i bore my proper title i should be a lord				893.5205676110265
before he could be possibly set free the cardinal would be dead and indeed so convinced is he of this that he entreated me should i find your majesty disposed to act in this way to do all i could to induce you to change your resolution well then i will content myself with arresting you madame the possibility of my arrest has been foreseen and should i not have returned by to morrow at a certain hour the next day the cardinal will be brought to paris and delivered to the parliament it is evident sir that your position has kept you out of relation to men and affairs otherwise you would know that since we left paris monsieur le cardinal has returned thither five or six times that he has there met de beaufort de bouillon the coadjutor and d elbeuf and that not one of them had any desire to arrest him your pardon madame i know all that				693.6029517077644
ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested				13418.2458370429
in our position one must provide for everything i shall try to gain the coast of france				615.4241979723262
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well this is a council of state d artagnan remarked to porthos but we held better ones at la rochelle with athos and aramis at the saint gervais bastion said porthos				561.1346098849027
what you ask is impossible monsieur continued he addressing faria				3218.0241337907755
who is this wretch who takes my comb and puts it in his pocket asked the duke				543.4798907293924
la ramee s mouth watered and he returned to the duke s chamber rubbing his hands				331.377569633434
you come to demand money of me of a musketeer				1473.1726877860874
i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me athos was more delighted than can be told				4827.363141155582
i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and forty eight hours to stay there that makes three weeks				15998.041022258903
the table at which the puritan officers were seated was round and whether by chance or coarse intention harrison sat with his back to the king				816.7750745907678
the marquis de saint méran i think the concierge said				365.5198026936293
defend yourself one minute said the young man				118.27626637629496
now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not				370.2155443002967
sign the treaty then monseigneur said aramis				17.797362191392246
then i launched out into the path that was opened to me				86.33551006920197
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror				537.9073578134934
i thought as much said d artagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts				2829.420895613578
restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered julie to monte cristo				8.807661664519314
i am acquainted with monsieur de putange i met monsieur dujart in england i know monsieur de tréville monsieur de tréville exclaimed the novice do you know monsieur de tréville yes perfectly well intimately even the captain of the king s musketeers the captain of the king s musketeers why then only see cried the novice we shall soon be well acquainted almost friends				562.4239023982849
i am luigi vampa shepherd of the san felice farm what do you want i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca bianca follow me then said the sentinel or as you know your way go first vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit went before teresa and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as before				756.7461372351152
dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings				24440.205772911995
but in what force was the enemy				1392.909560352755
well i sold my shares the news got out and i no longer sold i gave them away next day i find the news was false and by this false report i have lost 700 000 francs well well since i gave you a fourth of my gains i think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of 700 000 francs is 175 000 francs what you say is absurd and i can not see why m debray s name is mixed up in this affair because if you do not possess the 175 000 francs i reclaim you must have lent them to your friends and m debray is one of your friends 30245m for shame exclaimed the baroness				1933.908594183178
d artagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it				21.118646168309763
no quarter cried a voice in french answering to that of winter which made them tremble				3980.7312395655595
really madame he said did i alarm you much oh no sir she answered but you know things impress us differently according to the mood of our minds villefort forced a laugh				1030.7732989325775
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair				1567.004628341701
only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas what are they sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment				3937.8866197962875
then turning to noirtier do you hope the assassin will be tried no then you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine yes it is no news to you added d avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to poison her the old man made a sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject				1050.5062137444493
he weighed the two angers in his brain that of the cardinal and that of the queen that of the cardinal predominated enormously				22677.533097960804
but d artagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts				16959.777280635717
these three musketeers shall follow us said he in an undertone				5236.171649830785
good said monte cristo to morrel who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which danglars had been the victim i have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand francs for which i would have paid a hundred thousand what have you discovered asked morrel				220.16236803695566
we were speaking of hanging ah you see how it is said athos becoming still paler but yet attempting to laugh i was sure it was so the hanging of people is my nightmare yes yes replied d artagnan				1.4048321209399923
let him come yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come moreover he is but a child said aramis				16.499198843669483
but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove everyone listened eagerly monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips was about to speak				600.0767317348559
holloa patrick sign my lord never never help shouted the duke and at the same time he sprang toward his sword				888.3686020533546
a garrison life is fatal even to the most aristocratic organization and imperceptibly d artagnan always in the camp always on horseback always in garrison became i know not how in the present age one would express it a typical trooper				22616.79949976073
d artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeer s uniform in every street of the camp				1631.2235667629998
the striking points of his face were effaced he had still a nose but his cheeks fattened out each took a portion of it unto themselves his chin had joined his throat his eyes were swelled up with the puffiness of his cheeks his hair cut straight in holy guise covered his forehead as far as his eyebrows				31633.466369473797
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life				540.0337829437458
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine but there is one thing i wish to know and what is that inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated				2930.0373312258102
and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion				2661.953545811549
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect no not perfect was the count s reply only impenetrable that s all				305.34701938519083
mazarin started turned toward the comte de la fere and looking for an instant at that grand and honest countenance took the pen				9483.408165300172
the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head				647.0185184245285
really my lord you are his nightmare the duke smiled with bitterness				13019.19676622933
i accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent putting the letter in her bosom she took her son s arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs				2246.299748285029
for you and your comrades this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm				6152.0973786763625
danglars turned to the left another man on horseback was galloping on that side				994.6756519586223
devil take the vain fellow said d artagnan				1.4529678985877403
how do you know the motives that person may have for trying to extract all he can from you i pledge you my word madam said the abbé that my intentions are good and that your husband can incur no risk provided he answers me candidly ah that s all very fine retorted the woman				530.4569798018141
he has received visits from the coadjutor from madame de longueville and the prince de conti madame de chevreuse and madame de vendome have left their names at his door				212.69616921290591
ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is then he ran to one of the cupboards in valentine s room which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver case a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a blood red color				4384.621288115722
the duchess loudly lamented the announcement of peace				10972.498841486367
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the street was quiet				14421.275848701305
good so much the better said caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice				23352.03134370107
the noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant				7838.154796289309
i take them said d artagnan for myself				322.04448055618957
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped				14481.751340332186
d artagnan s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract				32416.509062057274
do you know his house at auteuil certainly what do you know respecting it do you wish to know why he bought it yes the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments				42901.21990244781
the door had remained open so strong was the excitement produced by the arrival of athos whose wound though kept as a secret was known to all				380.5791835691258
noble and unhappy king are you wounded cried aramis				58.406804798266386
no no she answered i would rather remain here are you really frightened madame said monte cristo				6.223093295206308
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession				1742.0480063979019
you will find here moreover the young woman of whom i spoke who is persecuted no doubt in consequence of some court intrigue				13530.775212950224
grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and double locked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure				6634.529988688545
as fast as they entered they were placed in the grand saloon on the platforms prepared for them				239.14711694838644
well this waistcoat was discovered today covered with blood and with a hole over the heart the ladies screamed and two or three prepared to faint				3327.119945692929
never replied the count who was by this time perfectly master of himself again				404.86102244539677
however the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness				105369.99852452993
he was shown in directly he came to say that if these offensive precautions were not discontinued in two hours paris would be under arms				472.01422590276087
mazarin pretended not to understand the double meaning of his own sentence but continued to compassionate the fate of concino concini				48473.779654466256
the arts change about and make a tour of the world things take a different name and the vulgar do not follow them that is all but there is always the same result				8369.732830168516
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horses one for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern				6154.550314213465
yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post do you say the procurator s wife is old and ugly fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to pathaud s account in that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be softened				16226.24916203183
you are a man of taste				4647.7190492762375
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces				23755.313801263066
he drew back a step and hung down his head without however ceasing to look at her as if fascinated by this strange creature he could not detach his eyes from her eyes				609.6562066529445
bonacieux who had sent for m laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time				721.7830750701131
14 be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the count bowing				2405.54555228105
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together				1409.8597335291684
his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercédès exercised over him				85.8027999624881
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer				1056.4720203810118
the count of san felice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited				5652.000237170266
so my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said morcerf				638.7083032499235
and then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind i besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life				422.4898683650331
possibly this one who asks nothing or seems to ask nothing has asked more in the eyes of heaven than those who tax the country and steal the bread of the poor				10179.15175498437
d artagnan thought of all these matters				2871.0808153709486
be pleased to give me that scrap of paper so that i may justify by a pretext at least my abandoning my countrymen				44295.228449804854
friend he said you have been too good in pardoning me i was wrong a hundred times wrong				1429.7883098790867
in his youth d artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities besides he had the cardinal s hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word				1215.3385487600722
the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty five or twenty six years of age				1693.76246091979
he did so and thus doubled his income				27228.58940556488
and m bonacieux whom d artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him				21.220104232799176
the king threw himself into an arm chair				1693.2052748606475
m danglars dined with me i know it to avoid meeting him my mother and i left town but he met here m andrea cavalcanti your italian prince not so fast m andrea only calls himself count calls himself do you say yes calls himself is he not a count what can i know of him				36.711403366541916
the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before him you have no idea then morrel asked château renaud you do not propose anything oh yes returned the young man smiling on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay you have a sister asked the count				229.83983529396795
i wished to run to the window and call for help but my legs refused their office				2061.371631297168
i comprehend now you comprehend said porthos				17.44799178159715
the young girl looked at morrel				277.2480904664898
you see i am more candid than you ah my father said franz interrupting himself				137.06130069245975
certainly said andrea i shall not overtake my friend but i shall kill your horse therefore i had better stop				2265.0417549307203
if you make a single step to find her you are lost that s pretty positive continued d artagnan but after all it is but a menace yes but that menace terrifies me				29.532887833262382
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him				14.467724899963953
non inutile desiderium oblatione go to the devil with your latin				151932.0382968614
during the first act the countess g entered				755.8766406235828
is it by permission that he remains there asked gondy				1364.8900500600992
each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people				1024.6139730252728
now you have done grimaud take our brigadier s half pike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king grimaud obeyed without replying				12513964.367799358
here i have brought mine with me replied albert				111.54652587364617
d artagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself				473.5311807020083
he was engaged in an adventure so singular that he wished for counsel				7466.035620874653
with such a vade mecum d artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait				17562.95569079614
that will do i will be there endeavor not to make me wait for at quarter past twelve i will cut off your ears as you run good cried d artagnan i will be there ten minutes before twelve and he set off running as if the devil possessed him hoping that he might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carried him far				7433.602711119957
continue and say what we must do now monsieur laporte said d artagnan finish dressing his majesty we may go then asked the queen				237.02347782013703
well i swear to you all three that had the executioner of bethune was he not of bethune yes egad				13048.905025960048
ah said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of d artagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends				423.48382503644586
20121m that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights				14362.860856542049
i descended the staircase step by step the only thing i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees				748.5566579824775
monsieur baptistin especially i could never get such a man as that				737.3084774647353
woe to you m de villefort if you do not strike first this is what i would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three deaths has contemplated three murdered persons has knelt by three corpses				25258.8627482182
what with d artagnan grimaud and mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them				217.58847570686106
ma foi he said i prefer waiting till tomorrow				2037.2616923024368
you who have chateau meadows mountains woods you who have forty thousand francs a year you are not happy my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine				1681.466435314708
only to alleviate the tediousness of the duty athos allowed him to take a loaf two cutlets and a bottle of wine				1693.2714815767063
the result was that rospigliosi and spada paid for being cardinals and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators				13170.351653520449
listen replied felton in a low voice				810.8982051424848
she wept abundantly and let us speak it to the praise of m d artagnan the younger notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm as a future musketeer ought nature prevailed and he shed many tears of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half				6939.063248130495
de chavigny who according to report was a son of richelieu s and had been a creature of the late cardinal s understood tyranny				134897.968015412
you see my strength fails me you see plainly i can not walk				5509.983680289389
you were right my lord said felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of milady you were right my lord and i was wrong and both again left the room				347.997322601761
where are we going inquired aramis are we going to fight perchance				110923.20132730238
come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed				1620.1956316996175
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile				720.2129472893263

really sir he observed i see that in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior man you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with man and ending with man that is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace pray sir explain yourself said villefort more and more astonished i really do not understand you perfectly i say sir that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose sight of the sublime workman who makes them act i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a minister or king and that the men whom god has put above those office holders ministers and kings by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fill i say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation				9440.870048248302
well i went to a horse dealer s where i saw this magnificent horse which i have named médéah				38572.435634688234
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels				21360.676112941597
still as five o clock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner				736.1906106627808
yes i am a man of honor said d artagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess it for i do possess it do i not entirely go on well i feel as if transformed a confession weighs on my mind a confession if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not without doubt then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me perhaps d artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to milady s but she evaded him				13.421661686514211
it appears that in falling continued athos with some hesitation he broke his thigh ah ah said the cardinal and you monsieur porthos i monseigneur knowing that dueling is prohibited i seized a bench and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder is broken very well said the cardinal and you monsieur aramis monseigneur being of a very mild disposition and being likewise of which monseigneur perhaps is not aware about to enter into orders i endeavored to appease my comrades when one of these wretches gave me a wound with a sword treacherously across my left arm				895.5876601760872
you are not a priest you are a musketeer a musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe me				35.289762607771294

come on here you others he continued rising in his stirrups raising his sword and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught				17988.19604431442
he had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals				33266.07653825422
sir said d avrigny to villefort so loud that all might hear poor barrois has led too sedentary a life of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the carriage to the four corners of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him his blood has thickened				37966.350310435264
is that what you wish for yes replied the invalid				5237.1654710134135
the count did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided attention of the house but at the mention of yanina and colonel fernand he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him				14.74189408915549
oh continued she placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes never				14561.701400774979

all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed				4620.0636328459805
ah forgive me said valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian i have done wrong for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart				319.8852877515328
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach				15074.817943773978
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him				19.46214020207997
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me besides i may not be there myself where at your ball why should you not be there because you have not yet invited me but i come expressly for that purpose you are very kind but i may be prevented if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments tell me what it is my mother begs you to come the comtesse de morcerf said monte cristo starting				23368.27198804015
and his appearance had nothing extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took convinced franz that he expected the arrival of some person				1719.994857620674
besides you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed at what				965.1517723880942
and will you not torment me any more never caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be obliged to notice the change				4861.087642319896

a leather pocketbook a purse in which was evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received with a dice box and dice completed the possessions of the dead man				208.23234887010312
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to d elbeuf				22347094.68076542
i am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak i speak of the adventure eh you know well what i mean alas no my lord replied d artagnan surprised				1834.1284069672918
he saw me this morning for the first time and has already forgotten he has seen me				27.098000265841673
the dying man s eyes were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped succor would arrive				3927.4340461195748
perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so				212.99059639560636
be off you wretch cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face				567.4313462323403

bonacieux darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and double locked				18670.84890103107
one was a young man of three or four and twenty who was in love with m morrel s daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw the other was an old one eyed cashier called cocles or cock eye a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee hive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it				76.93147250546177

we shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection a dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she fears				5633.402483409139
the abbess assigned her a chamber and had breakfast served				4356.889832129962
how long a start have they two hours and a quarter my officer two hours and a quarter that is nothing we are well mounted are we not porthos porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor horses				1921.049602539383
you are gentlemen and i am a poor innkeeper				4590.943771416347
then he saw through the whole thing				2218.72519225248
athos who heard milady s voice came sharply up				795.7571961448375
the brand disappeared the beauty alone remained				9196.842745421764
but will that not excite suspicion sir asked the queen				235.87941760931827
wait said aramis that is an idea of which i invite you to take advantage my friend				640.3690916854325
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubted the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death				541.1401397687604
go d artagnan go grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon a half hour afterward d artagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any accident				6906.133012876067
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with rocks in which seats had been cut not unlike sentry boxes				53874.67825955047
he was in a subterranean passage by which he was to leave vincennes				9564.53495017655
at nine o clock then be ready here at the hôtel i will come and take you planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse				999.0702191449916
it was forty eight hours since i had taken any nourishment				27387.947258245367
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousin s with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required				8710.801016401669
see here it is the woman gazed at it a moment and then said in a gloomy voice suppose it s false caderousse started and turned pale				752.8195443028964

no pity for him who had no pity				1339.9581709621011
in a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds				3055.539980109428
dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement				7918.486862321272
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an auberge recommended by a sign representing st martin giving half his cloak to a poor man				420.338345232472
those who are known are not the most dangerous i know it and appeal to your penetration				21940.278882341798
none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity				7600.261103969425
whole days have i passed in these titanic efforts considering my labor well repaid if by night time i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the stones themselves then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish i dug up i was compelled to break through a staircase and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow part of it but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery				10849.041024403637
accordingly d artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him				22.155814041148663
well will you take me or shall i take edward madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue				2401.766688089996
the first object that met the eyes of d artagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions				22910.410539394634
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man				117.3787228863764
i mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain				1232.3165588380552
well asked the president what do you say to this letter general i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii				1591.1911396501175
i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight				2772.0738404522726
after having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his permission				15585.178143134399
two hours passed thus madame de saint méran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived				1751.193551858905
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening				777.38169583511
willingly my young cavalier said the priest if you will be content with the remains of my supper and with half my chamber the two travelers consulted for a moment				1342.8185675925351
will you come said he to porthos				86.74143075239634
bonacieux could not close his eyes not because his dungeon was so very disagreeable but because his uneasiness was so great				3656.8560502066975
we two are worth a dozen yes said porthos smiling at the remembrance of his former exploits but we four altogether would be equal to thirty six more especially as you say the work will not be child s play				4691.932998888258
the next day on awaking the count perceived raoul by his bedside				49713.01575460306
he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality				5010.432775241137
god forbid then let us be as we used to be let us be open with each other				678.4796903009658
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the cardinal				450.62124465931186
open it is i but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained closed				2712.0766024680256
look at this lady raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her king henry iv				1033.9114489407823
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house				720.7502632198796
as he was passing the allée des veuves he thought he saw the count s horses standing at gosset s shooting gallery he approached and soon recognized the coachman				2987.441068717105
morrel now emerged from his hiding place where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion				6388.408209539562
you to be sure said d artagnan pressing athos s hand				236.2089775545437
then morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen				1650.6211269683236
he had discovered those to whose death he had devoted his life				507.08551448030886
you must accomplish loyally the commission with which i deign to charge you and on that condition i pardon everything i forget everything and what is more and she held out her hand to him i restore my love bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious but he loved his wife				859.6489308820524
he must have written to him				17.914425621218776
i bear the traces of our friendship three slits or slashes from your sword well if you should be restored to favor don t forget me on the honor of a rochefort but you must do the like for me there s my hand i promise therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf i shall say it and you i shall do the same apropos are we to speak of your friends also athos porthos and aramis				362.4355206194731
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them they are mostly foreigners scotch irish or danish				23877.418927754145
that deposit may be at any moment withdrawn and if i had employed it for another purpose i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy				102075.13428739816
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you				39.39924232724235
arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to ali to stop then he passed into the dressing room which he examined				33591.60295242647
the crime was depicted in the most vivid colors the former life of the prisoner his transformation a review of his life from the earliest period were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur				1928.8240474747017
this time the devil himself shall not save them rejoined mordaunt				965.104370868625
in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study				2431.3065408130788
god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when he at length issued from his tomb enriched him with gold and diamonds and led him to you ah i recognize you i recognize you exclaimed the king s attorney you are i am edmond dantès you are edmond dantès cried villefort seizing the count by the wrist then come here and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo who ignorant of what had happened followed him in astonishment foreseeing some new catastrophe				4659.639764658049
well for my part i shall go to bed said d artagnan come porthos porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend				636.6968138932233
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day				733.1278301580801
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franz s curiosity				1459.7142264501288
morrel relaxed his hold of valentine and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain				1901.1854416703768
tell me the first time you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry other dainties which you now adore did you like them				142.98816705475755

but you d artagnan what is the matter with you and what has happened to you personally				5597.276395075734
nevertheless at eight o clock in the morning the regiment of the queen s guards commanded by guitant under whom was his nephew comminges marched publicly preceded by drums and trumpets filing off from the palais royal as far as notre dame a manoeuvre which the parisians witnessed tranquilly delighted as they were with military music and brilliant uniforms				31326.318177276044
that monsieur d artagnan is a very brave man mother said the young king				388.0563830518552
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant if the expression may be used				7126.573664532481
quite quite alone replied the man or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing you are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment				763.6129467558991
i have a jolly little circle of witty abbés and pretty women everything goes on smoothly so certainly dear friend i shall not meddle in politics well listen my dear aramis said d artagnan your philosophy convinces me on my honor				989.5465794076239
yes indeed that s the right thing				1773.6720913529882
if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards madame danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear				1398.107230084796
the abbé sank upon edmond s bed while edmond himself remained standing				48752.920294695905
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black				15083.532600566234
yes you have a recipe for it an infallible one that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink yes said monte cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed may we inquire what is this recipe asked debray				227.38666868704144
the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse				196.79145156574242
albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young cavalcanti monte cristo was for an instant alone				1148.280066868168
and i am very glad you recognize me dear m caderousse it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten years since we last met this calmness of busoni combined with his irony and boldness staggered caderousse				833.8569134092147

let me kill him we are all four lost if by the least gesture you discover that you recognize him then turning to the young man he exclaimed a fine prize				44075.22475765864
d artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal this was his second interview with richelieu and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last				2240.341530370613
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played but i can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault				7894.508968395857
50243m mon dieu cried danglars we are not returning to rome then it is not justice which is pursuing me				367.55474461278106
d artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour				1233.897667204366
but after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter yes where is this letter cried d artagnan				1.7591335074319876

take some more wine my dear cavalcanti said the count pouring out for him a second glass of alicante your emotion has quite overcome you his poor mother murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear				7958.505709310361
i do not love her but i will avenge myself for her contempt oh yes i know what sort of vengeance				1961.5392872123907
i am not your uncle i know you not my uncle replied mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in london you dare not				433.1179586654053

while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars				505.7904126858099

athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have described and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down near him				15.633825299124876
all the world has not the secret of the medicis or the borgias now replied the count shrugging his shoulders shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities				31312.578642862154
oh good lord cried porthos what precautions for the study of theology gentlemen gentlemen said d artagnan do not let us lose our time in jesting				63346.89844957876
d artagnan who foreseeing such an event had kept his eye on him sprang toward him caught him in his arms and assisted him to his chamber				784.068899615107
some fine morning he will return to take command of your vessel come when he will it shall be kept for him				16.140636886976417

upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given				1965.334801939026
and the guardsman d artagnan still my young scapegrace				429090.97902343527

well monsieur le comte said the duchess smiling does one leave so solemnly his old friends ah murmured athos kissing her hand had i only sooner known that marie michon was so charming a creature and he withdrew sighing				20887.07995071719
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness				38761.97749314083

the tiger whose nature teaches him to delight in shedding blood needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but man on the contrary loathes the idea of blood it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking life his natural construction and physiological formation dantès was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which had unconsciously been working in his mind or rather soul for there are two distinct sorts of ideas those that proceed from the head and those that emanate from the heart				485.733154633548
the count of monte cristo she murmured				3537.6735262885745
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said d artagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it there is no desert where a bird can not pass over one s head where a fish can not leap out of the water where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal				475.8029398257092
ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers well no madame this is the terrible news i have to tell you said villefort in a hollow voice no nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child disinterred no				374.06262045605405
stopped terrified at what he was about to say while richelieu stretching out his neck waited uselessly for the word which had died on the lips of the king				968.0116677115908
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over				1874.9135399551194
as the count s title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of one or the other chamber he said gentlemen pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous circumstance has occurred which is this thomson french the roman bankers have sent to me a certain person calling himself the count of monte cristo and have given him an unlimited credit with me				51.80578889815068
he converted his chamber into an observatory				18570.073316942526
oh you need not be alarmed you will only have lost him as you have lost your daughter i mean that i shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty roads leading out of france				580.2879448303354
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do				1332.7403863278118
you know bragelonne said athos i never speak without reflection well comte i am going instantly interrupted the duchess to send for the prince de marsillac who is happily in paris just now				1026.595588701777
you are examining the luxury i enjoy said the queen glancing sadly around her				78.93409336721663
besides maximilian morrel though hardly two and twenty had great influence over his father				733.2830612603935
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear d artagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it i pray d artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure				1702.1439114262173
however i scold you instead of him and in his place the storm will blow over more easily believe me				26.94088187130615
d artagnan departed scarcely knowing what to think but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head while continuing to pay his court to milady he had framed a little plan in his mind				650.2127976073238
but now you are happy doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain and your present happiness has it softened your heart my present happiness equals my past misery said the count				235.95051319848244
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends poor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind				27953.89339855438
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do				1306.7266791516001
very well done the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly twenty paces from him				49.680865535987785
the initials are only mine c				28310.715059624046
man s whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them				131.6863017280402
how can i if her husband fails in controlling her asked lucien you know the character of the baroness no one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases ah if i were in your place said albert				111.8421187190597
madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself				775.7168836186468
you know that i don t like it				69.63567952959976
yes your majesty cried the duke				481.6016633157121
he has slept a long time on a hard bed so he won t object to a soft one take every care of him i beg of you charles bowed and retired				1226.3199021528528
but athos was a man of inflexible determination he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty				2168.074767096066
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell				3021.3562923402324
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her				79.37471289122514
yes without the saddle you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom				9101.37172286962
the mission with which i am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed the abbé bowed				2093.435180298868
and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti				1536.247635348705
instead of returning then by the saint honore gate d artagnan who had time before him walked around and re entered by the porte richelieu				2319.71006081245
there was the crime bertuccio that was where you became really culpable true excellency that was the crime the real crime for in that i acted like a coward				2880.5496026017
you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day and yet i was not aware that you had married fernand my calumniator and that my father had died of hunger can it be cried mercédès shuddering				4219.23960340012
thanks to m morrel all the forms were got over in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust ah said villefort this seems to me the truth				1786.9371820801564
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward				3907.30881582233
i should like to have seen his face at that moment that would have been difficult no matter replied de boville in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs no matter i can fancy it and he shouted with laughter				1878.0676402648733
bonacieux help then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his				725.8204605939948
yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices				35239.70614913602
i say that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that thing but to pass to another				480.49237683661306
what again she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me a long silence followed the peach like the grapes fell to the ground				1294.8240108201667
how will the crown which is scarce firmly set on the head of louis xiv support a double weight the weight was not so heavy when i was in peril interrupted the queen with a sad smile and i ask no more for my husband than has been done for me you see that we are very humble monarchs sir oh you madame the cardinal hastened to say in order to cut short the explanation he foresaw was coming with regard to you that is another thing				2003.0905785602422
you have more experience than i have				3141.5846115907752
meanwhile valentine while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to me the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus				30064.661610580617
a sort of book written upon strips of cloth go and fetch it my good fellow and if it be what i hope you will do well i will run for it sir and the guide went out				258.113908512031
thanks to the garden we yet can flee i have the key but make haste				1182.867043447496
those bearing plumed hats and gold swords were stopped and made to cry long live broussel down with mazarin and whoever refused to comply with this ceremony was hooted at spat upon and even beaten				12841.44367006157
noble natures never lose courage nor good stomachs their appetites				30381.480759886043
ah said porthos to mordaunt i think we have you now my hero				7830.52648783711
the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on				651.9059871924331
spada knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cæsar wills that you die but it was a legate à latere who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him spada set out about two o clock to san pierdarena				33150.44996788915
adieu i entreat you doctor all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal				33731.117935669856
andrea cavalcanti the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room which baptistin had designated as the drawing room and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously				8261.051317269494
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me				45.40257965147713
beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i detest you				42.41808508042252
after the battle of navarino when the greek government was consolidated he asked of king otho a mining grant for that district which was given him				18.34775156011428
upon my word said albert you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful countess you are mistaken in thinking so returned franz calmly but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders i mean that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between ourselves and the countess nothing more is there indeed my good fellow				4224.087017481049
anticipating your wishes i have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages and ali he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the boy with a smiling air will have the honor of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash				18268.071348574817
monsieur du vallon and myself came from france with him it appears too you kept him waiting a long time at boulogne what would you have				2791.630208081548
on leaving monte cristo he walked slowly towards villefort s we say slowly for morrel had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps but he had hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts				957.4176313818464
ah then madame i was able for one instant to be alone with you				44.729039327051744
gimblou a glass of wine well how has all gone off zounds				4972.669383895511
tomorrow morning i start for paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time i shall be absent				11518.715650135679
it follows from this that the king s attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults faults or crimes responded monte cristo with a negligent air				1103.268029350271
i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall think for how do i know to the contrary that this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it i will come count i will be sure to come said villefort eagerly				2088.3952160000777
rob your master eat his sweetmeats and drink his wine but by jove				70917.29101975316
my sister would be bathed in tears and fainting i could not bear to see her suffer				13461.927721258693
this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is as dantès spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of renée who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him				31.55829864691876
i was drawn on by a very natural resentment to avenge my mother				880.492437034713
the cardinal s guards cried aramis and porthos at the same time				663.219862011924
come said he this matter will want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious thing you know				1116.1740039885517
but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger that is well understood and in that case how shall i know where you are you do not want your lackey is he a sure man to the proof give him to me				50.343955147202124
well now listen we are listening it appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him				11.512602957716105
you speak like the apocalypse and you are as true as the gospel				32913.52625656825
two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to them				72.27397980660979
madame bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is found no athos no you are mistaken said d artagnan i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies but i am ignorant				4463.159207919782
come i beseech you lend me twenty francs so that i may buy a dressing gown it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots				9653.073702275133
winter s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp				1583.9359751920254
it was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a prisoner or a free man and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts at the door decided the question in favor of the prison				1063.0027834523742
we will embrace raoul and perhaps he will have news of athos stop an idea cried porthos indeed my dear d artagnan i don t know how you manage but you are always full of ideas let us go and embrace raoul woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said mousqueton to himself i wouldn t give a farthing for his life they set out				352.91867232697047
i was walking about in order to pass away the time till ten o clock when i caught sight of your carriage and horses what you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting with me 40092m no thank you i am thinking of other things besides breakfast just now perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse company what on earth are you talking of i am to fight today for what for the sake of fighting yes i understand that but what is the quarrel				8785.70386617186
so serious that i must take leave of you for a few days so added he turning to renée judge for yourself if it be not important you are going to leave us cried renée unable to hide her emotion at this unexpected announcement				11796.620721348645
often in prison faria had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive dantès you must not give way to this listlessness you will be drowned if you seek to escape and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion these words rang in dantès ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength				3689.4089571373515
how much do you want all you have in gold i have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts i have as much				1678.03189079824
his visit was announced to the governor who on hearing that he came from the cardinal went to meet him and received him at the top of the great flight of steps outside the door				288.6709605474602
the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance two soldiers said d artagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out fine looking men upon my word said d artagnan				11.908509143022522
should dantès not return mercédès might one day be his				1290.2877628215952
i have tried to make you a happy man and you have turned out a murderer oh monsieur said caderousse make one more attempt try me once more i will said the count				229.49541364804438
oh miserable creature that i am cried she clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven				746.3832015900522
but the king is asleep i have something important to reveal to him can it not be put off till to morrow he must know it this moment and perhaps it is already too late come then said lord winter				429.64291171534313
i am going to fight because i am going to fight answered porthos reddening				37037.48345747977
be brave faithful and loyal he said you are brave faithful and loyal				30463.58803688548
that s not fair said the seaman who had saved dantès for you know more than we do what is that to you jacopo returned the captain				1304.1670193251923
then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god				395.12993819964225
this noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper in the midst of a happy dream she grew pale and ran to the window while mme				144.7015392604798
i sent them to carry aid to king charles and they performed prodigies to save him had it not been for an adverse destiny that beloved monarch would this day have been among us but since they served your eminence so well why are they my lord cardinal in prison in prison said mazarin and when has rueil been a prison ever since there were prisoners in it answered comminges				1822.9165839325588
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward				7132.264547668238
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance				3993.396892064482
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry down with mazarin the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied				3033.476612939667
by the way planchet i think you are right with respect to our host and that he is decidedly a frightfully low wretch ah monsieur you may take my word when i tell you anything				3066.0366766212223
remember i have relations who possess more millions than you have deniers				16244.441957820367
ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven o clock then you have received full information concerning my arrival of course ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten 30119m what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my coming oh no it has not but you are sure you are not mistaken very sure it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o clock this evening i will prove it to you beyond a doubt oh no never mind that said the italian it is not worth the trouble yes yes said monte cristo				12.158230451177676
poor woman poor woman what have they done with you you have promised to be secret my good monsieur said the old man				164.21573657452055
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference				18908.021660307382
good said monte cristo smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well disciplined soldier and you leave us said julie at a moment s warning				19060.11775684665
this did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghost for he trod so softly that no sound was heard then poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it				50.48843734595023
refer to your papers you are not busoni you are not monte cristo				17.739481376802004
he fell asleep again and another vision appeared				1568.7652869335552
i am even sorry that this evening i almost repulsed but there will be a conference to morrow and we shall see the two friends saluted the duke				633.0160136881107
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house				617.3770188536465
i forgot to ask you where are you taking me to the cardinal what does he want with me i do not know				1345.7299881206507
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of doubts he said thanks madame thanks for your punctuality and he offered a chair to madame danglars which she accepted for her heart beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated				18938.88169830191
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness				27801.713536728912
it was ten o clock when they arrived				2073.077136653212
believe me the eye of the eagle is closed forever				2412.116804448309
triple ass said athos rising but he sank down again immediately				2627.327774338897
he shed the blood of strafford that confirms what i said just now blood will have blood				1680.1079576540749
come cheer up is there anything that i can do for you i wish to see the governor i have already told you it was impossible why so because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it what is allowed then better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but i wish to see the governor if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hunger that is all the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone				616.7644065497578
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared				1952.9986854465
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night				770.9614103799557
now said athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and i will watch in a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to france but the benign aspect of protecting providence				4264.18553711629
there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently				3967.7689713926165
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family				5514.483565580671
oh all this is a family history as château renaud told you the other day observed maximilian				853.2015309387704
they saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed				2037.4715345971852
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms				720.9867541988567
i am here what do you want with me and at these words the musketeer in irreproachable costume belted as usual with a tolerably firm step entered the cabinet				6129.527089343867
ah thanks felton thanks the young man pressed her to his heart				318.9504078047859
made tréville the captain of his musketeers who were to louis xiii				2190.351437390628
at length with a violent effort at self control the name of that woman he said				539.2836680586253
oh the women the women cried the old soldier				2907.397798860428
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord				5133.058869121789
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room				491.78420302927015
yes replied d artagnan from this very day and mind if the wine is bad we will send him to find better we must use and not abuse said aramis sententiously				43403.490169104305
an opportunity will come replied rochefort				1352.0771464774239
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife				903.0625813700605
30 avenue des champs élysées but i see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no doubt desirous of returning home				2421.39937551722
have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain possession of it				116.61514858399995

d artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with lord de winter and then returned to milady				465.7313878162552

certainly continued danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned				8140.386142359935
her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts				940.0306268724256
it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled				53133.342078788824
m d artagnan my dear m d artagnan he called out in a coaxing voice will you answer for everything i will answer for nothing				413.27202226381314

40152m as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect				13890.73879037512

he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill d artagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts				7741.549553189701
but it s of no importance continued d artagnan with natural assurance it s of no importance				2691.1635350368088

listen hermine i consider myself as brave as most men but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which i had found in my coat that little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring when i opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre i leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked				28807.571086983007
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort				208.9409144557249
gentlemen said the man who was young and pale bowing with ease and courtesy pardon my curiosity but i see you come from paris or at least that you are strangers at boulogne we come from paris yes replied athos with the same courtesy what is there we can do for you sir said the young man will you be so good as to tell me if it be true that cardinal mazarin is no longer minister that is a strange question said aramis				17.619880757124875

i wish i had never seen you cried d artagnan with that ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of politeness because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves that feeling prevails over reason				2380.376443378997
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron d épinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel				3639.026477757589

the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey				2373.447973700733

rise and answer peppino glanced anxiously at franz				468.804828868088
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time				757.6838313378274
however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master				1559.7102477821852
yes i i think sir you exaggerate your situation said madame danglars whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment				1278.200786590205
he perceived his mistake but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness				67853.02053658263
you believe and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the world with his heresies and debaucheries to that infamous sardanapalus whom the blind call the duke of buckingham and whom believers name antichrist i deliver you up to buckingham				766.5749590683789

you will do me the favor to bring us some spanish wine and then to withdraw				10269.461769268974
m d épinay became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their cloaks				6286.432779299681
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself				2378.7879009570297
pardon me for quitting you my dear madame bonacieux said he but not knowing you would come to see me i had made an engagement with a friend				845.3912175054504
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m bertuccio i cried the steward with a strange expression				1419.4539772136245
i address you because you know that although i esteem him from my heart i am a little awed by the comte de la fere but it is understood that what i offer you i offer him at the same time				581.3484078675543
you are convinced now edmond are you not asked the abbé				476.89548758261367

i have had no occasion to notice him particularly he s an old acquaintance				10656.565960684697
the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman has his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor a brigand a rascal has with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence chalais s throat cut under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry monsieur to the queen				355.71921335589735
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention				971.9518987718938
this is all i can say sir if you wish to learn more address yourself to m de boville the inspector of prisons no				942.2992208449214
what is the matter my dear m mouston asked d artagnan				13.984231777013276
au revoir benedetto and running into a court he disappeared				567.9337507987593
the officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy				11603.778266397952
where he was no one knew				5461.070356138481
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded				18945.56564175016
and shall we take no notice of this incident m de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held				7670.499560027444
in a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the count				576.1208917254207
that is the hour when i am expected madame said the young man bowing i can refuse nothing asked of me thus				1922.8091813275496
dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now				1331.7227038558433
cocles went first and the stranger followed him				11.566598995089691
you know it is you alone whom i love how can i know that by the scorn i will throw upon her d artagnan took a pen and wrote madame until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor besides i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them				88.98503149749804
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation				51889.83957078632
come in my dear john said lord de winter come in and shut the door the young officer entered				760.7490726589594
mistrust everything in short even your own shadow fortunately said d artagnan all this will be only necessary till after tomorrow evening for when once with the army we shall have i hope only men to dread in the meantime said athos i renounce my plan of seclusion and wherever you go i will go with you				55.171554428476625
your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl				1522.400220540981
they breakfasted in haste and at six o clock had already gone ten miles				41656.89957921148
did not the messenger say your father s safety depended upon it but what danger threatens him then emmanuel she asked				1303.5546159887713
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue				2343.320158341693
you shall soon have something to drink i give you my word if there is any left grumbled the jeering voice of athos				208.9092342658677
by the lord my good host				917.6783628622541
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athos s lodging and there finish their plans				5519.650343528481
come in come in said morrel for i presume you are all at the door scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly				17311.555824525396
spada a prudent man and greatly attached to his only nephew a young captain of the highest promise took paper and pen and made his will				1898.9185913984415
again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages nay indeed your excellency i am not condemning you for this monsieur baptistin but let your profits end here				533.1370672946418
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a plot				35703.656471885006
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services				15080.095030484232
for all this continued milady i should long ago have revenged myself on him if and i don t know why the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him oh yes but madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of what the mercer s wife of the rue des fossoyeurs				19254.672416588102
calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame				2304.641817442416
la mazzolata gentlemen said the count of monte cristo as he entered i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments besides you sent me word that you would come to me and i have held myself at your disposal franz and i have to thank you a thousand times count returned albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down				713.2427566054355
mordioux answered d artagnan i believe we must				698438.9485663307
in the first place he had made rough work of it one man was killed on the spot and two others were severely wounded				1739.5975840903916
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful				1553.7265653285494
i want friends i want faithful servants				3714.6486167152116
that is to say athos will be chief engineer porthos purveyor in general and aramis governor of the fortress meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau				6760.1473932477065
hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel				23886.529177755347
it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan				2402.578808748111
my first visit is due to my father though i am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me 0029m right dantès quite right				861.1262940065043
in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa				12200.406016308549
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athos s compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it but said d artagnan it is the queen s diamond the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos				13.71857250698867
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it				92.02527387094624
it has four hundred lines and lasts a minute my faith my dear aramis said d artagnan who detested verses almost as much as he did latin add to the merit of the difficulty that of the brevity and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits you will see continued aramis that it breathes irreproachable passion				5166.622374516827
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton				1023.8584277285407
mazarin attempted to open it by a key which he took from his pocket but with such shaking fingers that he could not find the keyhole				47550.630303810736
you have some in the house have you not yes send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic villefort immediately despatched a messenger				1965.1145852820955
i have always said to you i love you as a brother but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is another s is not this true fernand yes that is very true mercédès replied the young man yes you have been cruelly frank with me but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred law to intermarry 0045m you mistake fernand it is not a law but merely a custom and i pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor				3080.753289173609
what do you intend to do				1335.3631307110288
my father meant me for the navy and i have some vague notions about navigation you see cried d artagnan				2.3580422425861496
run for help cried grimaud and i will remain beside him here the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husband s cries				7476.595167890154
these undertakings do not suit me as you know aramis why because it is taking people unawares really athos you would make a singular general				3042.1011584549096
but that must be a princess at least that lady with her negro boy and her maid my god				533.7241290318441
there were also less agreeable visits for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated				4264.856586209272
i confess i am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police for in italy justice is only paid when silent in france she is paid only when she speaks				10294.132359672378
debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly				6834.708735165191
it was done on purpose for me i am sure of it sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty				1619.3993083248943
athos at that moment extended his hand with the air of supreme command which characterized him alone drew out his sword and the scabbard at the same time broke the blade in the sheath on his knee and threw the pieces to his right				896.3190673767106
there is a sort of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie darkness and obscurity				3877.171809805582
are the english expected by land or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers monseigneur replied athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him monseigneur the musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys lackeys grumbled the cardinal				516.3715934828981
why diamonds and she is covered with them to me she seems overloaded observed eugénie she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists see how the artist peeps out exclaimed madame danglars				298.69566746780487
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on l impartial the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor				28352.4054946705
it was like a besieged town				41827.717905067395
all my researches have been useless				2612.346979329046
the baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out				488.60717224476963
morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself				140.2665953970723
you are coming to sup with me are you not				509.0862123976617
porthos could hardly keep his countenance				650.3473713319047
no he muttered the doubt i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness but here the wound reopens and the heart again thirsts for vengeance				2061.7540298733315
treat her as one of your sisters				44045.307128277396
this good major cavalcanti is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the time of the empire when he was on his way to moscow				86389.8771945172
and how said harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you in a very simple manner colonel said d artagnan				1.4387449061455087
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridge box worked with gold and red and green silk sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt				5525.549115872319
how do you feel this morning he inquired				7089.2776390566605
he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him				17.82380010764144
i never visit ministers i leave that to the princes really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant take compassion on us or like jupiter you will wither us up i will not speak again said château renaud pray have compassion upon me and do not take up every word i say come let us endeavor to get to the end of our story beauchamp i told you that yesterday madame made inquiries of me upon the subject enlighten me and i will then communicate my information to her well gentlemen the reason people die so multitudinously i like the word at m de villefort s is that there is an assassin in the house the two young men shuddered for the same idea had more than once occurred to them				59.57255131535194
from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he wanted				4764.983978415124
if the emissaries of the cardinal arrive he will take no notice if it is monsieur d artagnan and his friends he will bring them to us he knows them then doubtless				19903.88457692516
one of them will weed the parliament in the name of the court and the other in the name of the people and then there won t be any parliament at all and who is this colonel bridge asked aramis and how does he go to work to weed the parliament colonel bridge replied the spaniard is a retired wagoner a man of much sense who made one valuable observation whilst driving his team namely that where there happened to be a stone on the road it was much easier to remove the stone than try and make the wheel pass over it				95.19820932885442
the hôtel de la trémouille at these cries all who were in the hôtel rushed out and fell upon the four companions who on their side cried aloud to the rescue musketeers this cry was generally heeded for the musketeers were known to be enemies of the cardinal and were beloved on account of the hatred they bore to his eminence				1393.4642702921997
have the goodness to send mine to athos s residence				6926.976801944402
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man and not more than justice either you ass				47876.066461701055
all would pay deference to an officer like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping girl with impunity ah valentine i assure you you are mistaken if it were otherwise if he treated me diplomatically that is to say like a man who wishes by some means or other to obtain a footing in the house so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its occupants he would if it had been but once have honored me with the smile which you extol so loudly but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no use to him and therefore paid no attention to me whatever				7130.639088972636
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that i will answer for him no he will not desert said the king he can always be found as tréville says				5299.1067147837575
you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his house containing the letter which stopped the signature of the marriage contract				64136.41302977084
there was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this house				693.4488460122598
while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief				1868.2274289070872
but this is not to the purpose our business concerns valentine let us leave the dead in peace all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was something in the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium				2723.5743439938974
there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so la ramee when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss				19359.587803415365
because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the hour murderers choose oh heavens exclaimed valentine wiping off the drops which ran down her forehead				1604.8888549846772
beauchamp one of the kings of the press and therefore claiming the right of a throne everywhere was eying everybody through his monocle				40102.33168253263
is then all that i have heard really true she inquired				7231.417936788406
at the door of the chapel d artagnan felt his courage fall anew and returned to look for athos but athos had disappeared				475.3602750924247
everything lies in the execution good the execution of plots is my forte i know it well				705.0001215042386
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom				149645.8930334654
the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground				1274.936248193482
i do not wish to be left alone mother said the young man you know how gladly i would obey your wish but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the whole evening well replied mercédès sighing go albert i will not make you a slave to your filial piety albert pretended he did not hear bowed to his mother and quitted her				133.2453128612371
it appeared that i was surrounded with unknown dangers into which i was about to fall at every instant				1518.8552482992975
d artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting yes count nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since then said athos in a tone of delight he is well				819.3543054952881
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same				1274.9836681595723
ah said porthos what a fearful day my dear d artagnan what				1086.0329351799678
i had fixed the embarkation for the twenty fourth but i have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will be				1222.399552771612
it is quite immaterial to me said monte cristo and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle				6070.886028902857
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him				13.164595924577956
at the slightest noise he bounded towards the door				246.67693592912016
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning				1752.14324311598
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires				5727.842957843343
it is sacrilege to struggle against so many things my lord				510.40046176862694
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did				3748.3844027363025
he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing				13310.409150521846
as the mayor had foreseen the sight of the guards had exasperated the mob				24111.210252993325
i called you because you were running like a madman and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the sea said caderousse laughing				889.5003534643239
i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded 6 000 francs				786.6003601392816
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger				2274.3167737308618
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran s morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear				1608.1974646872063
hem thought monte cristo he begins to conceal his losses a month since he boasted of them then aloud oh madame m danglars is so skilful he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere i see that you participate in a prevalent error said madame danglars				298.8726169181821
a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentine s room opened and monte cristo reappeared				6104.052557645682
once concealed with her at armentières it would be easy to make her believe that d artagnan had not come to béthune				3454.0430423175767
ah diable said the host to himself this man seems dumb				12005.976738652294
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment				1198.384715267036
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon				3334.498969440704
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing decidedly my dear athos said d artagnan i should like better not to risk anything that s a pity said athos coolly				6236.268247312752
to be overwhelmed with insults and ignominy				27987.877490954925
i shall be with mine under the third				12948.962924037578
take him and teach him to be as brave and loyal as you are yourself then replied d artagnan though i shall not have you athos at all events i shall have that dear fair haired head by me and though he s but a boy yet since your soul lives again in him dear athos i shall always fancy that you are near me sustaining and encouraging me the four friends embraced with tears in their eyes				786.576730436547
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right albert s breakfast room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden				1346.8881022524592
tell me he said tell me what you want well then i want you to take me up in your fine carriage and carry me back andrea turned pale but said nothing				253.66162794565352
d artagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their posts				6102.102740946535
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient				14317.853078336539
here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm				848.5955811448218
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances d artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once				1232.5763117421757
no she must have conceived some pathetic scene she will come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here will there appear ridiculous the blush of pride mounted to the count s forehead as this thought passed through his mind				702.4364533629576
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood				2927.072681192231
friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that shall i take out any more of them asked porthos				18.874550383428026
d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen				11417.920534500143
the daily renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer a service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy				16582.774688662088
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose suddenly				3366.8237867281696
it is his voice all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness				1321.7151948396086
they are no longer sure planchet and bazin were called and took the places of grimaud and mousqueton				1646.9424966652925
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles				1859.8199457265614
isn t it so kitty i do not care where i live said kitty provided i am well concealed and nobody knows where i am meanwhile kitty when we are about to separate and you are no longer jealous of me monsieur chevalier far off or near said kitty i shall always love you where the devil will constancy niche itself next murmured athos				86.32060854685551
die in peace and i said m d artagnan				4.600788001150082
after a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket he found rita senseless in the arms of cucumetto				4565.937796466254
he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against iron and wood				2855.544718778418
and i asked mazarin after a moment s silence				537.1504634106242
thou must add said d artagnan that a gentleman who is passing by wishes to have the honor of paying his respects to the comte de la fere and if thou art satisfied with what thou hearest then mention my name planchet leading his horse by the bridle drew near to the gate and rang the bell and immediately a servant man with white hair and of erect stature notwithstanding his age presented himself				147.4604253902435
if i am an officer your fortune is certain for i shall have money enough for both and moreover a name we shall both be proud of since it will be our own				1001.9049651698308
but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned said felton with increasing exultation				16473.383998877627
you lie said the abbé busoni with a tone of irresistible authority				2726.2145842425284
close by here monsieur replied the notary a little beyond passy a charming situation in the heart of the bois de boulogne so near as that said the count but that is not in the country				3440.1570379843834
full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape				884.2336825778622
then he arranged all his beautiful turkish arms his fine english guns his japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by feuchères or barye examined the cupboards and placed the key in each threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the pocket money he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel boxes then he made an exact inventory of everything and placed it in the most conspicuous part of the table after putting aside the books and papers which had collected there				630.8723223865691
well louis said anne why do you not kiss me i thought you were angry with me madame you sent me away i do not send you away but you have had the small pox and i am afraid that sitting up late may tire you you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion sire interposed laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle to any one laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except mancini now mancini was a nephew of mazarin s and was as much hated by louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister				4251.419156282511
we set out last evening and here we are here you are his eminence had something to communicate to her majesty something secret and private a mission that could be confided only to a sure man and so has sent me to saint germain				4265.328417273207
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued d artagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen aramis colored imperceptibly				7723.173168986261
speak if you please said mazarin				116.52810140942115
monsieur du tremblay received d artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake				153948.01658605822
i have been heaven s substitute to recompense the good now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked at these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea				1996.069203291881
yes but said the notary you are aware that the law does not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony yes you only intend then to dispose of that part of your fortune which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son noirtier made no answer				1284.3347739904814
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted				3537.8051064824026
the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg saint honoré and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen garden of about an acre				28955.838714738977
where is athos in the cellar monsieur what you scoundrel				12107.886326485122
all three then cried all s over hush said d artagnan				1.5032730265843501
then the count threw the bridle of his horse into the hands of a peasant remounted the steps went into the cathedral there to kneel down in the darkest corner and pray				6241.77794332983
the procureur went out after having double locked the door				262.5581857018011
at the same time aramis made his appearance at the other end of the street upon a superb english charger				12313.262785925486
he comprehended that the musket had not come there of itself and that he who bore it had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions				5914.6879274526555
d artagnan was beside himself with joy				514.9488981847984
as it drew near he recognized it as the boat he had given to jacopo				9145.964299348803
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château d if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery				25937.930778962105
if that be the case said d artagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another				533.7549243593702
ah count said albert i assure you madame de morcerf speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four days we have spoken of no one else you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle then i am also a puzzle to your mother				990.2191978263202
the names have been purposely concealed my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he can not tell you proper names are not in the dictionary oh misery cried franz the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father				660.7892183423975
speak said charles attempting to look across the hedge of guards which surrounded him				23.138305843833454
the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman				656.6252603685654
he is not curious thought d artagnan				2.6611293131440887
in each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be levied				12082.15239969335
oh i repeat it edmond what you have just done is beautiful it is grand it is sublime do you say so now mercédès then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you				46.68677979433331
this is the matter gentlemen answer and exculpate yourselves for i stand here to accuse you sire said lord leven with hesitation sire your majesty has been deceived by false reports my own eyes have seen the enemy extend itself between myself and scotland and i can almost say that with my own ears i have heard the clauses of the treaty debated the scotch chieftains looked at each other in their turn with frowning brows				9913.327676506768
i was promised he should die with me				44.09352987981876
remember at a later period and at a certain moment if any mischance should happen to you said richelieu significantly that it was i who came to seek you and that i did all in my power to prevent this misfortune befalling you i shall entertain whatever may happen said d artagnan placing his hand upon his breast and bowing an eternal gratitude toward your eminence for that which you now do for me well let it be then as you have said monsieur d artagnan we shall see each other again after the campaign				18507.715777365174
mine was carried away by a ball				3392.812689944826
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter				2175.0310964992645
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn				1887.5042101616712
my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand				14012.922439144999
we have experienced the ingratitude of the great as you well know tis true replied d artagnan				1.4423350027026105
at nine o clock next morning she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least sign of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous night then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to m de villefort s house				563.8887537956435
see here are two similar letters to that you have yourself received one from the house of arstein eskeles of vienna to baron rothschild the other drawn by baring of london upon m lafitte				608883.185014501
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with you are either cowards or traitors the eyes of the scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king				712.0326858449257
do not lose time comminges he continued get out of the carriage if you can and make another draw up be quick or in five minutes the mob will be on us again with swords and muskets and you will be killed				3942.591265496854
i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them				82.62811788300509
she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good bye to you in full dress noirtier again closed his left eye				1310.8218375742515
ah said morcerf there goes a happy man and it so happened albert was not mistaken in his opinion				3151.7696748575477
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages				6574.893884336841
there were but three hôtels in this part of the street and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied the other belonging to aramis himself				459.60800115336605
if we had you my friends				364.2597466166036
you were recommended to monsieur de tréville were you not yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence yes i know that				347.4382290846795
did you know that i am at liberty i knew it from the fountain head from planchet				671.8554036472233
mademoiselle de villefort took from the hands of barrois who was sent out the lemonade which m noirtier had every morning and he has escaped by a miracle				18118.010011361373
which whichever of the three you like i have no preference and the rich caparison is that mine too without doubt you laugh d artagnan no i have left off laughing now that you speak french what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silver are they all for me for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos peste they are three superb animals i am glad they please you why it must have been the king who made you such a present certainly it was not the cardinal but don t trouble yourself whence they come think only that one of the three is your property i choose that which the red headed boy is leading it is yours good heaven				1005.2758625721715
well i will amuse you how by introducing to you a new acquaintance a man or a woman a man i know so many men already but you do not know this man where does he come from the end of the world farther still perhaps the deuce				8420.781102768213
monte cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with m de boville who was standing in the waiting room and who was introduced into danglars room as soon as the count had left				957.1437511810545
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fro of busy people				939.5587470160484
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the 4 500 francs into the hands of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the night in riding in the champs élysées				4233.584568546897
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both				3037.5584144012214
the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest				2984.4282984198617
it was m de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers				18521.66479454089
one is that of edmond dantès lost to me long long since				7452.448481384138
noirtier s room was opened like all the rest				2323.405242566222
the doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel mockery muttered athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which porthos had just mounted				16195.252319330772
deuce take it all the worse for me how there is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a courtier is to know when to forget but you guitant are not a courtier				8556.269067456076

but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust well such things have been that there should be a famine recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans so much the better				973.321932500368

he didn t predict the future he knew the past often a more dangerous thing mazarin nodded an assent but wishing to know what this prediction was about which they disputed he remained in the same place				787.7816238659761
so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the end of his teeth and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned unquestionably so that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at the same time precisely 20027m but some official document was drawn up as to this affair i suppose inquired the englishman				1984.6896826298237

they proceeded silently to the centre of the place but as at this very moment the moon had just emerged from behind a cloud they thought they might be observed if they remained on that spot and therefore regained the shade of the lime trees				2890.5733367745306
his carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart said julie				11630.434174317827
woman was created for our destruction and it is from her we inherit all our miseries at this speech of aramis the brow of athos became clouded and he bit his lips				543.8215596366566
no my friend replied athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defend king charles we have but ill defended him it remains for us to save him to save the king said d artagnan looking at aramis as he had looked at athos				73.82491679016229
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver general				3115.7129922025524
as to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its disappearance				18444.58255854626
m bonacieux who was ignorant that d artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m de laffemas whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinal s executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture				24302.333091574903
all he possessed was 15 257 francs				942.6106533331051
athos repeated m de tréville himself				424.4329616872344
one of my friends one of my friends please to observe not myself said athos interrupting himself with a melancholy smile one of the counts of my province that is to say of berry noble as a dandolo or a montmorency at twenty five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen beautiful as fancy can paint				29526.631711814145
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourself whom he considered the first three personages in france d artagnan added m de tréville to the others as may be perceived but he thought this addition would do no harm				37105.68172126532
now nothing of the kind has happened what then asked hermine trembling violently				3615.6382739186824
you know or you don t know that that is what we ask of you oh				788.2637219961243
ah added the count in a contemptuous tone do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old age of cruelty really count replied franz one would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world there are at least few that i have not seen said the count coldly				12999.730514242741
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men what are your commands lieutenant take the detachment and conduct him to his place but you will be left alone certainly				2633.2891212994737
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean				38748.30237409686
return to camp and you shall know rochefort remained for a moment in thought then as they were only a day s journey from surgères whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of athos and go with them				84.44327261691102
mazarin now understood that cromwell s envoy desired to retain his incognito				63083.32569034788
stop there madame for this can not last				2588.6924364502843
scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cæsar s podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a half dilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin				5292.12720964309
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here				866.8383603386538
the sight of marks renewed edmond fondest hopes				4485.612677598714

you make me young and happy again by it				61.73122370850746
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort				2336.586450700363
at the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed				34027.55896337236
a captain is nothing but a father of a family charged with even a greater responsibility than the father of an ordinary family				4803.363891082013
and then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old friend				436.87664523860076
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts				9036.445569284391
charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip				8337.897460180759

it was evident that there was clamor and sedition				21267.965176218404
a prisoner you will not recover your liberty through me living you will not lose your life through me yes cried milady but i shall lose that which is much dearer to me than life i shall lose my honor felton and it is you you whom i make responsible before god and before men for my shame and my infamy this time felton immovable as he was or appeared to be could not resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him				108.44266494014894
you will in turn enter it my dear d épinay for you will soon be numbered as one of the family				5157.751049819379
but he has wealth i believe already doubtless he has				32913.52625656825
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts				23369.185720457164
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction				10004.5704231133
no monsieur he has not a lady with him with whom is he then with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of amiens good heavens cried d artagnan is the poor fellow worse then no monsieur quite the contrary but after his illness grace touched him and he determined to take orders that s it said d artagnan i had forgotten that he was only a musketeer for a time monsieur still insists upon seeing him more than ever well monsieur has only to take the right hand staircase in the courtyard and knock at number five on the second floor d artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old fashioned taverns				48424.98724971803
i will answer for it said bonacieux				3695.3776282382482
villefort was no longer the civilized man he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound				3671.308626752076
that can only be to hold gloves he said				490.1346816894931
but why did she return to tours without telling me anything because she was in fear of being arrested why has she not written to me then because she was afraid of compromising you d artagnan you restore me to life cried aramis				22.691300673386174
jesus seigneur no sooner had he uttered this cry than the door opened and athos and aramis rushed out				234.93740446518993
it is the people who do not obey that i punish and not those who like you obey but too well				828.1441717293029
the general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly room				513.0592083639762
oh signora if i could but speak greek your conversation added to the fairy scene which surrounds me would furnish an evening of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you sir said haydée quietly and if you like what is eastern i will do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here on what subject shall i converse with her said albert in a low tone to monte cristo				8.185379047176395
after charles i cromwell after cromwell charles ii and then james ii and then some son in law or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a king				963.7753156995192
art thou dumb cried the duke				485.3321619938156
this calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest dejection would have been				1936.2504517260918
dantès would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor				2939.146913829652
but d artagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to kitty s door				168.71711204767112
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also				1197.5387197312416
is there any crime in this request no sire then you will appear yes sire that is well said the king retiring that is well i count upon it the queen made a curtsy less from etiquette than because her knees were sinking under her				267.6583059589343
but know you who he was he used to be the headsman of bethune you knew him				14.27965629878055
my lord de winter continued athos what is the penalty you demand against this woman the punishment of death replied lord de winter				372.3073400287498
she is called the fair indian excuse me sir returned raoul blushing still more deeply i know no more than i did before				587.168231791521
the duke undid his belt and gave it to grimaud who tied la ramee in such a way as to satisfy him				42.935924711946555
i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry true said andrea				355.95268725290305
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo				6.17873222962909
at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade				53830.151166715725
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countess s visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone you were with her then i was and what did you say to her oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead				847.4649562401692
grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent				42837.72781343219
hold sir said villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene				1903.3451769756716
dantès was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead				1762.077669988645
your profession first i was a forger answered andrea as calmly as possible then i became a thief and lately have become an assassin a murmur or rather storm of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly				3378.46716259444
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament				27168.515722655662
the magistrates freely discussed their political views the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of josephine				46900.653852352385
i love and esteem you because honest folks are so rare				18842.35487282976
but without taking any heed of the sword milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat				2862.0580029818198
i admire i love him for i know his former adventures but i shall not speak to him until the day after to morrow and why day after to morrow asked madame de chevreuse				4216.92254232217
and i too he exclaimed in a low voice i unite with m morrel in demanding justice for crime my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession oh merciful heavens murmured villefort				114.32029740503566
lord de winter exclaimed the count				237.8447560904489
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way				907.9342903388405
let us pursue him and we shall overtake him my dear friend said aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him				19.361986251296777
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other				478.3783994751593
in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants we have forgotten to mention that the count s coachman was attired in a bear skin exactly resembling odry s in the bear and the pasha and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed				1825.5000389131212
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his horse				1073.3234568793875
at last in an hour after the scene we have just described she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door				270.33638996875
the time of the carnival was at hand				554.6410945238338
no the sacrifice returned château renaud ask debray if he would sacrifice his english steed for a stranger not for a stranger said debray but for a friend i might perhaps i divined that you would become mine count replied morrel besides as i had the honor to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that day i owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good fortune had on other days granted to us the history to which m morrel alludes continued château renaud is an admirable one which he will tell you some day when you are better acquainted with him today let us fill our stomachs and not our memories				15195.920343253189
the count then hastened to us and took us into his house where he speedily recalled my poor edward to life				339.4919635945196
oh leave me sir you are tempting me you make me doubt the goodness of providence it is impossible it can not be are you the first that this hand has stricken				6550.6100474246405

this feeling lasted but for a moment				1277.4391465608078
athos and aramis again questioned planchet but he had seen nothing of d artagnan they wished to take planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five o clock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis xiii				2188.424247708437
it was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short summer the clouds which m de villefort had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic and one of the softest and most brilliant days of september shone forth in all its splendor				7380.475325382823
beware sir replied the president you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals do not insult them unless you wish to be held responsible but instead of listening m d épinay went on you are still as brave in your carriage as in your assembly because you are still four against one the president stopped the coach				17925.604106940467

on the 1st morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things				4740.187171417331
he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present				2382.2545598128436
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him				13.757674490920182
monsieur d artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity				5639.3313928630205
by eight o clock in the morning he was at the apartment of athos				456.41679228239286
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution				26819.08115311838
if we were to make ourselves known we should be sent to rejoin our friends in some deep ditch from which the devil himself could not take us out				407.78858383136503
you have had a proof of that in what you have just related to me this too was the opinion of comminges who withdrew somewhat reassured				8766.286770193667
scarcely had he turned the corner of the rue de la juiverie when the boy rushed after him like a bloodhound on full scent				28235.164284267452
the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the bone				26179.635632388534
she had many a time felt humiliated by the self sacrifice and disinterestedness shown by the gascon gentleman				1816.100653093195
at these words madame morrel rose and threw herself into her son s arms				458.37972965207183
touch nothing my little friend cried the count eagerly some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale madame de villefort became very pale and seizing her son s arm drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket which was not lost upon the count				363.54882276359024
you who love and are beloved you who have faith and hope oh do not follow my example				1920.6740678380743
that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers very well monsieur i will obey you at all points athos made two visits in paris at seven o clock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen				16920.777902388905
danglars listened with the most profound attention he had expected this declaration for the last two or three days and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to morcerf				716.2569579458708
on my side i have two sure men who have been in action with my father				779.915366684433

someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone				1665.683259842786
then placing herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard gate cried she with her finest contralto voice and rapping at the window				1169.4480749372444
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it				31.769367235911076
our béarnais was a prudent lad however young he might be				1433.02358386007

cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice said he and mademoiselle eugénie a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like thalberg				37594.27035511068
bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed				2034.9393275469347
it appears she resumed that he sold it he sold it in order to save me another time to be able to send a messenger to the duke to warn him of his danger he sold it to monsieur des essarts on whose finger i remarked it				27.335267261957068
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them dantès sighed heavily				13580.92234338675
but you say you do not wish to kill me no and yet you will let me perish with hunger ah that is a different thing well then wretches cried danglars i will defy your infamous calculations i would rather die at once				853.3805585239452

we will see my dear monsieur if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice box you see plainly that i have no sword said the englishman				1145.4156174270934
my dear friend general cromwell has sent monsieur mordaunt to fetch me				60.377524931827125
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through fear				1658.6103458688308
he again ran back to the château				50873.001083225594
i am something of a physician and have like my fellows sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead matter yet like providence it has remained invisible to my eyes although present to my heart				371.67764173921296
the light of day reassured me i went and threw myself on the bed without parting with the emancipating knife which i concealed under my pillow				6662.396307160035
suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered look on his companion				1845.0739539806216
my mother gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned				20568.315960843574
it was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand				546.8929619870806
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped				1133.4982074870347
porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied				9916.296704030266
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle				10352.66167071672
no madame replied monte cristo but you see i make no resistance we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the grove the count looked at mercédès as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in silence and he refrained from speaking				2540.4402175628857
villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him				24.662482579138608
he wouldn t listen put his foot on the spur to get down the spur broke he fell with a broken leg and instead of keeping quiet took to crying out like a gallows bird				3301.7853883652097
i must live henceforth without rank and fortune and to begin this hard apprenticeship i must borrow from a friend the loaf i shall eat until i have earned one				521.5618310507068

luigi vampa if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven o clock the count albert will have ceased to live this second signature explained everything to franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for him				38.1232949012207
but this time milady lent a more attentive ear than the first and she heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor				11905.86727409988
the councillor placed himself at the window the street was completely deserted but in the distance was heard like the noise of the tide rushing in the deep hum of the populous waves increasing now around notre dame				2341.6792987566296
each examined his arms and put them in order				1968.549022192324
as to d artagnan he did not budge from his apartment				562.8593344991366
why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you				27.911847944081615
it is eleven o clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king charles i				1937.4464635902611
the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly 30293m then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbé busoni				2822.6130767669365
certainly said monte cristo slightly shrugging his shoulders otherwise i would not fight with m de morcerf				720.1270963327721
but i am not surprised the spring has been warm this year and strawberries require heat sir				711.0606147522966
he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter				1528.835421821708
it seemed to explain to him the change in athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence				2005.992507968546
perhaps said athos but at all events listen well to this				1111.2881828239902
the penalty of death i greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill him				11.880776851519647
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself				1111.760427153847
well signor pastrini said franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi vampa				2158.759454554198
monte cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured here beneath this plane tree must have been where the infant s grave was dug				17345.797506929353
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless				27095.93553056786
we let them tell their story out replied mousqueton				477.5374188358128
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice s steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins				26489.59703000631
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head				415.10996967232865
my senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities				20132.782821679837
and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked cavalcanti				2903.5850512606626
the following day dantès presented jacopo with an entirely new vessel accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named louis dantès residing in the allées de meilhan and also a young woman called mercédès an inhabitant of the catalan village				2804.715397265565
28 rue de la fontaine in a room hung with red damask my father took me in his arms telling my mother i was dead wrapped me in a napkin marked with an h and an n and carried me into a garden where he buried me alive a shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of m de villefort				277.9667459725425
had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to 205 and instead of gaining 300 000 francs he would have lost 20 or 25 000 and what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206 asked monte cristo				491.4625729022067

himself my lord but he is said to be a furious mazarinist phew whistled planchet				1172.8260863017686
should it not be found in the possession of father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the pharaon but said renée this letter which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the king s attorney 0093m true but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters thinking this one of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party then the guilty person is absolutely in custody said the marquise				1767.908368247966
the dappled grays volume three chapter 48				11609.445557257926

on his side d artagnan became more cautious also				1190.4249012816329
each of them from time to time kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them				77.68117672702746
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only half aroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake				4010.181410197249
why didst thou take it yes why asked la ramee				598.7305298790052
come reflect and decide your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied d artagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely d artagnan paused				2930.192419054954
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you maximilian whom i love as my own son				936.7101049365021

his heart swelled by the intoxication of joy felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial paradise called love				998.1116985199773
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach				6812.959968172209
well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one and let us drink what asked the host quite cheerful again				435.248756120989
had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice but unluckily mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss				7469.853005656254
it seems that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless no that his style of writing is very good this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out albert laughed				4193.397871300453
some voices even added long live the marshal but all took up the cry in chorus down with mazarin the crowd gave place the barricade was opened and the marshal with the remnant of his company retreated preceded by friquet and his bandits some of them making a presence of beating drums and others imitating the sound of the trumpet				21314.60563243395

dantès made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist				29972.36538096195
the sentinel wanted to repulse him but felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said a pressing message from lord de winter at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his grace s most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer				2022.7381912842475

are you also the victim of a treachery no said the novice but of my devotion of a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still and who has abandoned you is that it i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me				135.48044395385463
a few steps in advance of the gate of saint honore they met a third troop this latter party was composed of ill looking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache				6025.859839972407
it was not without foundation that a report of the king s intention to leave paris by night had been circulated				12015.346322386536

a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me				248.11412850868086
do you know that i am to be beheaded outside this window				1075.6962238742108
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new bridge				11980.425132706912
but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given				2336.682271391959
the skiff lightning d artagnan had judged correctly mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none				3813.677915794663

the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris				270.5046652187664
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m noirtier i know it is very bitter said valentine so bitter that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter				9228.788702995225
the general remark is oh it can not be expected that one of so stern a character as m villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters				13298.710615154223
i am sure of it they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step				3067.405414247716
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o clock was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one muttered d artagnan				1.9006006207313104
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes				641.203856356494
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would i give up five years of my pay which i am never paid by the way to make the king five years older really				3541.2718134333427
but you are deceived edmond she continued				4672.090061327304

edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins				5373.641382468001
but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and i depend on having he his barony and i my promotion on the honor of mazarin i should like another sort of oath better said d artagnan to himself then aloud may i not offer my duty to her majesty the queen her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied mazarin go pray sir one word more my lord if there s any fighting where i m going must i fight you are to obey the commands of the personage to whom i have addressed the inclosed letter tis well said d artagnan holding out his hand to receive the money				813.8922635890164

it appears the conquerors had something else to do well well we shall find their muskets their cartridges and their flasks and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls we shall have fifteen guns and a hundred charges to fire oh athos said aramis truly you are a great man porthos nodded in sign of agreement				2752.1924870286784
she lived in the place royale then the fashionable quarter at number 6 and he undertook to call and take d artagnan with him in order to introduce him				33.46440415081211
suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed				1744.4760934534002
since my misfortunes i have been subject to faintnesses which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver				21817.278679004325

an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques unfortunately the general s valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker s lips turned alternately red and pale				1136.1616435801259
it is a false diamond said caderousse				187.77290994682227

nogent beautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment this caused a universal burst of laughter				1502.599514258213
bertuccio sat down upon the chair andrea threw himself upon the bed the keeper retired				1377.1589964799575
i do sometimes soldier though i am monte cristo advanced into the room maximilian was obliged to let him pass but he followed him				13.12866317689348
the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes				13111.025563461088
when she wakes she can sup and he made some steps toward the door				217.842614459725

yield you yield to me do you not a giant had seized also aramis s two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp				8781.917509847184
perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate d artagnan drew up his request and m de tréville on receiving it assured him that by two o clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers				15842.071944079897
but this time our gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived from the love which kitty had just confessed so innocently or so boldly the interception of letters addressed to the comte de wardes news on the spot entrance at all hours into kitty s chamber which was contiguous to her mistress s				937.5341048421262
you have told me yourself madame that i have been drawn into a snare i perhaps may leave my life in it for although it may be strange i have for some time had a presentiment that i should shortly die and the duke smiled with a smile at once sad and charming				5786.281875181358
from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a mark the trunk of some old and moss grown olive tree that grew on the sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand				270.4394058339853
and will it be the first time you have ever been there dantès yes have you business there not of my own the last commission of poor captain leclere you know to what i allude danglars it is sacred				22085.50883930423

and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass				3410.073278859366

how hot you look my good barrois said valentine				209.35858511622436
i am well i want nothing do not call him she gave so much vehemence such magnetic eloquence to this exclamation that felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into the room				432.9855952569013
call for me at eight o clock or shall i wait supper for you at seven that will do very well said aramis				18.811255636341976
unhappily those times are past nonsense				5489.151374287433
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption				9064.40186344761
he was called benedetto but he is ignorant of his real name having never known his parents sign it continued the count				528.9036676640021

you know wine is a deceiver but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side and hand in hand				381.89059341144184
there he said is our road the deuce				7899.6678747377855
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for god s sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us				150.48315722070055
here it is said aramis with a little look of diffidence which however was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes et qui trainez des jours infortunés tous vos malheurs se verront terminés quand à dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes vous qui pleurez you who weep for pleasures fled while dragging on a life of care all your woes will melt in air if to god your tears are shed you who weep d artagnan and the curate appeared pleased				29988.9486144284

morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance he had moreover his right of entry into the omnibus box				1446.261475499651
as to lord de winter he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on milady and when she was come he recommended the prisoner who was still fainting to her care and left them alone				1123.9256300784798
the joy of the king was lively				25581.91759610975
stay where you are i will go myself and with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground d artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier				3157.9043858159203
have you seen alas did you recognize valentine groaned				5701.057611121152
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her and where luigi awaited her				105.29078289883705
now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table				875.7838418927623
still the walls seemed to be closing on him they appeared to be in concert with his enemies				1452.8922617533308
adieu raoul said the count adieu my dearest boy adieu sir adieu my beloved protector athos waved his hand he dared not trust himself to speak and raoul went away his head uncovered				36510.24574659663

but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out				557.5765567151249
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that				489.8159988565023
it is the first time he has ever been in paris				359.90682709465534
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career				8981.639332485673

the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with château renaud and beauchamp				1080.0722031017406
no i feel that i have reached the goal and i will go no farther				4499.863274579813
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction				4022.1351653495144
but since you say nothing remains but for m d épinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to m d épinay for he came this morning to paris valentine uttered a cry				1849.4332249211823
sire go leave france to its real master to him who acquired it not by purchase but by right of conquest go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint louis to owe his life to the man of arcola marengo austerlitz tell him this gérard or rather tell him nothing				600.7248999721012
but we find it thus in the manuscript and we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it				36.02963392589299

he was about to marry her when one of the caprices of fate which would almost make us doubt the goodness of providence if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end one of those caprices deprived him of his mistress of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present and cast him into a dungeon ah said morrel one quits a dungeon in a week a month or a year he remained there fourteen years morrel said the count placing his hand on the young man s shoulder				807.8173148702074

d artagnan seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard				1890.2801485051677
vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover				3189.6304150827336
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer				1040.5736312633392

i am profoundly ignorant of all these stock jobbing intrigues because said albert laughing one piece of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them ah said the count i see that m danglars is accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300 000 francs in a day he must be enormously rich it is not he who plays exclaimed lucien it is madame danglars she is indeed daring but you who are a reasonable being lucien and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountain head surely you ought to prevent it said morcerf with a smile				397.92982590317195

it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready				851.7820341084226

its purple visage and its violet colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet				1390.5397523717222

why thou art posted here by heaven no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses is aramis here yes sir he has been here since yesterday what are you doing on the watch what				1036.4461438334977
he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his hand and he had orders to blow up everything kiosk guards women gold and ali tepelini himself at the first signal given by my father				483.77394257601435
upon my word you would make caesar afraid the matter is replied d artagnan that i can see upon this pier neither inspector nor sentinel nor exciseman and you complain of that said porthos				17.877514138277913
the guards retired the room resumed its obscurity				3992.6924002035025
the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding				24256.024247373087
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again				232.6786678683033
war between england and france was talked of as near and certain and the jolly sailors were having a carousal				23516.337429103016
and remember my life depends on your answer				1109.2007363182145
shall you keep it or send it back i shall keep it aramis and even though i had no need of it i still should keep it				48.90612242971933
in spite of all appearances be so kind therefore as to finish your duty by fulfilling the formalities described by law let the irons be heated said the doctor but really it is a useless precaution this order to heat the irons made dantès shudder				5117.408134296704
i am a criminal as it appears				16110.143134617161
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband				2178.5477519277847
my dear count you can not imagine how my mind is harassed				29507.96833475473
it is a folly i admit but still it is the fashion				4298.314469362879
i swear to you i protest oh but god is above				10447.280505985033
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road				2533.114704853591
it was indeed planchet and grimaud				784.627291022526
your excellencies permit it asked the host				691.6263206461882
when her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face				678.9068768400131
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me hark said morrel				86.74457428619397
among worldly people manner is contagious				19095.614378894537
without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance				3082.5019162396607
you know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor broussel the father of the people really did they said d artagnan				1.5739369333935807
he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one and the tomb of the other				768.3890414544102
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands daume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusement s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project				3629.429489614688
go on your advice then to take the hundred pistoles d artagnan				13.894904339582563
she cast a glance at the door the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating				28018.108380203208
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night s adventure i don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one				492.69537891109053
he recalled a bit of advice which athos had once given him and made his horse rear				8580.849267938842
who has given them to us said porthos				17.52866394257334
nevertheless he understood it all but was deaf				39856.56341458649
having given various orders to bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the house the count drawing out his watch said to the attentive nubian it is half past eleven o clock haydée will soon be here				961.2863202822532
what do you say asked his wife pale as death				691.8638124651064
he took his seat amongst them they played and i won				12159.391172085561
now said the baron look at this woman				612.7411161379854
he is dead and no mistake about it oh yes and they may have the fact attested whenever they please so be it said the englishman				1159.9855581677014
are you still friends with monsieur porthos and monsieur aramis add monsieur d artagnan my lord				686.047406873247
i swear to you on my honor said he to await your decision respecting the course i am to pursue with m d épinay that is right said the old man				164.61714369969297
it was even told me that fernand especially was terrible in his vengeance fernand smiled piteously				121501.00838417416
pray learn monsieur olivain that people like us are not to be served by cowards				28666.18576370715
you can t imagine my dear fellow the sort of man he is				1169.4079258130898
the young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed aloud				4823.9299782930775
everything goes on capitally my dear monsieur bernouin but here is a man whom i must beg you to put in a safe place where then sir where you like provided that the place which you shall choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that can be locked we have that sir replied bernouin and the poor coachman was conducted to a closet the windows of which were barred and which looked very much like a prison				1053.30205791855
are you no longer my master or have i ceased to be your slave monte cristo returned her smile				614.6848370428768
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another proof of god s mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my father s tomb by your father s tomb said caderousse supported by a supernatural power and half raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred who then are you the count had watched the approach of death				489.997276869085
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold				1783.0134165084692
my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me				115.28891611356396
inform this dear friend that he may remain within that i shall go and see him immediately sir i obey with pleasure if her majesty will permit me to depart go monsieur de bragelonne said the queen and rest assured of our affection raoul bent respectfully before the two princesses and bowing to de winter departed				6488.107556396839
what do you see a troop of how many persons twenty men what sort of men sixteen pioneers four soldiers how far distant five hundred paces good				1322.6016134905342
athos foreseeing the period when he should make a soldier of the viscount had inured him to all kinds of arduous undertakings				15326.79237869285
neffer neffer d artagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out				570.9706017496576
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the world				970.7124633071404
we lived together we loved we hated together we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably i may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship perhaps there may be the bond of crime for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life				574.6711203748008
delirium he repeated delirium do you say				990.3334703600158
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream				71733.26305374851
planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his shadow and was soon trotting by his side				906.990113499985
it would indeed be strange if she checked herself				719.7192724267454
well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel				2131.841664004143
what he is that is quite another thing				1795.1735462026431
is it broken off yesterday morning it appears franz declined the honor indeed				782.3050834503365
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch				3670.069399554129
you offered me hospitality and i accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof caderousse stammered out something while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow				676.8123568327404
the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning the subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever but remarked madame de villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond ah that is where the art comes in				626.8631075699129
now if i entreat if i order you to live morrel it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your life oh heavens said the young man oh heavens what are you saying count				185.74872105638758
oh tomorrow tomorrow i must have some pledge from you which will prove that you think of me and that you may not forget me take this and she slipped a ring from her finger onto d artagnan s				802.7938480661822
if she had been a great lady she would have fainted but as she was only a procurator s wife she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury eh monsieur porthos you don t offer me any holy water porthos at the sound of that voice started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years				2508.032395441174
the inspector could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote nothing to be done this visit had infused new vigor into dantès he had till then forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date 30th july 1816 and made a mark every day in order not to lose his reckoning again				163.9084456840388
act then as you think proper there is still time to withdraw no monsieur no you appear to be an honest young man and i will have confidence in you				104.78316701345146
do not fear pardieu we are alone i think i have discovered my father your true father yes not old cavalcanti no for he has gone again the true one as you say and that father is well caderousse it is monte cristo bah yes you understand that explains all				210.37391391182322
now sir continued morrel in these days no one can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like valentine				798.4192830326001
at blois d artagnan received the money paid to him by mazarin for any future service he might render the cardinal				455.9886845804489
alas said she i did all for the best				2516.170671967145
m noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain				72552.74210355963
arriving there the young woman seemed to hesitate as she had before done in the rue vaugirard				9001.842477188133
you whom i expected last you arrive at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past				2187.9672327992903
i only wait till you give them you will go to buckingham in my behalf and you will tell him i am acquainted with all the preparations he has made but that they give me no uneasiness since at the first step he takes i will ruin the queen will he believe that your eminence is in a position to accomplish the threat thus made yes for i have the proofs i must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation without doubt				1650.7502127235368
is that monsieur said d artagnan to himself				147.0754640649382
but he knows it all now interrupted caderousse they say the dead know everything there was a brief silence the abbé rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his seat				1786.6551665026195
you wish to know what i will do yes i will find him as i told you				32.590293906383735
the falsehood would then lie at my door and as i am not a gentleman i may be allowed to lie be of good heart planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious man				204.31375947256458
that s lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders				732.6619846310678
while the waiter was preparing his room the hostess arose andrea assumed his most charming smile and asked if he could have no				746.0095967189008
suddenly about nine o clock in the evening edmond heard a hollow sound in the wall against which he was lying				17894.449588114458
she has never been so kind before				702.1645283944914
then added in a low whisper you understand that on account of your uncle m policar morrel who served under the other government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of napoleon				24650.1282927962
that is true said d artagnan let us call the others they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis				418.83538637884607
but it was no disgrace to your friend to have been deceived beppo has taken in plenty of others and beppo led him outside the walls said the count				267.19375556626704
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping				14376.67456650467
it was he who gave us so much trouble and kept us on the road so much you gave him three sword wounds in three separate engagements but you know he is now our friend no i didn t know that				355.39436958440615
pale motionless overwhelmed by this frightful revelation dazzled by the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime he ended by falling on his knees before her as the early christians did before those pure and holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace				13271.369624649209
i know not whom look and judge for yourself thank you i understand				1332.9965174925853
so now i have told my secret a telegraph repeated madame de villefort				363.05267694970706
at the same time the door opened a man appeared on the threshold				2885.6444907521113
he sighed and set to work again				309.57308594598965
since i set my foot in france and knew the traitor lived in paris i have watched carefully				30457.72002913436
what else can a strapping chap of twenty one mean with a fine wench of seventeen and you say that dantès has gone to the catalans he went before i came down let us go the same way we will stop at la réserve and we can drink a glass of la malgue whilst we wait for news come along said caderousse but you pay the score of course replied danglars and going quickly to the designated place they called for a bottle of wine and two glasses				27607.755611102224
well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord as we have before said the post chaise was waiting four powerful horses were already pawing the ground with impatience while ali apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the foot of the steps his face bathed in perspiration				4934.456443964286
he consequently sprang up again re entered the office with a turn of his finger set the clock right again that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street				1197.5004612680702
you should not speak so to an old friend like me caderousse as you said just now you are a native of marseilles i am do you know then now what you are no but i was brought up in corsica you are old and obstinate i am young and wilful				23866.24084599346
i do not know replied dantès				196.2974552942988
i thought there were four of you listen to me sir				514.4874771108973
on his return home albert expressed his wish to franz debray and morrel to see them at the opera that evening				774.5832581858073
m de villefort entered his father s room followed by madame de villefort				450.9514104117902
of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow				746.0572654046842
and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion				28059.341162381774
you will speak in italian said he				28.763274663972272
my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one party i am for fresh air				1469.313499888089
old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond				1600.2198561775324
the men are all infamous and i am happy to be able now to do more than detest them i despise them what shall we do asked louise				89916.11178800772
albert followed him with the count				470.56562681526015
they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the letters from the island of elba ought to have informed them franz interrupted himself by saying my father was a royalist they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known and hence said villefort arose my affection for your father my dear m franz				409.1383425632843
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the king s bed ready to die for him laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst d artagnan glided behind the curtains				3965.0114236921704
by heavens exclaimed monte cristo starting back it is ali raised his hatchet				15105.672621560176
look at the arms the sergeant put the lantern near the panel				10010.20125720632
his majesty i can assure you will be tried on his arrival in london i have heard enough from the lips of oliver cromwell to know what to expect a second look was exchanged between athos and aramis				447.0243074686263
without that what would become of me it was one o clock in the morning				1013.6073165090991
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation				7611.910590017521
all at once at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced hats and the waving of feathers she counted two then five then eight horsemen				4048.492593423506
one hour s rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man s bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence seemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future				1701.6902620742103
wait a moment sir said he i have an order for each of you also he turned to a closet where his own orders were locked up and took out two ribbons of the order of the garter				22481.729170280443
at four o clock d artagnan recommenced his journey				2312.6405557701723
some day when the world is much older and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive powers in nature to serve for the general good of humanity when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the secrets of death then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the arms of your beloved and if you wished to die you would choose this death count yes morrel extended his hand				367.751443164676
you can not be mistaken there is but one afterward you will ask for the host and will repeat to him the word forward which means in french en avant				28957.88225538363
yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cæsar spada but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune				2116.6671226551625
i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square				4347.754149847568
really he is by no means a light load said the other bearer sitting on the edge of the hand barrow				32431.258772485347
go away now mouston so he s called mouston thought d artagnan tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about				8868.741320363424
d artagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered mazarin s ante room				492.7870122622854
d artagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between porthos and the procurator s wife and how their comrade was probably by that time in a fair way to be equipped				24459.838987612675
come in my braves said the king come in i am going to scold you the musketeers advanced bowing d artagnan following closely behind them				49.13169317278316
he listened for any sound that might be audible and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the darkness				1327.307794641939
m noirtier yes think you it was the poor servant s life was coveted				23156.38751294004
oh so much the better we will fire the first shot together it is well be friends said the tutor young as you both are you were perhaps born under the same star and were destined to meet				23593.860253130417
the traveler made a sign as if he wished to drink and then pointed to his horse and gesticulated like a man who is brushing something				4818.5228721970025
read the address monsieur el comte de wardes the remembrance of the scene at st germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon				1668.0836519778902
they immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road				2631.4163576077585
are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear child said monte cristo with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy and if any misfortune should happen to me the count stopped				1123.0288420567638
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint				5189.253496898616
soon the fury of the waves and the sight of the sharp rocks announced the approach of death and death then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a sailor to struggle against the wrath of god				727.9826350630335
it was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing				2139.715048371395
he opened the case and offered them to the queen with deep and silent anguish				2064.5381401975333
come said d artagnan to himself i have got one more enemy and now said the queen addressing d artagnan what is to be done				2006.7827588248315
the son has been educated in a college in the south i believe near marseilles				3092.8139661620235
d artagnan as he crossed the pont neuf congratulated himself on having found planchet again for at that time an intelligent servant was essential to him nor was he sorry that through planchet and the situation which he held in rue des lombards a connection with the bourgeoisie might be commenced at that critical period when that class were preparing to make war with the court party				2967.8231326246296
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty and she had signed it				28.03719037492062
tell me mouston said porthos are my arms in good condition your arms my lord what arms zounds				7415.313749793511
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money the host became as pale as death for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master				1658.4711555898443
yes he is young and youth is invariably self confident				15312.211783749872

i have during ten years considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and other wretches like morcerf danglars villefort even morcerf himself must not imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy				1424.0952527962334
now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul				2368.8530027265433
he will do anything i wish				1431.4480339343052
will your eminence please read and examine i am acquainted with it sign it then reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given suppose i refuse then said d artagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal would you dare to touch a cardinal you have dared my lord to imprison her majesty s musketeers the queen will revenge me gentlemen i do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to paris and the parisians will defend us how uneasy they must be at this moment at rueil and saint germain said aramis				21.35746585245736
one day in a moment of despair like yours since it led to a similar resolution i also wished to kill myself one day your father equally desperate wished to kill himself too				2235.0139624546086
you have succeeded the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight				5521.182365192919
that s all that is necessary said athos now for my idea i should like however to comprehend said porthos				17.17425475014083
when the maltese for so they called dantès had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly				14464.001442655186
i have never before been at paris and it is the first time i have ever even set my foot in france ah that is different the house you purchase is at auteuil at these words bertuccio turned pale				703.1341609632345
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said				536.5486314242935
you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here				488.3570092837565
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary				28563.033386521038
the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked franz somewhat incredulously				21830.703050403143
approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world really impossible				1133.2036764945703
it contained half a line in a hand perfectly british and with a conciseness as perfectly spartan thank you be easy				2268.558985405504
i shall try also to help him to down the fronde but on one condition that he sometimes remembers the king s faithful servants and gives the first vacant company of musketeers to a man that i could name				839.5341995990981
still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal distances from one another like sentinels				12866.536853301921
as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists that evening d artagnan went to present his respects to m dessessart and inform him of his promotion				10386.512402476004
shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian				606.8851114602281
my words have not convinced you				29.377511688958652
milady was like a good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat and who is quite prepared according to the chances of the battle to march forward or to beat a retreat				1721.3240260153036
villefort maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the door fixing his eyes on the corpse				1676.2181361634553
as to what you say about not seeing you again i believe not a word of it with such a heart as yours and such a sword one passes through the valley of the shadow of death a dozen times unscathed and unalarmed				18995.281345642215
dantès would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice				535.5420539615035
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so i know too that you are a good marksman there we are about equal				425396.63976445014
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read albert s letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it				178.5118012852253
good it is by my side				861.1345063859616
stay here is another louis for you then that will make only 4 998 louis more said peppino with the same indifference				8403.797297886234
i ask pardon of your eminence said d artagnan but i was so fatigued don t ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service d artagnan admired mazarin s gracious manner				639.5235206651076
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d artagnan and porthos				545.7951431056762
you are not joking are you no on the honor of an officer there is the half pistole and he showed him the seductive coin but did not give it him				116.82291226805032
there was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house				654.0961981928501
an hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms				34445.578586675416
who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamp light a shadow approaching his chief				27097.201754344904
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped but athos cried d artagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty				1536.3479966008763
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill joined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars				203.27891672333075
let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said you removed this stone very carelessly but i suppose you had no tools to aid you why exclaimed dantès with astonishment do you possess any i made myself some and with the exception of a file i have all that are necessary a chisel pincers and lever 0201m oh how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience well in the first place here is my chisel so saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood				68964.41857740356
if your excellencies will please to be seated said the man i will let the count know that you are here and with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried portières				21483.19177962322
the moon is just bursting through the clouds and there standing where you do and wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure you remind me of m de villefort what cried monte cristo it was m de villefort your excellency knows him the former royal attorney at nîmes yes who married the marquis of saint méran s daughter yes who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most rigid magistrate on the bench well monsieur said bertuccio this man with this spotless reputation well was a villain bah replied monte cristo impossible it is as i tell you ah really said monte cristo				6.214793817774311
at that moment d artagnan passed in pursuit of milady he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look				1045.496968849202
but you may use it replied lord wilmore i understand it and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation				2340.184648961807
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m noirtier				1391.7556745349332
i am a sailor not a second was to be lost				1256.6607739673525
his name had been mentioned as a name of terror at the palais royal				3288.900400863713
you at last cried d artagnan				1.6355695669799768
the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house				767.2225886382811
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his				975.1053058751452
read for yourself and judge porthos took the letter and with a trembling voice read the following words the queen wishes to speak to monsieur d artagnan who must follow the bearer well exclaimed porthos i see nothing in that very extraordinary but i see much that is very extraordinary in it replied d artagnan				1.531630054178431
the prince smiled he despised flatterers but he appreciated enthusiasts				237297.39703325997
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand no yes he was				1650.1363584354776
understanding he had nothing more to fear from him caderousse began to go down				727.9135596353755
bazin was their only attendant for grimaud had stayed behind to take care of mousqueton				1152.2560709581808
but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida				41372.3965071628
he found his horse and that of porthos fastened to the manger but to an empty manger				39698.98146476814
we know him said athos he never left the king yes that is he				439.0474971410396
he knew the king of old and he knew that all these complaints were but a preface a sort of excitation to encourage himself and that he had now come to his point at last				2217.899071039143
it is past noon said she and today is saturday i dare say it is the doctor grandpapa noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition				52377.07575225756
oh it is impossible said he i must be dreaming				14304.928039104367
my dear athos cried aramis i think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson god forgive me wait a little aramis it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said aramis				16.79181189357228
the prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the musketeer				1246.6780395146598
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp				1650.7895701447287
we have promised and we will keep our promise				5761.662400468506
my lord said athos we are satisfied we came here only to express our loyalty and to say that we are at your lordship s service and his most faithful servants my most faithful friends gentlemen my most faithful friends you have proved it				74.05694807689154
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career				8839.626407896514
well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good steel				4961.759835472096
i hope my coming will not put you to any inconvenience i reside in my father s house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building quite sufficient replied the count as taking out his tablets he wrote down no				541.1997493044838
on the staircase he met the pretty soubrette who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly				2559.4813745770675
i heard it said that he was marching to the frontier to join the king yes madame but on the frontier he was met by lesly he had tried victory by means of superhuman undertakings				15641.387783185663
oh exclaimed morrel why do they not come				1808.7193224556563
only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes who told you that i had been weeping said she				294.1729506630305
to my grandfather s room i in m noirtier s apartment yes can you mean it valentine i have long wished it he is my only remaining friend and we both need his help come be careful valentine said morrel hesitating to comply with the young girl s wishes i now see my error i acted like a madman in coming in here				664.9263133804241
for three months i watched m de villefort for three months he took not a step out of doors without my following him				16.429221314327467
i thought you would never come in what s the matter now planchet demanded d artagnan				1.7107133962435397
yes said he at length it is so				624.381982745251
haydée said he did you read it oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an hour				1203.6345195886993
yes and who is it said porthos				18.211401837972744
in two days and by using up two or three horses that s nothing i have plenty of money i am at béthune				2634.345334801931
now then let us breakfast with what an air he says all this muttered beauchamp decidedly he is a great man a great man in his own country added debray				303.838837571356
if i obtain the situation i desire i shall owe it to m morrel				324.40072620615405
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace				1900.4585228723104
danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor				1762.4642154705202
he has put out the lamp i can see nothing now get down then and quickly grimaud leaped down				1017.6244419892594
that would carry you to the end of the world				934.7865392645621
i feel if this continues said mme				68.11699164235398
then he added with a certain uneasiness did you meet them why yes i think so in the street said athos and he looked smilingly at aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise				1066.3412526974228
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to paris is he he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling i understand well i am come to ask a favor of you of me yes of you and pray what may it be well to take his part ah my dear sir				388.1139346667043
in one of these risings the duc de beaufort pillaged the house and library of mazarin in order to give the populace as he put it something to gnaw at				9913.904392527289
what said he does not the count know where the house he purchases is situated no returned the count				469.0438578522522
yes my lord apropos what are the names of your friends the count de la fere formerly styled athos monsieur du vallon whom we used to call porthos the chevalier d herblay now the abbé d herblay whom we styled aramis the cardinal smiled				833.9766038007119
he described to him his interview with the cardinal and said for the third time drawing his commission from his pocket you our friend our intelligence our invisible protector accept this commission				5713.412861409785
20185m gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable				3168.1061017249503
it was to this end that he performed from time to time some of those early masses which the common people generally alone attended				21556.006210230422
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their brother				1192.714685135596
yes yes said milady the letter is precise				6658.197797747379
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly				11014.803192449219
the successor of father marteau who makes the excellent pies you know of				2855.58692961509
what blows what blood he fainted				3665.511665590194
ah my dear father said andrea in a loud voice in order that the count might hear him in the next room is it really you how do you do my dear son said the major gravely				6940.062578649323
de chatillon opened his arms and fell back on the crupper of his horse				1050.3579517701241
whilst this scene was going on d artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze				11059.200557192122
you understand baron my grandfather wishes you to read this paper said valentine				210.7691209589691
i was pretty drunk yesterday d artagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous				22563.73724636096
i will be with you directly the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door				277.2721523094373
cloud and not elsewhere before the d estrées s pavilion and not in another street				1169.864145612648
as franz was about to take leave of m de villefort when shall i see you again said the latter				4380.525331760519
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again				450.8095126846986
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you but from whom is that letter oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding grisette from madame de chevreuse s chambermaid perhaps who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress and who in order to appear smart and attractive stole some perfumed paper and sealed her letter with a duchess s coronet what do you say hold				72153.9831920651
they might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks				6094.269016686994
now m de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten months				2232.9218334001303
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him off				831.9081025447558
in the examination which precedes ordination a thesis is always a requisite ordination cried d artagnan who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him and he gazed half stupefied upon the three persons before him				18.86718524961238
see what she writes to me athos said he				24.626153359699337
0255m the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old man s limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open				2399.725572285191
now if i die say to d artagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me				49.87823626710352
scarcely however had they gone a quarter of a league when having killed a kid he begged jacopo to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun				19176.734075572484
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son but villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard				991.8457527991071
it consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of dantès with the passage which united them				356.5984215685853
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial love had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another and economizing their stores and albert had been able to tell his mother without extorting a change of countenance mother we have no more money 50141m mercédès had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous words there is a wide difference				4438.561401163989
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her				110.23062147234212
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that d artagnan heard her in the antechamber				2978.2031050554847
those barrels i saw through the door port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum				2728.8951196054254
indeed does that alarm you no but it agitates me oh				735.4843000644466
he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do				1362.531528693893
porthos and i will stay here the friends obeyed				1139.2316267533827
it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formed it was none of these things that attracted the attention it was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdain these were what fixed the attention of all upon him				11.20365669121239
the four muskets made but one report but four men fell				4496.637295662283
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business				7740.508631882707
athos was calm and grave but aramis was furious the sight of such royal misery exasperated him and his eyes examined every new trace of poverty that presented itself				2627.6698130512395
upon my word you did well to come back nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start it s the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning he sighed heavily				15852.832619120112
danglars was tired and sleepy he therefore went to bed placing his pocketbook under his pillow				6423.511581590449
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier				1485.8586963223704
he waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on				727.6380173908569
sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet he also was dying of hunger				2364.72242905259
i know them cried milady who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart				396.77764124471713
sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies				14176.290597229705
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor for i am aware that m de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me a favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman				1650.1576034231964
everything was conducted in the usual manner				827.0538093330288
my father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire				35015.589664172425
we shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance my good edmond answered the abbé be not deceived				3742.3122717904084
we can not say how long the night seemed to milady but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness				6269.997451150528
m bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired				1320.0033041718723
does monsieur le comte de la fere live here asked planchet				577.0226647237863
the count s tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune				3077.593584653013
when my father with a pistol in his hand was once on the point of committing suicide had anyone then said this man deserves his misery would not that person have been deceived yes but your father was not allowed to fall				10789.526529064153
aramis determined to obtain from the bishop through fear or by persuasion consent that he should enter in the bishop s place and clad in his sacerdotal robes the prison at whitehall				9258.143481492722
bah said danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love				709.8346143102991
what do you prescribe doctor demanded villefort				93.03601171373121
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere				14471.948938592768
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman s word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be so that s porthos all over murmured d artagnan				3.0146314902007934
grimaud thereupon presented himself with his smooth exterior at the donjon of vincennes				2329.2711358475167
they listened he went into his sleeping room and fastened the door inside				4457.9439106130785
m coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted and sighed deeply				5880.30672946268
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak				589.2395557903384
you seek me sir said he				24.90246448780605
i have sent for one replied the abbé				461.2601287154979
all this negotiation must be carried on openly i will follow your eminence s instructions to the letter				660.0236811283407
gentlemen he said this is a serious business and my heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through				6040.646992756877
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him				22.46072538855948
good god asked the poor woman have i said anything that has wounded you no but the name struck me because i also have known that gentleman and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him well oh yes very well not only him but some of his friends messieurs porthos and aramis indeed				869.01774777989
she was an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven				994.6898810097326
on our arrival in paris we shall still have four hundred besides the harnesses said porthos				19.057453163042446
in truth the lieutenant s horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die				732.3958203198756
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently				4003.986835774631
i fear that she has badly sprained her ankle oh heavens cried athos				15.825626161673787
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at d artagnan hatefully				32295.42611847055
don t be a coward or i shall cut off your ears				2936.6015012409794
amuse yourself well replied bonacieux in a sepulchral tone				1029.7239658901515
true i forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants the street of saint honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day				789.3247744323245
i really believe you are a man and a violent one too and you you are a woman a miserable woman stupid and brutal				31235.659171119496
then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his 48 000 francs and the other 50 000 livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon				2041.647610410772
the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries				7344.16147348889
the sailors did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land gaetano sprang to shore exchanged a few words with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came franz				467.60994905694054
you raised the whole district so they told me very nearly replied planchet with a self satisfied air				1306.0190339600454
excuse me mr president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i can not follow you				24.403997994986113
now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but say on but since you go out with haydée and sometimes even take her to the opera well i think i may venture to ask you this favor you may venture to ask me anything well then my dear count present me to your princess i will do so but on two conditions i accept them at once the first is that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the interview very well said albert extending his hand i swear i will not the second is that you will not tell her that your father ever served hers i give you my oath that i will not enough viscount you will remember those two vows will you not				556.4647214161222
because she had been branded continued d artagnan				7.137563627832218
tomorrow perhaps he may change you				33.869271042428515
the field of battle instead therefore of being at saint denis or at charenton will be near compiegne or villars cotterets the prince will vanquish you as he has always done tis possible my lord but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend du vallon who has three				2708.908774469275
let us see with your thousand crowns from the abbey and the twelve thousand francs you make by selling sermons are you rich				4341.7254067110825
the whole world conspires to break our bonds				6253.563344549392
dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces				2928.3165470932063
leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me but you ll die of hunger said the patron				11936.290237658963
dantès told him that the jug had fallen from his hands while he was drinking and the jailer went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken one				791.7856070845106
your excellency said the captain that was the land signal will you answer yourself what signal the captain pointed towards the island up the side of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it rose				5282.763288228701
they were therefore somewhat surprised to meet altogether at the door of the hermitage athos starting out from the pont neuf porthos by the rue de la roule d artagnan by the rue des fosse saint germain l auxerrois and aramis by the rue de bethisy				12259.527702559139
i will give you a paper which you must not part with on any account and which you will deliver into the proper hands and whither am i to go to london i go to london				4691.476614334447
the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the frenchman became somewhat too forward beppo put a brace of pistols to his head the coachman pulled up and did the same				1332.8344436671644
d artagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed				3632.393566701611
when you arrived madame de saint méran had already been panting for breath some minutes she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the bed and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed				3391.7742090061265
as to dantès he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it				34.13121639525552
beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted				4939.428339873826
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him				15.368915746465973
raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive but grimaud did not arrive				3461.3767443286565
remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think that what you are about to do is for his sake yes yes everything for him				14.354992425969236
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spin i feel very keenly fernand that this is charity and if it were mercédès poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of marseilles				1821.2432070709492
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d artagnan				6.002306558166812
my friend exclaimed monte cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness				20013.081747444186
i have if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young man with an air of determination that made his companion shudder				5354.146584314123
but it was so placed on the desk that he could not see to whom it was addressed				2728.1248950753866
there was a moment of silence but at length the two englishmen felt ashamed to draw back and the angrier one descended the five or six steps which led to the cellar and gave a kick against the door enough to split a wall				1196.2591524137097
after a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming vigorously				14714.674388083795
it is done gentlemen said athos				16.79179587966019
during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentine s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted				4852.852006296824
but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy				1763.4780395143487
my worthy cocles said morrel in a tone impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber				3031.582323220081
there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe				4705.618273631444
supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well supposing the assertion to be really true a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father s honor ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit that is precisely the fault of the age and do you undertake to reform it yes as far as i am personally concerned well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow yes i own it are you quite impervious to good advice not when it comes from a friend and do you account me that title certainly i do well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject from whom from haydée why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair what can she do in it she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition you reject this means of information then i do most decidedly then let me offer one more word of advice do so then but let it be the last you do not wish to hear it perhaps on the contrary i request it do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp visit him alone that would be contrary to all custom your case is not an ordinary one and what is your reason for advising me to go alone because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp explain yourself i will do so				182.0611904987671
no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain to every argument they replied we must go for death is in this house they all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially mademoiselle valentine so good so kind and so gentle				19072.391279562566
i will make the journey on purpose to see him if it is worth while at this moment there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp				3313.7663215187104
he rejoined this woman they fled together into berry and there he obtained a little curacy				22731.686733442875
why does he go in secret				1216.1240501703026
the count in taking leave of him said something in a low voice to which he answered willingly count i accept the count returned to young morcerf				734.2778091173697
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt mercédès dress brush past him and his son s warm breath pronouncing these words courage mother				842.4664563781062
i was to have been presented to her when i met her at madame villefort s ball shall i assist you in repairing your negligence asked franz				219.53421610999925
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and d artagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a sensation				7446.743577477043
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti oh do not confound the two eugénie hold your tongue				2212.2957168670696
albert is ten minutes after time there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant how imprudent said château renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat				6778.591527563003
but he does wrong to use his privilege				48870.460137529924
be it so said athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people				1001.9417522499336
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away				978.0814389416613
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected				2661.6095827593153
the sea smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermen s boats white and graceful as the sea gull or the merchant vessels bound for corsica or spain				4688.439656152536
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an hour lest the jailer should change his mind and return he removed his bed took the handle of the saucepan inserted the point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall and employed it as a lever				20422.542771456756
at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived he had seen château renaud who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised				8076.2823095261865
he found buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own hand				510.52581678123715
really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you pray don t mention such a thing said the count				233.84656239497895
but he will not avow it how so because they failed your honor gave me two of these frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for charles i				2016.4785382586638
they have killed them i think and taken flight carrying off their booty				39807.25672373357
now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression				14480.522224681179
but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or man s countenance is no longer to be relied on but morrel albert is your friend simply an acquaintance sir you met on the same day you first saw me yes that is true but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me thank you morrel then ringing the bell once look said he to ali who came immediately take that to my solicitor				25767.31890665113
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place st sulpice or from the rue du vieux colombier to the luxembourg				6316.5948633893095
i want to go into master broussel s house captain replied friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of paris know so well how to assume when necessary				8945.411753806387
she is the prettiest little creature in the world with flaxen hair blue eyes at once saucy and languishing but what say you to raoul s fancy nothing i laugh at raoul but this first desire of the heart is imperious				25878.187223030807
but if i am to believe you sir the people seem to have thrown off all restraint it is a bad year for kings said gondy shaking his head look at england madame yes but fortunately we have no oliver cromwell in france replied the queen				304.4592738626496
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered				5581.5089042181935
the worthy merchant had been more fortunate				15196.644958476501
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans go my dear boy said old dantès and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son his wife said caderousse why how fast you go on father dantès she is not his wife yet as it seems to me no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond				2038.7038225275246
groslow whom d artagnan s praises had greatly pleased welcomed him with a gracious smile				689.825689632516
i took the precaution to half empty the carafe in order that my suspicions might not be noticed				9545.326245307782
they will then fancy it is an ambuscade they will deliberate and by the time they have found out the pleasantry we shall be out of the range of their balls				10139.360636500105
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now noirtier s expression could not be understood				3044.3242694504133
bravery is always respected even in an enemy				1484.4281898435438
oh yes oh yes i do indeed repent and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist				26004.75535337022
fortunately as d artagnan had thought it was not dangerous				6217.953507987136
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart				429.8890306982842
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed d artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her				269.32713652247674
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and i know you well				616.262588616546
the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply				964.6304836968206
his eminence can not see the letter without the bearer of it replied the young man but to convince you that i am really the bearer of a letter see here it is and kindly add continued he that i am not a simple messenger but an envoy extraordinary bernouin re entered the cabinet returning in a few seconds				2393.5772446932037
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance alas said milady i believe so the queen is so good oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with enthusiasm				3237.7902999758835
i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours				1706.0304420321202
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window				1169.9489395591027
yield he cried or you are a dead man the musket fell from the soldier s hands who yielded on the instant				1473.839476482416
villefort had secluded himself not to study but to reflect and with the door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important business he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the events the remembrance of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections				11854.757952939113
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way				723.2900587307943
but i must see him instantly take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother you have kept the secret				1462.8497962743734
then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him what did you refuse to dine with him said old dantès and did he invite you to dine yes my dear father replied edmond smiling at his father s astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son				944.6809432197542
why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth				5582.094458516964
i know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and i am brave also				1702.0716765125628
died poisoned you know by what mistake				7549.448070517063
i should have thought her too reasonable to be led by imagination a problem my dear count for everyone for my mother as well as others much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not fear				1391.5041773899936
but it is not the less true that that letter and planchet retired shaking his head with an air of doubt which the liberality of d artagnan had not entirely effaced				42995.26088807882
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them				51.48941277024725
unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion but what revealed itself				3082.3049624372034
how fine it is to be called condé and to be so worthy of such a name he was calm and radiant was he not as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete				34989.11865441691
most palpable proofs said he as you may perceive you think then that i may rely on the count s promises certainly i do you are sure he will keep his word with me to the letter but at the same time remember we must continue to play our respective parts				5113.78820242478
and you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find persons willing to accept them cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young men				495.1409984907786
you pretend not to know because government was not rich enough ah pardon me said château renaud i have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and i can not understand them yet you will by and by said debray				231.3323186626421
he examined him and found him sound and without blemish				36516.02613881792
i was now safe for i could swim along the ditch without being seen and i reached the canal in safety				1573.244983370725
the magistrate had slept for a short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood				1767.0647221993352
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires to this athos replied quietly we also have money left for i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs				13067.78438914245
he forgot that besides his friends of his own sex a woman strange to say had remembered him				22.531867257568877
monte cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with the look of one equally surprised and displeased				51614.933303014936
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality				9552.338231556936
ah my dear fellow said he to franz you did not see what there that calash filled with roman peasants no well i am convinced they are all charming women how unfortunate that you were masked albert said franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments oh replied he half laughing half serious i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other but in spite of albert s hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants				22437.434431406535
they ask my name i can not give it since my parents abandoned me				64.56223993636016
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the door				246.56392445962746
coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient clerks				12360.606769212713
well gentlemen said the brave captain i hope you have been well amused during your excursion prodigiously replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades				5952.011158707076
in that case we are as well off as we wish and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is about silence porthos said aramis				17.73863551258037
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve nay be not discouraged				27886.368090846147
half past one only said he				26.673559919990694
what a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation what a delicious abbé you would have made oh it s only a temporary postponement replied aramis i shall be one someday				50454.48412035583
the air they breathed was heavy damp and cold				2112.332562432603
on the contrary stay monsieur d artagnan your agreeable company will divert me oh oh thought d artagnan				3.044098980481394
he had not done so for ten years before				657.2884347728072
the child was born was given to me motionless breathless voiceless we thought it dead madame danglars moved rapidly as though she would spring from her chair but villefort stopped and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention				905.9955076021653
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saint méran arose from her pillow				6262.593181937925

he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated 10th april 1815 in which morrel by the deputy procureur s advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort s certificates rendered indisputable				32892.47111953833
he did not wear the uniform cloak which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence but a cerulean blue doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water ripples in the sun				6710.5274835940445

ah said the king we shall soon see whether my highlanders have betrayed me or not what are you going to do exclaimed athos				39.30730274866118
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force				2515.242195272314
ah pardieu he exclaimed that would be fair play and approaching the carriage he examined the arms on the panels and the livery of the coachman on his box				1339.2631825284502
again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve				27564.688979093462
i grasped it in my hand put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the fire itself and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the fire nearly one third of the paper had been consumed by the flame				10332.914646558604
my friend monsieur du vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day				703.2458182327334

he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest i strike you behind strike me said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt				1054.4699421794276

franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself				444.64436384253696
he found d artagnan waiting for him already at his post in the ante room				482.4601537672929
a gentleman in his opinion and according to d artagnan s portrait of him the stranger must be a gentleman would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter				774.9752377679116
however he added turning to porthos i should not regret dying sir were i sure that by doing so i might still be useful to you mouston replied porthos much affected should we ever see my castle of pierrefonds again you shall have as your own and for your descendants the vineyard that surrounds the farm and you should call it devotion added aramis the vineyard of self sacrifice to transmit to latest ages the recollection of your devotion to your master chevalier said d artagnan laughing you could eat a piece of mouston couldn t you especially after two or three days of fasting oh no replied aramis i should much prefer blaisois we haven t known him so long one may readily conceive that during these jokes which were intended chiefly to divert athos from the scene which had just taken place the servants with the exception of grimaud were not silent				1405.5315711376738
but it is your own fault				10172.659444827155
then she grasped the front hair which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the contrary her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows				15840.923764227993
confound it cried the gascon trying in vain too late to retract the thrust				6081.78613066095

the officer alone went on board where he was received with all the deference inspired by the uniform				10437.97892411687
and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this mazarin would have you hanged do you think so i am sure of it then i would kill him rather than let him go and you would act rightly				10155.27000594099

but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance				5587.585686287546

as a further precaution they had bound his hands				301.25361941540893
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort s for the purpose of returning the procureur s visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion				6348.421118104865
thank you monseigneur he said drawing back i am paid the duke went from one surprise to another				487.6417012138384

d artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp beds				17802.73662875465
it may be imagined that d artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramis s ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement chevalier he said get up and don t make the least noise aramis awoke				65476.091895624915
then i confess to you that i have eaten nothing since ten o clock this morning and i am devilish hungry we will dine directly my friend only you must please to remember that this is friday				25211.09185227745
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever				2626.64633543993

the queen reflected for a moment and then seeing the cautious demeanor of the musketeer perhaps you like repose she said				500.8215964608697

he did not speak but showed the paper to dantès				312.49318253349
it vexes me greatly continued athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for i am not yet at the end of my story what else have you done after having lost my own horse nine against ten see how near i formed an idea of staking yours yes but you stopped at the idea i hope no for i put it in execution that very minute and the consequence said d artagnan in great anxiety				1251.3557009493748
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor				1881.9771206681733
you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions				1868.1953589330558
he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette				34047.81454418629
every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine o clock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest s breviary				28032.701381301034

at the foot of the staircase de winter stopped				1616.3003909078984
the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling costume				3852.965816216418
i think he is either a dull provincial person or a spy in search of information and you replied to him with that notion nothing warranted me to answer him otherwise he was polite to me and i was so to him but if he be a spy what do you think a spy would be about here				481.9166103262569
d artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen				1620.8408556583938
the two gentlemen were exasperated they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and thirst				31535.662301434037
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another				872.5704248715767
but what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old servant true said m d avrigny we will return the doctor went out first followed by m de villefort				182.060061926236
from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the fête exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight				5489.5649440185425
the general who had almost fainted revived				80076.8374215368
pay him booby cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his master				1678.3615841412184
you would have done what i did mordaunt wanted now only two or three fathoms to reach the boat for the approach of death seemed to give him supernatural strength				4053.2829951488366
speak speak said valentine i entreat you has your resolution changed valentine it can not change unhappy man you know it must not cried the young girl				928.2667960068854

i live retired in the house of my noble protector but i do it from choice				75228.81420645685
i see her now as on her knees at my feet with her head thrown back she begged for life				360.70813925938995
no its odor charms one of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it				23.464960826483107
you touch them come in contact with them speak to them and they reply to you ah said villefort smiling i confess i should like to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me you have been served as you desire monsieur for you were warned just now and i now again warn you then you yourself are one of these marked beings yes monsieur i believe so for until now no man has found himself in a position similar to mine				1110.9045989068507
go to bed planchet and sleep soundly my faith monsieur				977.6804295767332
ah believe me edmond as i told you i too have suffered much i repeat it is melancholy to pass one s life without having one joy to recall without preserving a single hope but that proves that all is not yet over				1671.4914584963715
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl				1539.913970594474
a friend of ten years standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy come observed the countess smiling i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the appearance of lara in order to avoid being confounded with m de rothschild and you have seen her her 20183m the beautiful greek of yesterday no we heard i think the sound of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible when you say invisible interrupted albert it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains where was this window with white hangings asked the countess				2895.3117894391944
but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight no no by no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground				989.8849555474407
you are right and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos				14.403492236284597
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him				15.201097019446747
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead				798.9703691567859
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose				2336.3703114764976
my dear m debray said the banker do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of madame danglars for you can hear them as well tomorrow but i claim tonight and will devote it if you will allow me to talk over some serious matters with my wife this time the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that lucien and the baroness were staggered and they interrogated each other with their eyes as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible will of the master of the house prevailed and the husband was victorious				21957.88292444293
i entreat you to write to me for you form a part of my existence and if i may venture to tell you so i also feel anxious				44270.64971647056
i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much and i hate her said château renaud				911.6456294852732
long live the coadjutor cried the crowd				3040.917709822219
every one according to his nature my dear d artagnan				4.495225154271
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel				5213.654116743159
as to the key it had disappeared				413.6328057786219
to which the others had responded that they would be glad to see the gallows erected they would serve for the hanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the price of the people s misery				13122.45888029432
it might have been thought that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil				25163.219322319143
well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears i see that i am condemned to die no valentine for i have foreseen all their plots no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live valentine live to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart but to insure this you must rely on me command me sir what am i to do you must blindly take what i give you alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die you must not confide in anyone not even in your father my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked valentine clasping her hands				321.01480257992387
la carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so come in dear m joannes ma foi said the jeweller drenched with rain i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight				9760.101163182486
useless to look everything will come to us when wanted				4941.902027205191
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups				29388.891441333108
madame said he with dignity there will shortly be a ball at the hôtel de ville				39645.105559465155
this evening sir he replied all will be ready chapter xlvi				24211.604597982205
with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud				99914.65089576953
all took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what boileau calls the style énergique commented on the feverish agitation of andrea on m danglars riveted attention eugénie s composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair				1661.1843057066487
on the contrary one shot at this moment would be paid for dearly to morrow comminges took his four guards and as many musketeers and ran to the carriage from which he made the people inside dismount and brought them to the vehicle which had upset				30463.12320296795
to the huguenots as places of safety there only remained la rochelle				4108.1352222061205
pray d artagnan said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that i shall have no head to converse with you				51.646416593002385
bravo bravo said franz things go wonderfully				222633.45820703259
still further buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english imperial and spanish armies				32283.508981515286
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead				1892.9238694113203
pistoles have no name young man and that ring has a terrible one which may betray him who wears it sell this ring a ring which comes from my sovereign				27123.262919287725
at the sight of papers of all sorts titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i found nothing				352.2715384141154
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle very well said d artagnan his eyes aflame battle				2185.402209473758
come come give it to me				48.850255708354574
at length milady could hold out no longer she broke the silence				868.0416028799185
now sir said madame de villefort i must bid you farewell				12717.946999258706
go oh count you overwhelm me with that coolness				2907.5364376962266
this child for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor s orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my garden				1116.3741416277176
there is but one favor i would entreat of you speak guard carefully the secret of your birth				12813.515199468071
that is right i recommend the cardinal to your attention make your mind easy he is in good hands planchet went out the curate remaining for a moment				1360.1290885443068
this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy				19852.79424563455
so edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide marks were				3148.281916626159
m de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing				842.0046058129163
how is that you asked me for five hundred men did you not				586.1125237702391
the cardinal reached a second door without perceiving he was being followed the sand with which the alleys were covered deadened the sound of footsteps				2290.3888787824135
oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court				890.971661838813
although i had eaten nothing since the evening before my fears prevented my feeling hunger				2140.192600015513

valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away				772.0422438137202
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body				1132.2579121886604
has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands				349.2359260675472
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words				677.3851207959774
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten				33582.69827807158
raoul delighted at the count s companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay				19408.168741215795
guides are useful people who will turn their hands to anything				3032.918325214334
the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands				446.2678117904206
just reflect a little what an agitation the queen s mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years it is true said porthos				16.000690597006408
pushed from him violently the table at which he was sitting				14696.386720455099
there grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit père lachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous				21117.777143597206
bertuccio cried he striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong				4592.923173860703
i knew very well that they tired out their executioners but i did not believe them so strong against their lovers alas				4765.9065490113535
i am rejoiced to hear you speak of monsieur d emery as calculated for a post which requires a man of probity				46520.67208861782
last of all came the governor				2365.930383710229
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together				957.5893029167107
he will be delivered to the parliament members of which can of course be bought but even monsieur de mazarin is not rich enough to buy the whole body i think returned anne of austria fixing upon him a glance which in any woman s face would have expressed disdain but in a queen s spread terror to those she looked upon nay i perceive you dare to threaten the mother of your sovereign madame replied d artagnan i threaten simply and solely because i am obliged to do so				196.67212648679265
madame danglars uttered a scream and fainted				3695.1133236856176
many small donations 1 to 5 000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs				16350.176023990383
these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union				13041.564891889933
do you understand me perfectly you pledge me for three millions do you not the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an idea of your value thank you				34.82008109999048
my vocation commands me it carries me away d artagnan smiled but made no answer				1232.6750557124533
but first barricade the first door well then we will follow yonder cavalier the two friends set to work and crowded the space before the door with all the furniture in the room as not only to make the passage impassable but so to block the door that by no means could it open inward				351953.5689506936
hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough a violent convulsion attacked the old man				337.00232082412464
you do not understand asked felton				346.1011889496078
this was the chief of the band luigi vampa				2238.00428964844
your friend s soul must stick tight to his body were you there then monsieur i followed them from curiosity so that i saw the combat without the combatants seeing me and what took place oh				689.3383808758224
but his confidence in grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance				57748.62333436264
he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them				65.39854630851575
he entered by the faubourg st jacques under verdant arches				61878.58394092838
dantès redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods				19425.538018460138
the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase				1423.7231756912045
at length the hour drew near				4915.940752199885
but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was non capisco 50241m danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting house				630.3148423252557
as to the details the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the affairs of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the subject				1278.1812829428243
you are disputing which shall fight me first but you do not consult me who am most concerned in the matter				1305.5968720068765
you are always right said the music teacher seating herself by the side of her friend				652.5018536935962
the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains				3886.096881793318
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonder for whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that richelieu was great i will not contradict you there said d artagnan				1.4816284342711479
but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again ah you are only one and twenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it				64.39986531641122
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand				368.27841910602933
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key i open the abyss				6791.8698105768535
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on				620.184191906805
the donjon of vincennes was considered very unhealthy and madame de rambouillet had said that the room in which the marechal ornano and the grand prior de vendome had died was worth its weight in arsenic a bon mot which had great success				15630.457597042612
at one end was the receipted bill for the 287 000 francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel nut with these words on a small slip of parchment julie s dowry				33261.476730892304
i saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses i heard my glass removed the same which is there now on the table oh dear mother it was a dream so little was it a dream that i stretched my hand towards the bell but when i did so the shade disappeared my maid then entered with a light but she saw no one phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them				62.05619302748223
we went to take monsieur athos to the waters of forges where my friends still remain and you have returned have you not replied m bonacieux giving to his countenance a most sly air				1330.07395668833
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed				1840.7951776352973
the count of san felice pointed out teresa who was hanging on luigi s arm in a group of peasants				22719.63661252257
in case i should be killed said de guiche				3527.5969035510307
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st				8760.50343241938
tell me quickly my time is not my own monsieur said d artagnan on quitting tarbes and coming hither it was my intention to request of you in remembrance of the friendship which you have not forgotten the uniform of a musketeer but after all that i have seen during the last two hours i comprehend that such a favor is enormous and tremble lest i should not merit it it is indeed a favor young man replied m de tréville but it may not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe or rather as you appear to believe				8067.368151022965
i suppose you have no more money and that they will be welcome i have still twenty pistoles sir well take them that makes seventy and if you wish for more said porthos putting his hand to his pocket thank you sir replied raoul blushing thank you a thousand times at this moment olivain appeared				1776.3390613765785
go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have no need of your service				1055.754398927797
ah my dear fellow excuse me i am lodged like a chartreux				41718.68128552054
i do not understand italian yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant s shoulder				894.1262094464796
so from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the cellar				3421.1809889937317
faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell				3058.2745256378266
and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes				588.7121278513895
the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles with directions from dantès to join him at the island of monte cristo				23.159631815730602
they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette				9459.769311404985
london is far from paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers what matters it if you avoid them hold madame bonacieux said the mercer hold				8056.58887304024
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent				9018.80488496165
well now you understand mother continued albert here are more than 4 000 francs settled on you upon these you can live at least two years do you think so said mercédès				1077.090763093459
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker				1632.421083416827
well replied milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of impossibilities do not overwhelm me with happiness cried d artagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him				64.91359509250813
dandré is not a man to be accused of treason				2798.7462883642334
or rather to observe the chronological order i and d artagnan replied athos				17.17882090451702
in the midst of this chamber were four stones which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them				354.36923051497337
there is a carriage coming said château renaud				879.4916603576123
he committed a crime it is true but he repented of it and the four friends quit the room leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont				64482.56044000133
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publisher s office				1978.5307942246025
you were going to visit monsieur de la fere said d artagnan				1.475262143439092

vampa approached the corpse and recognized cucumetto				4750.514402081935
d artagnan cast an inquiring glance at milady				240.66549318330064
i can not now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it poor father murmured the priest				3798.8605145622755

my dear athos you view things on the dark side methinks my dear fellow i mistrust women				1731.1596544994147
what could be the good of that				539.1473955183769
do you take any interest in politics a gleam of light shone in aramis s eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by d artagnan				6.950611632742396
there s what you want on that table said the waiter				12034.222198649692
when he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped				1554.864965496467
a few minutes after twelve o clock bernouin knocked at the queen s bedroom door having come by the cardinal s secret corridor				16288.187933791321
on guard but said he whom d artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st germain or in the pré aux clercs what you say is full of sense replied d artagnan but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely				14598.952563053375
whom the man we are seeking it seems said d artagnan that whilst i thought i was coming to noisy i have entered without suspecting it into the kingdom of mysteries come replied the same lofty tone answer				1229.8416653689087
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed				3124.7084207003804
you don t imagine he would consider a little thing like that at any rate said porthos i am glad to hear d artagnan admit that he is afraid i not only confess it but am proud of it returned the gascon i m not such a rhinoceros as you are				1515.6393813570867
that knife was for you my lad she would have killed you				26.46241342077122
then the king who without our suspecting it had overheard our conversation interrupted us by saying villefort observe that the king did not pronounce the word noirtier but on the contrary placed considerable emphasis on that of villefort villefort said his majesty is a young man of great judgment and discretion who will be sure to make a figure in his profession i like him much and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son in law of the marquis and marquise de saint méran				4624.877530378362
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees				2847.7437235742823
the police had orders to make the strictest search for the murderer				8551.44792884659
edmond said she and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who appealed to you with every chance against her alas i am grown old with grief more than with years and can not now remind my edmond by a smile or by a look of that mercédès whom he once spent so many hours in contemplating				32249.567723541477
in a moment you didn t forget my purse no be easy good porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post				2652.4139821217877
thanks to the influence of m morrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed				3572.2268318903293
he drew portraits with a piece of coal of the cardinal and as his talents did not enable him to produce a very good likeness he wrote under the picture that there might be little doubt regarding the original portrait of the illustrious coxcomb mazarin monsieur de chavigny the governor of vincennes waited upon the duke to request that he would amuse himself in some other way or that at all events if he drew likenesses he would not put mottoes underneath them				94.26232084863179
d artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus and stooped to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines but at this moment two shots were fired				2560.0721433653302
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty				2767.242808851863
he was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim at on a little iron plate which served him as a target when his study door opened and baptistin entered				801.2610430890313
and now gentlemen he continued turning towards m de blacas and the minister of police i have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war fortunately sire said m de blacas we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment do not mention reports duke to me for i know now what confidence to place in them				153.7308670325971

look at it said the abbé with a smile				702.7848854657408
i say two because in such circumstances monsieur du vallon who is rich always gives me his prisoners mordaunt completely deceived by the wordy civility of d artagnan smiled like a man who understands perfectly the reasons given him and said i shall have the order signed directly sir and with it two thousand pistoles meanwhile let me take these men away no replied d artagnan what signifies a delay of half an hour				1217.6954150966787
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling the queen s eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away				776.7477133503843
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch patrol				24257.227159261507
one day when he arrived with his head in the air and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold he found the soubrette under the gateway of the hôtel but this time the pretty kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed she took him gently by the hand				520.8627067656712

i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity				26753.710257171188

just then the sound of finger nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed valentine that the count was still watching and recommended her to do the same at the same time on the opposite side that is towards edward s room valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated the lock turned and the door slowly opened				1369.6885763549747

despite the weight of two bodies the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air				1580.9139672100034
i will proclaim the violence you have used toward me				36.37594967662724

at the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to us in the same box with the lovely greek girl				1526.7264068125057
in 43 he said just before the death of the late cardinal i received a letter from athos				87.67005214719262
then outrages were heaped upon me and as my soul was not subdued they wished to defile my body forever				2455.246861416146
he was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living				3189.761218114745
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done				1886.2346919317133

my dear friend said the cardinal leaning as they walked through the garden on his friend s arm you told me just now that you had been twenty years in the queen s service yes it s true				984.9440137460612
pay and eat and what am i to pay with brute said danglars enraged				19416.99957701999
he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking				13637.1585038997
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation and in noirtier s name gave that order				1908.1760227723296
the first glance which maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first words she spoke made his heart bound with delight				3197.4759015313757
how do you take it inquired the unknown in the french or turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling				22318.286843828435
what a devil of a face you have porthos				329.3974422360165
look that is right replied the mendicant dismiss your lackey in fact bazin curious to know what the mendicant could want with his master kept pace with him as well as he could and arrived almost at the same time he did but his quickness was not of much use to him				36.23447884593516
at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder				977.7722741789262
why this woman was a monster				9065.620818103374
but there is nothing which would do nothing 40114m oh sir cried barrois are you going to let me die without help				3552.3190092957466
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought in what way was the escape to be effected				26516.692222500482
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance				3232.39424373232
he approached her and said in a low voice has your majesty still confidence in me this voice startled her				64.6732560614542
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude				42742.72696614441
i will await you at the corner of the rue du musée and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me then emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation yes				815.5931141694729
good god added the wounded man in an accent of terror which made the young men shudder you will not allow that				325.7314301245476
are there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness why we can not tell				5889.774866903416
if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them said monte cristo				6.048750101828842
aramis in a black gown his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap not much unlike a calotte was seated before an oblong table covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio				44101.29317784337
without reckoning added monte cristo that he is on the eve of entering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in france yes yes i know what you mean the railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not precisely it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that affair ten millions				1834.8745759386566
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter he opened a drawer and took out a purse				2537.4063216142413
come come tell me i am dying with curiosity and uneasiness athos said d artagnan getting rid of his female garments and appearing in his shirt prepare yourself to hear an incredible an unheard of story well but put on this dressing gown first said the musketeer to his friend				592.9021138316971
athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to grimaud s ear				1153.2080915323852

so much the worse sir said anne of austria so much the worse at least for the queen for to day she has need of the same courage and the same devotion what exclaimed d artagnan does the queen surrounded as she is by such devoted servants such wise counselors men in short so great by merit or position does she deign to cast her eyes on an obscure soldier anne understood this covert reproach and was more moved than irritated by it				84.07263740228387
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid her monte cristo started				2309.0351614355936
everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently				37043.66527024168
shivering for want of a fagot				17227.13420296464
yes my lord how much were they worth why said porthos that was very good of him it seems to me a thousand pistoles i said a thousand pistoles porthos exclaimed				2000.2386284757856
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmond s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts thanks danglars that will smooth over all difficulties				14081.915112323699
at least keep him there till my daughter be married impossible madame justice has its formalities what even for me said the baroness half jesting half in earnest				12178.052003993742
only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos thank god the queen is still of an age to give one they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning				1486.0436296286048
all these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was concerned				8017.330654220163
i am commissioned to seize your person sir said comminges in the same tone and with the same politeness and if you will believe me you had better spare yourself the trouble of reading that long letter and follow me a thunderbolt falling in the midst of these good people so peacefully assembled there would not have produced a more appalling effect				3210.412953566661
at a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade				6484.8104348050665
bazin cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the hôtel each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lackey				3181.4552412795815
mercédès read albert while showing you that i have discovered your plans i hope also to convince you of my delicacy				18269.029572180058
yes said danglars taking it from beyond his reach and as what i say and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if anything happened to dantès the worthy dantès look here and taking the letter he squeezed it up in his hands and threw it into a corner of the arbor				6242.587552602342

the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death				349.91852717999836
madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road in fact the procession arrived in safety at notre dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a te deum				18286.65242051512
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected				4085.038225370227
battles long journeys blows given and received sufficed for the first themes of conversation which turned upon the silent struggles sustained against him who was now called the great cardinal				610.386026331594
the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out 700 000 francs in the course of an hour i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face				804.1462768127652
you have not returned that visit and you were wrong monseigneur i feared i had incurred disgrace with your eminence how could that be monsieur				1175.8084215510971
no monsieur jester replied d artagnan but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of god amen said d artagnan getting into his saddle				3001.5628727653493
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet d artagnan				3.7283722046382275
edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from time to time his cheeks flushed his brow darkened and a mist passed over his eyes				657.4351314897018
we will divide our regiments into two squadrons				49635.08740406949
an instant later the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs steps drew near the door opened and a man appeared				1701.0509760176753
i have seen him once replied grimaud a cloud darkening his countenance at the picture so suddenly summoned to the bar of recollection				6125.886379292159
poisons act particularly on some organ or another one on the stomach another on the brain another on the intestines				36205.70869166124
my son i bless thee the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old man s bed				1005.1071445162476
to your eminence murmured bonacieux rolling his eyes round in astonishment				782.5714737384607
i tried to open the door but it was locked inside then i called the sergeant and here i am said the sergeant				2285.7018368227323
none of this had escaped the count and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer				40246.84995603688
they were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with eyes of fascination smiles of love and bright and flowing hair				2970.7100640998515
doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath				47909.225774609986
thus did athos and aramis make their appearance in the ante chamber where about a dozen noblemen were collected in waiting				8223.062853510037
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and terror and without a word i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a horse s tail and thus they took me to nîmes				66200.59923028803
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france i am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint jacques				11789.310400142529
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another				641.8627798134834
lord winter you are not the king you are my uncle at the same moment mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at winter it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of athos murmuring he is avenged think of my mother shouted mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop				2202.2022753871233
danglars looked radiant with joy the banker accompanied him to the door				254.8462395964911
as the day advanced the tumult became greater				34000.4729897857
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium				2729.5080718121208
albert turned away his head with a sigh and went to his own apartments				3113.6545093069803
an apartment as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to signor pastrini s hotel				2035.2304487748702
his family will care much about such a trifle as that				765.0157277934065
the eight guards were at their posts				5631.1948468413275
there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his death bed the father of so dangerous a bonapartist as dantès was stigmatized as a crime				2044.9369061672508
here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose they are compounded doubly strong monte cristo opened the tortoise shell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition				28909.952298168348
the woman must have once been handsome but traces of sorrow have aged her				144.88864760961494
the valet then left the room				339.6682992892286
but d artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips				675.0702510028658
the overture to the second act began and at the first sound of the leader s bow across his violin franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl who turned around to say a few words to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on				770.1097309256614
i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan				3299.5819443796
this letter is not in your table nor in your secretary and yet this letter must be somewhere would you dare to lift your hand to your queen said anne of austria drawing herself up to her full height and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening				7802.847684560096
someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains				3877.8965991407035
the enemy was marching upon lens with the intention doubtless of securing possession of that town and separating from france the army of france				693.3919744500206

the young girl hastily took the letter from him				30.537314608377024
you do not know your own good fortune and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied morcerf with a slight degree of irony in his voice if you did nothing				403.24031509154463
tell us news of yourself as often as you can that is to say as often as you can with safety				1649.3347567870844

pah but where is your wicker flask monsieur mousqueton				871.417829652516
porthos was ruminating over an excellent dinner he had just demolished				14943.275493406732
but while we are speaking of business danglars added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the subject tell me what i am to do for m cavalcanti give him money if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good excellent he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40 000 francs payable at sight on you signed by busoni and returned by you to me with your endorsement of course i immediately counted him over the forty bank notes monte cristo nodded his head in token of assent				1749.0413224060385
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place				778.795658739618
so much the better so much the better				895.6269495895566
30175m yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning				1313.8136036956168

at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome				1053.3105962636773
monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively				5781.587767874921
as they stopped at the door of the cardinal s study d artagnan was about to be announced when rochefort slapped him on his shoulder				878.7107129570246
he also morrel like you considered himself the unhappiest of men well asked morrel				104.94487688463754
come he said if i pay you the 100 000 francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease certainly said peppino				3913.1858802033366
if anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which madame de villefort approached the bed and looked fixedly on valentine				433.02152141728806
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures				18761.30767571056

it is well known how violent the king s prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men				762.1422316442292
fifty cavaliers cried the gascon and porthos				445.3437409476711

felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration				4894.515591496069
he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the traveler s abandoning his purse to save his life				478.8576674472866
he tore himself from the arms of porthos and aramis and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress				1444.448882219715
everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow				77755.82113983514
the duchess was the first to speak				660.3419436149804

vampa then rushed towards teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed				2751.527207194079

morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him				43.74475898123723

merciful goodness whispered aramis to athos did you see what asked athos				15.76304468998485

franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained				16289.07337456725
what a pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead				927.0870465106392
but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort why not because i scarcely know why but it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it is it so				618.825634227921
compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible				7044.392990756471

gentlemen good morning as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage bravo said beauchamp to albert i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m danglars for heaven s sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere				7124.969887474798
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself				521.0885210250175

albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the papers looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth powder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading papers of paris muttering these papers become more and more stupid every day a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m lucien debray				958.0405439935953
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind and you albert i replied the viscount i saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything				494.5194971873601

curiosity prevailed over prudence and profiting by the preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have plunged the two personages now on the scene he stole from his hiding place and quick as lightning but stepping with utmost caution he ran and placed himself close to the angle of the wall from which his eye could pierce the interior of aramis s room				333.3961481743839
the whole population was on foot drums were beating in the streets and in the port the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea				2318.9657588257974

all was useless the treasure disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off				906.8331344547456
he found the duke reclining upon a sofa with his hand pressed upon the wound				3903.6066285844313
d artagnan knelt down near the thickest part of the hedge				14544.033822845995

he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars née hermine de servieux albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friend s conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the count s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess				5681.095530959692

the closet into which d artagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see				1210.2142679417739

d artagnan offered his friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient				15500.894801893717
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain and the count de guiche follow urban and planchet and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest				3017.1581452190476

act prudently oh do not fear besides you will accompany me				33.21028418081612
the prisoners therefore had remained silent as they marched along in company with their conquerors which they could do with the less difficulty since each of them had occupation enough in answering his own thoughts				1093.7285562070497
bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead				860.0950314482126

your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole monsieur d artagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment				892.1220436178921
d artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver				5005.208018030442
13 paris now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address noirtier repeated the abbé noirtier i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria a noirtier who had been a girondin during the revolution				10237.359261464055

the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time				623.5331407685397

she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you				24.680623149208188
well said d artagnan one is never killed in a first engagement nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killed well he will die bravely but hold should such a misfortune happen well athos passed his hand across his pale brow				853.850277536945
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a volcano an extinct volcano before the days when remus and romulus had deserted alba to come and found the city of rome				1174.193682848562
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate				2436.580280881475

a vision at four o clock the four friends were all assembled with athos				367.97333738578567

the stranger was about to reply but at the moment he opened his mouth d artagnan who had heard all precipitated himself over the threshold of the door				295.704492229534
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head				625.9037383104686
no thank you d artagnan trembled lest planchet seduced like the crow in the fable should tell his name and that the queen knowing his name would discover that planchet had belonged to him				19.37360885780834
he had assigned himself the task of saving a man s life that day chance caused that man to be myself				767.0561493856512
we traversed greece and arrived half dead at the imperial gates				6997.42311323547
on my part i will go out with my hands in my pockets that nothing may be suspected				15407.307648576989
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind				726.3834344306599

yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge a slight shade passed over the brow of bonacieux but so slight that d artagnan did not perceive it				20.508329241598272
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far				5640.681453903431
stop in the name of heaven monsieur porthos cried she				326.77202993422657
escape as lord de winter had thought milady s wound was not dangerous				6267.767481043261
the blood mounted to his temples his eyes became dim he saw from what fountainhead the ferocious hopes of the young man arose and he put his hand to the hilt of his sword				826.0586243414833

the cardinalists were three the musketeers lackeys included were seven				3406.8909594545185
dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend				630.7309512470127
as for the duc de beaufort he arrived from vendome according to the annals of the day bringing with him his high bearing and his long and beautiful hair qualifications which gained him the sovereignty of the marketplaces				32324.60624775606
dantès sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him				15.860169018143738
i stand in need of being taught and consoled consoled for what for my misfortune your misfortune is laughable said athos shrugging his shoulders i should like to know what you would say if i were to relate to you a real tale of love which has happened to you or one of my friends what matters tell it athos tell it better if i drink drink and relate then not a bad idea said athos emptying and refilling his glass				1207.6731922351619
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain oh it is terrible and m de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father				873.0049142687275
five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage entered				786.1323992032752
do you know what has become of athos asked d artagnan of planchet as they galloped on				612.5158885102446
it was her first and on what an occasion				3006.8947403089724
my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm				2730.2669697910833
franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read 40038m extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques held february 5th 1815 franz stopped				1594.5209308696267
diable resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel i confess i prefer the convent of noisy athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward de winter				553.0267221347874
the same impression was experienced by all present and no one was deceived by the expression of his countenance				778.9182167558831
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me i do better than that sir i save you you do				1550.7999071664544
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and i come back still more weary and low spirited that s all				316.6615319293169
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on				1129.1308030929888
d artagnan and porthos pointed to their dusty and torn dresses but the cardinal shook his head				357.8746348439441
the name of d artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year 1634 or 1635 that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty				32832.86192136464
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it				109.22916066417284
there are hours which last a year				2801.893582119091
athos followed the footman who led him through a long succession of apartments and paused at length before a closed door				227.534176432708
i don t suppose that our friend d artagnan has added any of his own to the amount but gentlemen in all this said d artagnan we do not think of the queen				389.8636051149531
the door opened but before it could be closed the lady exclaimed oh lucien oh my friend the concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger s name was lucien still as he was the very perfection of a door keeper he made up his mind not to tell his wife				845.0220457609762
he turned back a door partly open enabled him to see his road and to hear the voice of one in sorrow				4800.487981850863
no longer could edmond look into those wide open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed				50864.17188751913
these leaders had corn in abundance and would not let them partake of it they adopted as a maxim for they too had maxims that it was of very little consequence that women children and old men should die so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy				27951.094353130386
i attach great importance to the question i am about to put to you				48.13236274208668
30 in the avenue des champs élysées				4107.633771462501
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own				983.8672075604975
50195m he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted and entered noirtier s room				444.15189541508585
are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred				14914.473476466314
i scarcely thought you were so curious as that i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies and he was not among the least of them				262.6239226167761
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states				2279.0489328612484
d artagnan i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you aramis does the same to porthos now hate me if you can but for my own part i shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you				45.52120115490087
is it absolutely necessary then to send the money to luigi vampa asked the young man looking fixedly in his turn at the count				452.35213901334254
this as you know is the important point of distinction between the covenanter and the cavalier after some discussion this was agreed to and mousqueton played the role of barber				23888.625026880258
god sends me this and i hail it joyfully how strong and courageous you are said the fair frail girl to her brunette companion				2105.7896220729144
we have only the vulture to deal with				1628.9841828153046
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of henry iv when shall we two walk together athos then said to aramis				88.77456660232708
my word as a gentleman never to say anything of you never to do anything against you on your side a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me				47.59937693880771
he was now as we have said three and thirty years of age and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance				1474.1810678353859
sick of the smallpox at his age				1527.6024419077812
he had a deep set penetrating eye almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast				1457.7568665582535
their three graves were there rising above the ground and a fourth was also there yawning for its ghastly tenant				9182.951540398873
you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali				5098.439330742377

with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties				25045.141482008396
i buy those horses he said to the groom				32594.446547447827
just as ordinarily faces are colored by blood his face seemed dyed by hatred and became livid				11242.896210771187
what can i do for the son				993.0979654145121
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me alas alas what a fearful extremity valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother i would rather die a hundred times oh yes die no you will not die but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope i will think of maximilian you are my own darling child valentine				578.35480540066
here i am ready to give you any explanation you desire why said danglars in the letter i believe i have it about me here he felt in his breast pocket yes here it is				1229.6475709647987
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation				16735.100107992148
from twelve to two o clock danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker				2576.826418483266
have you not let it go out of your hands no d avrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them				119.45929356001353
edmond and mercédès were clasped in each other s arms				553.041226027959
the catacombs of saint sebastian in his whole life perhaps franz had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this moment				1223.371025886044
i will offer six millions and i will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty on my word said the inspector in a low tone had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad i should believe what he says i am not mad replied faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners				9436.351365306575
then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword				1113.993448214108
she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world				994.7610293185872
the jailer was right dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad				2915.474812621409
i am not a priest you are not a priest cried the executioner				2091.080688014321
by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given d artagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared				498.91237400861945
at the very moment when the queen quitted the convent to go to the palais royal a young man dismounted at the gate of this royal abode and announced to the guards that he had something of importance to communicate to cardinal mazarin				618.2310406875918
monsieur d artagnan made a compact with you and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond reach m				335.46509168663613
i uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child				1387.508893006863
that is my condemnation thought d artagnan he will spare me the ennui of the bastille or the tediousness of a trial				3910.712409328005
tomorrow morning at seven o clock you will be with me will you not we will hush the curtain is rising				5650.67980040812
go to the count of monte cristo avenue des champs élysées on the 26th of may at seven o clock in the evening and demand of him your father				675.3316832588305
there i will indicate to you the best place and time the two young men bowed and separated aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg while d artagnan perceiving the appointed hour was approaching took the road to the carmes deschaux saying to himself decidedly i can t draw back but at least if i am killed i shall be killed by a musketeer chapter v the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards d artagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris				339.8714659743927
the other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay				2958.208519566261
morrel rose and advanced to the door but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair				1910.826549463478
an hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire				4867.916470989891
and why when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed might he not also be				1523.9726856642005
what is it then mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance				810.6774486850094
at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do they opened the door and the four men alighted franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father s death which had hitherto been a mystery				3401.699664642208
hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you desire that is to say replied d artagnan that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it				53.35961140736112
in the evening julie told her mother that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her father s heart beat violently				4814.820482307556
for our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers				23053.53014286161
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream				1078.450598166277
madame he said to the duchess i have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you it has succeeded since you deign to receive me				40.88070017941617
this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville s house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances				32842.38210590274
oh i entreat you my son if you had entertained such an idea dispel it and my counsel to you nay my prayer is to retain his friendship mother replied the young man you have special reasons for telling me to conciliate that man i said mercédès blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever				2742.1046310790907
a rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does a hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith				1825.4182169192954
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault at these words he retired				1214.8321550498433
then i thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose i was your accomplice so i took what little money i had and the best of my things and i got away				608.5414945404611
but go on signing said monte cristo i perceive that my story has caused a general emotion and i beg to apologize to you baroness and to mademoiselle danglars the baroness who had signed returned the pen to the notary				2020.2194785193913
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other				741.7368153453887
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank notes it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot				3484.0362114731265
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty				2781.0874667841235
is he still amusing himself in italy i believe so however he regrets your absence extremely				99192.24369161986
come back sirs back the two youths looked at each other and at this moment a pistol shot and cries for help were heard				1213.8159489823215
at last he heard the voice of la ramee				1292.9108056248178
i didn t understand it all he said but i understand now how droll it is you think so				225.51893002731444
and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you				24.81364230184857
i understand perfectly again danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial				32489.20930919898
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly				1941.9100805384023
i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no one generally stops that s well said monte cristo i remain here a day or two arrange accordingly as bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders baptistin opened the door he held a letter on a silver waiter				8506.922159708527
albert and château renaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first				2501.8296499300923
it is m maximilian morrel said she the son of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless recollect yes said the old man				161.21999659867748
you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count				233.86741508322723
on guard milady assumed the most agreeable air possible and conversed with more than her usual brilliancy				13172.449378321999
the man of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he will				2047.940473460659
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of crime is remorse				5418.86136015281
but i can t be severe with him he is really so bright after the usual civilities the count inquired after m de villefort				165.3506658258952
both were addressed to king charles				2577.862443209155
i forgot there were three more steps before the landing you have hurt yourself perhaps said morrel				86.94089827098298
when i am convinced that the statement is false what the thing is worth looking into and i will take pains to investigate the matter thoroughly but what is there to investigate sir said albert enraged beyond measure at beauchamp s last remark				5348.282874760388
well sir at last said anne of austria you are silent after rendering such a service madame replied d artagnan i have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majesty s service and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you i know that sir i have known that said the queen a long time therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem permit me madame said d artagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville he has done wonders his name asked the queen				244.62450155415343
is that all yes go but urge the king strongly not to stand on false generosity				8089.347999283973
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes				88066.96885196335
give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i am looking for the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms				19450.71213093448
you have decidedly some genius at your control ma foi spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf				1282.2261126189542
i am the abbé faria and have been imprisoned as you know in this château d if since the year 1811 previously to which i had been confined for three years in the fortress of fenestrelle				25669.946041968633
and as continued he the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family we mean to make the journey together				1123.8602485808299
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see				1276.1356637436322
ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore you d artagnan felt himself bewildered				8412.13649776962
pardieu said he here is a strange thing				1857.2189165021696
there is one thing only which i must request what is it				215.49807664128275
i implored heaven that he might come				1662.28412441617
then remarking the strange expression of milady s countenance she said pardon me madame you know him by what title why replied milady embarrassed why by the title of friend you deceive me madame said the novice you have been his mistress it is you who have been his mistress madame cried milady in her turn				1588.7453290876817
this look of porthos s made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning				30094.60997595808
sell cried mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left				1200.9829827804674
oh sir she said oh sir what a misfortune				2049.814322650204
i was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place				444.0794697811251
and what he continued has been done with the poor body by order of cromwell royal honors will be accorded to it				42.85598899394878
happily marie and a follower of hers named kitty could disguise themselves admirably in men s clothes				2175.435617014082
she wore the picturesque costume of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her hair				2915.6819607820744
her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband				2077.4054362215616
listening to the relation of those emotions so fresh and pure the fine noble face of athos betrayed indescribable pleasure he inhaled the tones of that young voice as harmonious music				29479.50338955696
the woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon stifled				36162.711788571614
at the end of fifteen months the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads				1795.7728500332732

the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood				1806.404225475955
as for eugénie she was as strong as a judith or a delilah				26249.43595271885
she was forced to return to tours she is not faithless she still loves me				125.4169840756523

we shall then be matched four against the remaining five				6254.183617034619
aramis could not in his jealousy avoid being pleased at the coadjutor s misfortune and was about to utter some bon mot more witty than correct when athos stopped him				11.208187894470356
he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d antin				23654.42014968227

aramis confiding in the address of bazin made a pompous eulogium on his candidate				48950.03554685928
valentine looked at m d avrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room				402.41071247852085
the affair as it will be reported will cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound				4002.7421984550024
valentine uttered a cry of horror morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown danger				2408.019871295403

the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when d artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in a choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing d artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness				36595.72154907817
you are the child of my captivity				2032.9860115728611
he no longer possessed strength will power or feeling he followed where they led him				12.37616372827503

milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was about to be pulled she reached her hand quickly to her bosom drew out a paper and held it toward athos				47.86903102716619
in the evening about nine o clock at the moment he had made up his mind to go to bed he heard steps in his corridor				12728.34561202209
sit down and i will read it again albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend				719.9073645136696
monsieur your friend pardon for not calling him by the honorable name which no doubt he bears but we do not know that name monsieur your friend having disabled two men with his pistols retreated fighting with his sword with which he disabled one of my men and stunned me with a blow of the flat side of it you villain will you finish cried d artagnan athos what has become of athos while fighting and retreating as i have told monseigneur he found the door of the cellar stairs behind him and as the door was open he took out the key and barricaded himself inside				4410.219602974525
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror				654.812082233659
he now arose his head bowed beneath the weight of grief and shaking his damp dishevelled hair he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes someone by whose side he might weep				5395.203156623374

teresa was lively and gay but coquettish to excess				156185.7478912589
the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself				1780.2659658613682
but these 200 francs here they are and 200 more besides				7253.838392958517
you are welcome gentlemen she said				422.5827511117319
0295m it seemed however to edmond who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto				6017.693560031729
but the soil was moist on reaching the top of the bank she slipped and fell upon her knees				751.9316118403971
d artagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but athos raised his hand				347.14511431645093
you can not at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement				2108.498467002468
so my dear aramis say no more about it and let us prepare to submit to destiny zounds				4903.270820897504
blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor				3191.3069251275724

at nine o clock lord de winter made his customary visit examined the window and the bars sounded the floor and the walls looked to the chimney and the doors without during this long and minute examination he or milady pronouncing a single word				1220.9012901325016
but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance good said milady to herself who knows				5472.88463205222
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lost thirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london				3231.9719480823055
our position is truly a strange one continued athos laughing				1246.537159883229
standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m de villefort held a high position in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a molé				26096.354146785914
you have spurs yes but i got down to defend monsieur de comminges and my horse was taken away				571.7827859106128
no positively i will not go				1472.2387075537285
what do you mean cried d artagnan				1.550988429446975
he is a bully and so am i his cassock is a burden to him and i imagine i have had enough of mine in fact there is so much resemblance between us that i sometimes believe he is aramis and i am the coadjutor				3584.823269653808
it must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor in which d artagnan lodged those who called on him were exempted from this detention				23381.691843851164
my dear sir said château renaud allow me to tell you that you do not understand that manœuvre with the eye glass half so well as debray				912.5802925815772
at the letter s the old man stopped her				65.18204873802027
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe				59483.938200804456
in all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive clientage				29365.52585722485
the devil take this gout athos and aramis took their leave but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the duke s cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned				27315.32790181179
i had but to write to the duchesse but i won t repeat her name for i am incapable of compromising a woman but this i know that i had but to write to her and she would have sent me fifteen hundred the procurator s wife shed a tear				7414.620746339511
he related the manner in which he had become acquainted with valentine and how he had loved her and that valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion				5014.993367835648
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him				18.031945203438216
halt he cried this time we shall be pursued				10532.272584739378
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them				60.84512372898627
danglars followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were following him				47.882260367006566
he then tried to draw him from his moist abode but to his surprise he perceived that athos staggered				40038.36135913273
you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars				443.7280979002595
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy d artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him				16.921893797142584
is the spot far from here a hundred leagues it is not ill planned said the governor				2081.3169683966944
the prince exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort whilst d artagnan and porthos stepped backward				60641.99969152038
the soldier on guard at her door stopped as if he had been changed into stone				1629.6725377393795
the woman who was here the woman with the embroidered handkerchief who told you there was a woman here replied aramis becoming as pale as death				743.61053949265
excuse me said d artagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him				12.679658394872506
my daughter continued the banker you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you who is determined she will not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father like me who has decided that his daughter shall marry eugénie bowed not as a submissive daughter but as an adversary prepared for a discussion				20697.100748736793
besides even you didn t recognize me they will be much less likely to that is true said mordaunt and they will be far from thinking of you				88.98723795606927
adieu and raising himself by a final effort in which he summoned all his faculties he said monte cristo forget not monte cristo and he fell back on the bed				1691.5582073800886
sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man				426.1022725091874
nonsense cried d artagnan i can manage so that her majesty will receive me well i know an excellent method what i shall take her majesty the letter in which you tell her that the finances are exhausted and then asked mazarin turning pale				726.115742377113
are you satisfied gentlemen asked mazarin				119.3087792670741
albert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such a man				451.2497562094459
madame danglars is ill said villefort it would be better to take her to her carriage oh mon dieu said monte cristo and i have forgotten my smelling bottle i have mine said madame de villefort and she passed over to monte cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on edward				3742.297996029247
everyone had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred one hundred steps in advance at length they reached it but it was not the friend				749.9385744854419
take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours they approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay				23348.446111512123
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape				894.3556165703123
suppose we warn the masters let s wait for grimaud but perhaps they have killed him grimaud would have cried out you know he is almost dumb we should have heard the blow then but if he doesn t return here he is at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them				155.82561445736783
morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied dantès				156.55915019826844
and yours i said the traveller am called sinbad the sailor franz d épinay started with surprise				1027.9970580875902
such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate and demanded if it was not at no				503.50822903760303
she is perhaps a prisoner she is perhaps dead yes but you have at least this consolation that you can say to yourself she has not quit you voluntarily that if you learn no news of her it is because all communication with you is interdicted while i well nothing replied aramis nothing so you renounce the world then forever that is a settled thing a resolution registered forever				2428.7862893105616
i bought my experience dearly particularly fair women				2094.218935706841
if she seduced your brother you said she seduced him did you not yes if she caused his death you said that she caused his death yes repeated the executioner				1925.247758497173
on entering the court of his hôtel buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestibule				9913.95166581997
the more she has forgotten the high position in which she was placed the more degrading is her fall				6799.834995405748
i do not tell you this madame to terrify you no it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you and believe me i take no heed of such dreams				3883.7146087716774
whom does your highness wish me to send to you any one except grimaud the officer of the guard then with his chessboard yes five minutes afterward the officer entered and the duke seemed to be immersed in the sublime combinations of chess				16344.236268099423
i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at rome i who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage				4979.047131033035
maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his father s neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on morrel s breast				1484.3404214539148
if there is a sentinel within the apartment kill him without hesitation				2798.963827853141
you can sleep here yes do stay added la carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of you no i must sleep at beaucaire				153219.92012302158
i am no swordsman well don t be alarmed if i return at one two or three o clock in the morning indeed do not be alarmed if i do not come at all this time bonacieux became so pale that d artagnan could not help perceiving it and asked him what was the matter				1322.967450122098
coquenard in that tone which says take my advice don t touch them devil take me if i taste one of them murmured porthos to himself and then said aloud thank you my cousin i am no longer hungry there was silence				914.1503653278882
suddenly he heard a cry it was his daughter s voice				360.798622103382
this was the more easy for our three companions in particular for being friends of m de tréville they obtained from him special permission to be absent after the closing of the camp				1577.6787916607323
that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable				75009.52669895541
but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody s professions of friendship				4707.629160198659
he shall go thither and at his return you will send him to me				50.76593657207419
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement				29047.968669992064
franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred				39932.16124844136
are you not a christian he said falling on his knees				761.1768791913356
i monsieur replied the abbé with an air of surprise i want nothing you do not understand continued the inspector i am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners oh that is different cried the abbé and we shall understand each other i hope there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abbé faria born at rome				1553.8540009786848
he s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head				447.6714962739913
when it was seen that danglars sold the spanish funds fell directly				10553.366743175273
there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that porthos was not at bracieux				39032.58689973903
he is a subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament more reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament the queen shook her head despairingly				9632.694994615335
d artagnan declined all others being unwilling to take the first chance from those who had the priority				41683.84327317609
according to the arrangements the carriage was waiting at the door				288.5319684889307
but continued m de tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as i have said i will do something for you young man				89.17817624529098
i would not choose to see the man against whom i pleaded smile as though in mockery of my words				798.382354436388
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos				174.9659375502949
tis raoul who has come back said athos and we can now hear how the poor child is in fact the young man appeared at the gate covered with dust entered the courtyard leaped from his horse which he consigned to the charge of a groom and then went to greet the count and d artagnan				11.931406641918068
have you neglected to obtain information on that point				1191.542538815322
it is an every day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness valentine looked at him a moment with her large scrutinizing eyes endeavoring not to let morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart				359.9766819709996
the queen had restored broussel and blancmesnil to the people and had therefore nothing to fear since the people had nothing more just then to ask for				1100.9457329664895
confess you know i have the right of giving absolution i monseigneur said athos				14.102065791554406
it is certainly the king said the man rising again				289.1593390541984
no replied d artagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way ah you surprise me				47.439494954223825
i don t ask porthos his opinion has been given why i think said aramis blushing as usual that his ring not coming from a mistress and consequently not being a love token d artagnan may sell it my dear aramis you speak like theology personified				6554.546933568165
just as he turned a hand rested on his shoulder and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed good evening maximilian you are punctual thank you ah is it you count said the young man in an almost joyful accent pressing monte cristo s hand with both his own				976.7466223195668
noirtier made a sign that it did				3460.020288457048
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with papers				4666.0966009002805
the horses only arrived at two o clock and the cicerone did not bring the passport till three				3248.655923578562
begone begone at these words she opened the door of the corridor and pushed d artagnan out of the room				476.3875159831987

the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of spanish wine then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining room				486.3786326269509

no count he replied i am the only victim in this case				4153.877854906405
the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within				9979.918015768833
he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o clock fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on one side in the corso and on the other in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the hôtel de londres				14068.505369999499

his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen				486.1402737917831
why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear planchet and no one could find fault with it ah monsieur replied planchet recurring to his besetting idea that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips what the devil makes you think of bonacieux monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we will because you are a coward planchet monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a virtue and you are very virtuous are you not planchet monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder				15500.362630039965

he passed on to another it also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full				7408.711634737607
aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and athos who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out fire				3563.1424042632943
the sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembrances				8240.412223728441

planchet called his master s attention to a gentleman who had just arrived with his lackey and only preceded them by about fifty paces				3218.2757972820623
at the same moment a fearful hurrah rent the air and thirty blades glittered about their heads				1767.5240000301205
he told him his birth his position his fortune and more than once when he consulted the look of the paralytic that look answered that is good proceed and now said morrel when he had finished the first part of his recital now i have told you of my love and my hopes may i inform you of my intentions yes signified the old man				160.3752014332393

grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastion something he had till then doubted he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat				3255.3051734822157
at that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone and as one of them drooped over the road he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion				10885.68783322375
let us see i have told you				33.51822271140068

the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals				25110.288555079987
at the same moment a well known voice above him pronounced these words colonel i want to speak to the people athos shuddered from head to foot				1577.0342058125889
hardly had d artagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication				19755.471313548434
d artagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame pooh said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in d artagnan s proposal pooh				9331.975175234242

franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide				8345.48677533904
there was not on the pavement in the carriages at the windows a single tongue that was silent a single arm that did not move				12837.219303565493

what is your name in your turn if you please d artagnan to yours monsieur and above all others cried d artagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the cardinal the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of d artagnan if the wine had been bad but the wine was good and he was convinced				5695.905709641355
the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive				97860.53927800023

albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departed not however without walking several times to the door of the press room as if he had half a mind to enter				2683.1935651304893
edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale				846.8275218996064

the door is opened to all who knock				43473.99791115085
felton sat down upon an armchair which happened to be near the door and waited without speaking a word without making a gesture				1997.3526420846404
the queen stretched out her hand seized the ring pressed it convulsively to her lips and without being able to breathe a sigh to give vent to a sob she extended her arms became deadly pale and fell senseless in the arms of her attendants and her daughter				2170.790240070073

he was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected humility				107038.41927095465
the room was neatly comfortably furnished				36653.981741627365
then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited				8526.642941791937
you have come then at last				2203.065620095501
she cried out but d avrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left				1231.2328871645877
in which the plot thickens his visit to m de tréville being paid the pensive d artagnan took the longest way homeward				64334.03596867514

la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him				55.38923292823676
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes watering pots hung against the wall this was all the furniture				2098.3802422421786

then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is real an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step				3161.7495422075713
thank him then my child in your very best manner for had he not come to our aid neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our thanks the child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner saying he s too ugly 20353m the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes while madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed				7433.333325033822
as to franz he had no letter of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight days he had brought but a hundred louis and of these he had not more than fifty left				1114.2086023440115
good thought he mazarin has been listening to discover whether i betrayed him				11.25630838313933
because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty				2252.5949514366916
so much the better said d artagnan				1.491019267264657
in the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions he had already devoured those of the previous day he ate these listening anxiously for the sound walking round and round his cell shaking the iron bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny				7243.206616517292
d artagnan thought this could not last long and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears				2823.6900236037704
you know me well enough we no longer know anyone madame you must be mad my friend said the baroness				1433.8902942097836

the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do				1436.5504256365768
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints				35136.347837276815
in short up to this period nothing had been wanting to tréville but opportunity but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand				418.73474147032147
i listen to your eminence with greatest attention replied a female voice which made the musketeer start				3623.5016783478386

i had no longer any wish to live for myself i have lived for him				20.191248376830494
a secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by lackeys porthos s plan appears to me to be impracticable said d artagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you				24.178732926023738
to day it s a sort of diplomatic arrangement ask planchet mousqueton inquired therefore the state of the case of his old friend who confirmed the statement of d artagnan				5.825236737600375

well i will go to england a second time i will go and find buckingham you shall not do that d artagnan said athos coolly				6354.672258368576

i think this is about your position is it not confound it yes replied danglars				122.5989520935603
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count s chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honoré				5818.259755820407
as for the two others i had so much the habit of calling them by nicknames that i have forgotten their real ones oh mon dieu it is a matter of the greatest urgency to find them out said the queen since you think these worthy gentlemen might be so useful to the king oh yes said de winter for they are the same men				669.2411935445223

i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal oh no certainly not well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me but this secret is not mine and i can not reveal it in this manner you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan with chagrin				123945.73700129021

totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass				1197.1031023582282
it depends on you only i listen i am waiting to hear sir the favor i have to ask of you is not to call me mousqueton but mouston since i have had the honor of being my lord s steward i have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me				250.68713428019313

and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity curiosity that is a terrible word why so				188.98646087129754
nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french speak italian sir				536.5135816226732

it is true that the habit of a novice which the young woman wore was not very advantageous in a contest of this kind				3223.878866178929
when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not possible the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could comprehend				2726.685210530181
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man s road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st martin the same at which they had stopped on their first journey				2592.864311773986

i never believe in anything i have not seen and as i never have seen apparitions i don t believe in them the bible said aramis makes our belief in them a law the ghost of samuel appeared to saul and it is an article of faith that i should be very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon porthos at all events man or devil body or shadow illusion or reality this man is born for my damnation for his flight has caused us to miss a glorious affair gentlemen an affair by which there were a hundred pistoles and perhaps more to be gained how is that cried porthos and aramis in a breath				3715.449322685882

besides courage was out of the question here d artagnan had fallen into an ambush				32752.14539799081
this morning i ventured to run along the gutters and well interrupted d artagnan i am delighted that de rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the king s servants they will hang thee without mercy				14302.33624785621
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions				26446.584776270294

the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen				480.09845781143525
be it understood we are speaking of athos				118.32697951363497
he however darted not the less quickly toward milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron				6836.364529591284
come first of all said athos to d artagnan my friend that i may shake hands with you you our rescuer you the true hero of us all athos is right you have my adoration said aramis in his turn pressing his hand				297.0340273896921

as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name				668.8666526027233
go monsieur duke and return often				326113.7748838796
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door				313.1707119395328
that health which excellent my dear friend better than ever				2657.8606052716505
monsieur if she has escaped it is not my fault i swear what business had you then to go into the chamber of monsieur d artagnan your neighbor with whom you had a long conference during the day ah yes monsieur commissary yes that is true and i confess that i was in the wrong				1414.0670359386743
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so d artagnan declares just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door				271.8152387599311
to purchase back my liberty said the cardinal				303.3598022219331
my sword is shorter than yours it s true but bah				2630.69497117628
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty				28329.350639649845
like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous				28368.76878616674

go the valet bowed and retired and albert returned to his inventory				32674.86791090171
perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so violently				3844.204821125426
you must die athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of defense				22593.15061272254
you are examining my den said aramis				19.659026679433595
what tenderness my sister but am i not your nearest relative demanded milady with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness				51104.8046734204
formerly his paper at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request				14676.848004902622
although general d épinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments				41839.64672179309
oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me courage madame				784.2480053247075
here they found only one inn in which was consumed a liqueur which preserves its reputation to our time and which is still made in that town				9832.505074355722
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs				22337.536217048248
in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others				1027.8328584919982
before his departure the count went to haydée s apartments told her his intention and resigned everything to her care				2655.3536696108813
he should have been nothing said the king nothing				775.8833522636157
then d artagnan became almost wild				35653.87655422432
a sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat replied				4446.098196605206
ten minutes after he raised his head his resolution was made				4603.3948984019125
but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner i have described				8256.947715184924
the promise volume four chapter 74				25800.440856251593
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since half past eight and did not see you come i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event what voices asked valentine				202.1996549235937
are you fond of traveling my life has been passed on the high road would anything retain you particularly in paris nothing but an order from a superior would retain me in paris very well				816.22844352783
fernand saw this and when he learned of the old man s death he returned				1100.1186881541837
suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light				2147.3676539290295
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my child				1168.9496543319883
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to franz gradually emerging from the staircase opposite upon which the moon was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness				24164.546817830353
but his successive defeats did service to the duke in one way they killed time for him till eight o clock in the evening then would come night and with night sleep				1225.9322709326993
but never mind that will do capitally d artagnan opened the door and called out to a waiter to desire madeleine to come upstairs				12468.320546556104
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his				860.4236045346337
he received thirty sous per day and for a month he returned to his lodgings gay as a chaffinch and affable toward his master				1532.3445014268648
the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amélie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty francs				1024.9770478316216
weep said athos weep heart full of love youth and life				614.658751289592
ma foi i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow creatures				3793.84976212402
thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model				14294.795443251372
i will arm him against love alas madame exclaimed athos to day love is like war the breastplate is becoming useless raoul entered at this moment he came to announce that the solemn entrance of the king queen and her ministers was to take place on the ensuing day				486.10689433427234
with discretion d artagnan remained behind but at the moment when buckingham crossed the threshold he turned round and seeing the hesitation of the young man come in cried he and if you have the good fortune to be admitted to her majesty s presence tell her what you have seen encouraged by this invitation d artagnan followed the duke who closed the door after them				49.810890386261015
one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king louis xiv then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre dame				2249.2880144757037
the worthy sergeant had recognized the minister s secretary and the millionnaire and by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to beauchamp				487.76983969782776
and then our gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with de wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself				139.78991999807891
and now said d artagnan to athos entertain no further doubts about me i undertake all that concerns the king chapter lxiv				4507.98134218602
that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans oh may god keep me from it and you too said d artagnan				1.5188599912732106
as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more				1269.166040889402
the baroness approached leaning on madame de villefort s arm				751.1059687212298
under pretext of trading along the coast these men who are in reality smugglers will prefer selling me to doing a good action				2495.4839777814277
conspiracy danglars followed edmond and mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas then turning round he perceived fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking song				15336.925147072006
well said he extending his hand to monte cristo i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my house				591.0202274444532
well that has happened friend porthos				112.79958278931798
but do not be alarmed on her account				4628.336754917984
if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris the four horses will follow you thither				14675.084497302396
and what did he say or rather do ali placed himself in the light so that his master might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent manner the countenance of the old man he closed his eyes as noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying yes good he accepts said monte cristo				6.371053989607379
he even opened his mouth to tell milady who he was and with what a revengeful purpose he had come but she added poor angel whom that monster of a gascon barely failed to kill the monster was himself				510.2060398609784
do i look so asked the baron rising and going a step backward				33484.519313966535
well penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head why i says i still think you ve got too much on i think you re right answered he we shall have a gale a gale				48138.95483345621
try therefore either to carry me to some place where i may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here				653.1343907345722
as long as your brother was with me he kept me up but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father				767.923126485512
and what else does your worship wish for to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom the viscount de bragelonne				7329.719563374067
hush cried la ramee give me your gibbet my lord				576.202762865064
and yet said aramis i am somewhat of porthos s opinion is the king accustomed to give you such reasons				25011.820335817625
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids				31535.99312543234
yes mademoiselle you especially replied the doctor abruptly				31049.204775919206
i can not explain myself but watch over him emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them				62.12408160717737
oh m d avrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m noirtier just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking and the same love for you eh my dear child yes said valentine he was very fond of me who does not love you valentine smiled sadly				20050.85028790783
so much the worse so much the worse diavolo as they say in my country reverend sir i am impelled every criminal says the same thing poverty pshaw said busoni disdainfully poverty may make a man beg steal a loaf of bread at a baker s door but not cause him to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited				4231.52192867412
eugénie concealed louise in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but one person				1571.4755504262955
two other men descended after danglars forming the rearguard and pushing danglars whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors				23757.715334906858
in the first blazed piles of golden coin in the second were ranged bars of unpolished gold which possessed nothing attractive save their value in the third edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds pearls and rubies which as they fell on one another sounded like hail against glass				1420.2467880136246
no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door				280.74435769374554
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant				7088.926082949429
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another				667.3257152700469
ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less				5288.363512140225
franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air				1462.7333115420442
bonacieux moved by a double sentiment love and curiosity				1532.576874901893
journeys you know appear much shorter when we travel two in company have you no friends in paris then monsieur porthos said the procurator s wife				751.86564173082
i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which i am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion and without listening to villefort he arose and followed valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to				2944.411431751575
in the court of the old chateau of saint germain he entered his coach and reached the seine at chatou				24795.696013835564
i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon				2286.041913280567
d artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side				955.4565536645451
at the noise he made in pushing the bolt milady turned round				8106.4770994517785
we owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself monsieur d artagnan for from the moment i withdraw my hand from behind you i would not give an obolus for your life i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence				9758.016403318503
her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor and that in the presence of witnesses				3248.3925906759355
you may reckon upon me and so may your friend then bowing to the two musketeers with his most gracious smile he re entered his closet more calmly for on the departure of de gondy the uproar had ceased as though by enchantment				3545.911773567213
amongst the catalans mercédès wished for a thousand things but still she never really wanted any				146213.36904085317
bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king but the cardinal who feared that bassompierre a huguenot at heart might press but feebly the english and rochellais his brothers in religion supported the duc d angoulême whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant general				3273.329952484473
the duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like st laurence on his gridiron				44048.751662968825
he was wealthy once perhaps said the inspector				1482.2567399181446
wait it ought to be there in my pocket it speaks of his return does it not porthos all gascon as he was d artagnan could not bear alone the weight of that falsehood				10999.708024255298
sit down dear count and go on with your story at this point i have to accuse myself of a fault madame				801.5568206512808
i wish to be sure of my revenge				11922.990535808372
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving d artagnan s composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge you accept however i always accept do you think the thing possible everything is possible shall you be attacked on the road probably and what will you do in that case i shall pass through those who attack me and suppose you can not pass through them so much the worse for them i shall pass over them and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain yes on your life on my life you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration				1732.6560729058028
is it my fault if fortune which has frowned on you has been kind to me fortune has been kind to you then				687.0416291980418
instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly this has been your course you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best friend help cried caderousse i require a surgeon not a priest perhaps i am not mortally wounded i may not die perhaps they can yet save my life your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead				969.0840591782862
and does the husband of this frightful creature still live said aramis				17.75873568834058
he was carried home in the arms of the people				1064.5930381546148
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor				1213.6845701844773
what are you thinking of asked the abbé smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder				2487.092386195178
i can scarcely credit it nevertheless it is quite true still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction you are most kind but as regards myself i can find no merit i possess save that as a millionaire i might have become a partner in the speculations of m aguado and m rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution				1642.018042750435
oh and do you know who is his lieutenant his lieutenant				1663.2918737267257
i am credited on you for six millions				2005.497085700881
the count advanced to meet him				18.23599378790501
and you have not been tempted by the hopes of reputation yourself i should my dear d artagnan have been so but nature said no when i am in the pulpit if by chance a pretty woman looks at me i look at her again if she smiles i smile too				2154.98083531928
on the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench a book a parasol and a work basket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman standing close to the iron gate endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter				1360.7232993472637
now sir i am listening go on i will come at once to the point				1156.5998573491024
as they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio				14258.891496957678
am i come to a friend she asked in a tone full of mournful dignity				5239.66334160508
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory				4665.304579432065
the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow and knitted his brow like a man disquieted				37855.7528672716
i also intend from this time to work on my own account				5073.779478182781
ali returned a sign in the negative				7856.362701076223
so d artagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarin s nor you of the prince de condé no let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither cardinalists nor frondists adieu then and d artagnan poured out a glass of wine				1668.2689914680948
you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning interrupted mordaunt				1179.808857797527
0317m when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him				21.71488915235504
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardes he whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governor s country house so it is said d artagnan i know him now				970.0521699605409
so now you are both forewarned the young men bowed and quitted the box				1369.7832817981837
if you had taken what madame de villefort has poured into your glass valentine valentine you would have been doomed but exclaimed the young girl why am i thus pursued why are you so kind so good so unsuspicious of ill that you can not understand valentine no i have never injured her but you are rich valentine you have 200 000 livres a year and you prevent her son from enjoying these 200 000 livres how so				646.5111979550674
my father died but i did not die				862.463478911517
the political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive				23745.823322656797
athos and aramis were more and more astonished				1988.7319705386014
who ever heard of such an occurrence as this a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams				52317.867745517426
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you wish me to do so yes well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron by whom are you charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable				10069.603123629244
d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or looking indeed as if he had never seen them before				604.2556809924835
the clock striking eight awoke her				101.85453283272052
if you mean to buy any horses get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it at what hour shall we come asked the young man				207.84744850205567
as he entered the chamber of his friend dantès cast around one eager and searching glance in quest of the expected marvels but nothing more than common met his view				3676.7079929272318
and then he a wanderer on the earth a man without fortune a man without family a soldier accustomed to inns cabarets taverns and restaurants a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats was about to partake of family meals to enjoy the pleasures of a comfortable establishment and to give himself up to those little attentions which the harder one is the more they please as old soldiers say				787.334359412645
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter				2188.3459849579513
ah this is not right athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room				476.73201393671764
have you informed him of it i wrote to him from boulogne				2799.127994612147
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was something				5225.9347973859285
while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince i laid a few snares in the runs and while reclining on the banks of his highness s pieces of water i slipped a few lines into his fish ponds				22376.234162154702
the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches				7526.16417443558
the count followed them with his eyes his hands resting on the shoulders of the youth whose height was almost equal to his own but as soon as they were out of sight he said raoul we set out to night for paris eh cried the young man turning pale				659.9324175318056
he expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her majesty he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to buckingham and all with a tranquillity and candor of which m de tréville was the more the dupe from having himself as we have said observed something fresh between the cardinal the king and the queen				497.2270887066006
morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only and none of the banks would give him credit				2805.6115934048476
no more edicts no more of the cardinal s guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds				33095.990949937615
let us not lose a moment the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game				2208.878357635359

but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred names that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire				3401.1741588337536
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled and affixed his seal				4806.223188911142
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor				18307.80132770208
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations				16474.95509811469
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out				231.75054237763715
pardieu mute as a carp well i think andrea stopped and looked around				1382.4396130988332

tony carries our muskets then we set sail to night asked aramis glancing toward the west where the sun had left a single golden cloud which dipping into the ocean appeared by degrees to be extinguished				11339.2369239742
all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrini s the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting				9058.681018954863
it was a frightful thing to see this wretch leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over pale with approaching death trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice which lay twenty paces from him				54.311472217856995
i serve the queen and that draws me naturally into the service of the cardinal but i serve the one with joy and the other against my will				2000.6707411546463

bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband				2098.8095374027557
ah but what is the matter with your hand d artagnan				10.828761808693054

in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on d artagnan s finger the place of the queen s ring carefully kept in a casket				14259.625826150366
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility				12921.872692023806
five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince s door				192.74218998477934
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science				41080.667922320994

you owe me nothing but some trifle of 20 000 francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself				262.2793937932673
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library				12685.386591954137
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc d angoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home				2612.6820844659733

all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next a sublime spot a resting place full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking				12880.962755131748

although la rochelle was invested however certain success might appear thanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city the blockade might last a long time yet				1728.3346886667703
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door				327.9749648346748
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed renée you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint méran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past				2147.359462387136
i will continue then resumed aramis				74.57951014740921
three months passed and still she wept no news of edmond no news of fernand no companionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair				1410.6478582839718
the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery				6504.0166360680105
yes what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer				1161.193103300914

not locked he cried that is well and he entered the little room in which edward slept for though the child went to school during the day his mother could not allow him to be separated from her at night				724.2505291365736
athos dwelt in the rue férou within two steps of the luxembourg				6349.171898941104
i have almost killed myself by my needless haste				1370.009295036479
he is walking about and thinking thought d artagnan but of what				876.4083858622886
very brave said monte cristo i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his head and i know he has fought two duels said morrel				92.33013683822283
at sight of this man d artagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the door				269.1205796460994
you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination				77465.01629747865
he told me to watch you and why so				269.0229407495084
you are madame s brother i learn be it so but fortunately you are not mine it might be thought that milady timid as women are in general would have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman go on home the pretty soubrette cast an anxious glance at d artagnan whose good looks seemed to have made an impression on her				89.17056486932964
he was in bed but surrounded with all the paraphernalia of war				3501.613954108203
and now said la ramee i must ask your highness s pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grimaud s eyes				483.3950814764755
bear witness that we have done all that we could that shall be testified to rest assured				4854.555424026054
but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion				3257.3858537761594
he had only two hours work to do to open communication with the king and according to the calculations of the four friends they had the entire day before them since the executioner being absent another must be sent for to bristol				73225.19970614718
was it a corps sent out to make a diversion				36864.248399472606
andrea ran to the other door leading to the gallery ready to rush out but he was stopped short and he stood with his body a little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched hand				554.681031457578
i must have left it in my room she said				507.5678874153552
but it has not been so with me i see and always have seen during the last sixteen years				2485.439737859314
mazarin endeavored to circulate among the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the quays and on the pont neuf on account of the ceremonial of the day and that they would soon withdraw				7102.36521186633
now really let me ask sir have you do you believe you have anything to do				1419.0303333467955
of course not rejoined caderousse quickly no more do i and that was what i was observing to this gentleman just now				950.7445792602267
the queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the gascon s eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd				3109.5119678417345
all day dantès walked up and down his cell				3086.5054495296167
villefort whispered some words in his ear to which the officer replied by a motion of his head				382.23947345837604
parry who accompanied him stood behind him				13.231777673859883
what makes you believe this why when i found myself utterly destitute i thought my old friends would perhaps assist me				37.02695553555573
the abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving				24715.33207664328
i hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble or else i warn you i will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion				1992.8841690156644
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity				11044.992503535412
i wrote to franz and were he here he would confirm every word i wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being and signor luigi vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said château renaud				935.7752694910304
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present				2614.711073216749
the days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire				19411.981984616275
that would be too terrible calm yourself sir replied de guiche				3656.6677327722946
some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the musketeers that the burial would take place at midday				26623.522267472414
he was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding franz smiled for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion				3246.351710304141
how replied d artagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed				3960.786150155428
however i shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which i found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain me				143.28240228182506
so we will take leave of our friend and let him hasten home stop a moment said monte cristo do not let me lose both my companions				3073.5605742862895
confiteor said caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger i was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller s shop it is another branch of industry paralyzed have you finished said andrea do you want anything more will you have my waistcoat or my hat				925.7759120904276
that would boom the market she will buy heavily and she will certainly lose when beauchamp announces the following day in his gazette the report circulated by some usually well informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielle s house is totally without foundation				4532.311141643946
d artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that and each day milady gave him a more gracious reception				11202.770975860394

no he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that i see you nothing more				1461.3982362768818
it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect				10012.44492949816
i respect old age but i don t much like it boiled or roasted and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt				1067.8840521695624
surely if i am culpable and if i ask for pardon i ought to be forgiven then as if his strength failed him he seemed unable to sustain himself above the water and a wave passed over his head which drowned his voice				665.2472571239458
empty he exclaimed the infernal demons we must pursue them said groslow they can t be gone far and we will sink them passing over them yes but the fire ejaculated mordaunt i have lighted it ten thousand devils cried groslow rushing to the hatchway perhaps there is still time to save us mordaunt answered only by a terrible laugh threw his torch into the sea and plunged in after it				44.160588877533144
and the other which the short one oh he was not a gentleman i ll answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration some lackey murmured d artagnan				2.0040771778106974
20169m behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions				27134.957214751685
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse d artagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st germain				4384.713282096385
the quick eager glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended while caderousse on the contrary turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him				56.170453734952034
one would think it had been placed here on purpose get on it that s it friend and d artagnan coughed				54372.82492629153

athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired				2518.812826103333
but the glass cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies				22650.925905623386
now said the count what will you take a glass of sherry port or alicante alicante if you please it is my favorite wine i have some that is very good				1476.249877341723
the two arms fell with a sudden force they heard the hissing of the scimitar and the cry of the victim then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow				1735.2464756672516
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baron s right hand with his left and held out his other hand				592.0045995102863

a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air				1596.6999945020639
athos had been out since six o clock				838.594771648028
oh make yourself easy on that head said ali smiling selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter				1254.382201183811
dantès struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession				1727.1310479108884
do you know count that persons of our time of life not that you belong to the class you are still a young man but as i was saying persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this year				2538.016199424312
to the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect silence unbroken save by the footsteps of a man walking about in the chamber above				9540.411819301888
could you ever have credited such a thing my dear danglars asked m morrel as on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of dantès from m de villefort the assistant procureur he overtook his supercargo and caderousse				975.3140981584575

my very self replied planchet but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud proud toward an old friend				480.5679912700973
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project				3549.3694995150945

he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie				1284.5289253422045
have you the money he demands yes all but eight hundred piastres the count went to his secrétaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with gold said to franz i hope you will not offend me by applying to anyone but myself you see on the contrary i come to you first and instantly replied franz				213.59676585012528
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way				681.8029564613644
my intention was if caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the custom house officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew				11168.400621125817

grimaud waited till he heard the bolt grind in the lock and when he was satisfied that he was alone he slowly rose from his recumbent posture				37510.11087500744
every time he passed with a friend before his windows at one of which mousqueton was sure to be placed in full livery porthos raised his head and his hand and said that is my abode but he was never to be found at home he never invited anybody to go up with him and no one could form an idea of what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches				22565.329668345777
so much the better but what has de rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room ah sir				405.03982879230466
he escapes us so much the better muttered athos				27.72232287041302

one may soon see that you re a soldier				3356.798404204784
i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me				73.48035202886663
a man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common every day sort of attachment such as ours				2126.078562815779

what do you fear everything replied athos				14.954308418830646
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief				92047.26974300583
this is a detail preserved to us by brienne				73406.15070169691

he preserved his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends had regained their carriage then suddenly unfastening his horse from the little tree to which his servant had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris				455.8360726158476

i can not consent that this woman should die thus milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope				1787.520950876912
there it is all blood stained on the desk as a testimony of the crime ah very good hush gentlemen here is the court let us go back to our places a noise was heard in the hall the sergeant called his two patrons with an energetic hem and the door keeper appearing called out with that shrill voice peculiar to his order ever since the days of beaumarchais the court gentlemen chapter 110				18478.91521536311

oh monsieur you can write as much as you like you may become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade				38197.14786319346
there were nobles who made war against each other there was the king who made war against the cardinal there was spain which made war against the king				856.7602225827109
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand				519.2882111797327
over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a full length portrait of anne of austria so perfect in its resemblance that d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it				96.41912799352173
the bell of monte citorio which only sounds on the pope s decease and the opening of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal				20141.271062662512
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone				1561.1262041269006
athos followed the road for some time his eyes fixed upon the ground slight stains of blood which came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage as a courier or from one of the horses dotted the road				2683.8743169543814

this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu not such as he is now represented broken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts but such as he really was at this period that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nîmes castres and uzes to drive the english from the isle of ré and lay siege to la rochelle				4113.619914651035
it was even according to our present manners something like an infamous action but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do today				2943.1438883470178
is it not a curious affair so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure m de morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to one s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them beauchamp was thunderstruck				5914.857150452378
that is all very well and enough for today before we proceed further someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife but i have not told you that i know him cried bonacieux in despair				1451.5218710657903
ah yes that is the name certainly				2299.2315083240264
listen said m de tréville shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend you will do me honor monsieur said d artagnan				1.4672533082330423
as to d artagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying				18743.63853007406
it s tiresome work to keep awake a whole night yes but with a jovial partner and dice and guineas clinking on the cloth the night passes like a dream				1128.4569130419454
i supplicate you i implore you on my knees let me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself				142.2943984505195
i once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss				12134.913285909992
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event poor girl so young so rich so beautiful				5099.674491998362
no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good it is so good that i have distanced m de château renaud one of the best riders in france and m debray who both mount the minister s arabians and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour then they follow you asked monte cristo				6.072402523720165
bonacieux was the very life of d artagnan				9.102534009774105
to give them the order to charge and run down these miserable rebels and the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of lord leven				19218.01870069383
in an hour inquired danglars turning pale				737.2473057647024
how should i know what horse furniture is you should have left it to me then madame who know what they are but you wished to be frugal and consequently to lend at usury it was wrong monsieur porthos but i will repair that wrong upon my word of honor how so asked the musketeer				1041.5942861551475
porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand in				727.9139067316914
when i return which will be in about an hour you must offer him to me as a servant and upon your recommendation though he doesn t speak a word of french i take him into my service				981.9507448861187
but presently the exempt s face suddenly brightened				5501.456603831952
but felton did not give him time to draw it				47.49480137140969
ah ha whispered monte cristo with a smile of disappointment he is only a thief but the man in the dark could not find the right key				3938.7091517194344
d artagnan was too good a swordsman to trifle with his opponent				10924.51066772179
the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain				9527.337221550531
he filled two glasses and by a sign invited d artagnan to drink				4328.7805491244935
did you not tell me it was a family jewel yes my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it as he once told me				34.14957956969199
the bare idea would kill me would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my finger nails				5392.543709422236
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength				4289.461146235448
and yet you say he has sent you some as from us here is his letter said d artagnan and he presented the note to his comrades				5468.356111266461
have you had another fall at the bourse no i am safe for a few days at least				1659.01374731021
whilst this went on porthos arrived with a very cross look on his face and was astonished to find the lieutenant resigned and mousqueton almost merry				26986.334827156043
besides in accepting it she added in a voice full of emotion you render me a much greater service than you imagine this woman is full of mysteries murmured d artagnan to himself				156.76061945330738
sinbad the sailor humph said the major very good				1508.4575050663866
and monsieur d artagnan of whom you spoke just now monsieur d herblay may i ask if you have any news of him we parted from him four days ago and we have reason to believe that he has reached paris before us no sir i am sure he hasn t yet arrived				1951.4040843940081
his eminence took the paper and read in a slow voice dwelling upon every syllable dec				9843.46352130832
the day after my return to lille my brother in his turn succeeded in making his escape i was accused of complicity and was condemned to remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner				1266.6944521793148
40194m business had already been going on for half an hour when he entered				529.4047759317638
say there is no need why dantès should die it would indeed be a pity he should				25618.49014676622
it was like having a spy in the enemy s camp				1440.1161619134525
in madame de villefort s room he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the wall				1062.0882600661919
he jumped out of bed and ran to the window				1131.3830681510226
oh if that were so i should lose my reason and he folded her in his arms				538.5592478157575
then my dear sir i am convinced that these gentlemen return your kind wishes and will be delighted to kill you also				1540.4508288302102
cromwell had sent him to mazarin				301.4616948768975
the young man stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived caderousse sitting at table with danglars under an arbor				6490.15595593436
i opened my eyes astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt a third of the squadron were lying on the ground wounded dead or dying				5184.929997291059
some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt aramis shuddered in spite of himself				399.84651499372535
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep				1040.462988075417
so after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply la ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud				533.1947782590127
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words				912.2561617736535
dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen				1618.8102347016961
now said he that suffices begone which way the way you came you wish me to get out at that window you got in very well oh you have some design against me reverend sir idiot				36182.37497867033

athos cast a glance at his feet hands and hair those three marks of race				12687.987870016104

it is your new master my good fellow said the footman				37016.11999462842
observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of april in the year 1814 were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites				11862.086231739395
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captain s feet				1572.7484414820212
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy				621.2612761917977
the count s eye expanded he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel				3680.191479403207

shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate				21555.348383164535
they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation				9422.421886444474

a regiment of cuirassiers nearly equal as to numbers issued from behind the hill and came full gallop toward it				23.25977366020334

believe me you ought now to take a rest				2306.109367869026
the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal shaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin				22397.477180993406

dantès was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take place would leave him defenceless				62852.49037901957
the moment the little troop passed goskal and were approaching the post a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness and advanced into the middle of the road putting his finger on his lips				537.8881210912841
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart				314.5366300674916
courage cried raoul courage too late murmured the young man too late the water closed above his head and stifled his voice				625.1127381222664

dantès possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical turn of his mind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry				30511.445743429038
the carriage passed under two arched gateways and at length stopped in a court large dark and square				4310.814650440683

porthos succeeded him and thanks to one of those disappearances to which he was accustomed he was able to provide for the wants of all for a fortnight				2949.155169102919
although m de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air				1408.9585029254051

the comb was to be a leaden one because his beard like that of most fair people was rather red he therefore dyed it thus whilst combing it				114.62351389295827

well there sir is another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth and that none but the wicked prosper				28429.164667754754

as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons				8574.640363642993

prorsus admirabile continued aramis but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers				9789.642699105845
yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé s gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays 0327m so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbé for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases you are wrong to speak thus said the abbé and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error what mean you inquired caderousse with a look of surprise				961.4215510192475

the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid				49650.473893538736
he is the evil genius of both of us				474.2097355910475

fernand was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow countrymen found danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor destiny				7130.01348814053

this evening then at a quarter to nine at the gate				1793.6094500136894
athos gave raoul some of the holy water				1313.5254567317938
nevertheless raoul you must go to blois and you must make your excuses and mine to madame de saint remy the youth looked pleased				2384.6366959766583
on the landing d artagnan blushed in the antechamber he trembled				3003.40116908075
if they had discovered milady s retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to béthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends				557.3455607486396
a quarter of an hour later he was at greenwich				2451.3583611202107
d artagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and listened				4485.99769734609
did you hope to escape it because you were four times guilty				1564.36025831226
be kind enough then to send me 500 000 francs tomorrow				2061.4424040905847
at last it seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no one but a prisoner possesses saw that there in all probability the opening must be				1580.684816907906
i understand said monte cristo well acquainted with ali s pantomime you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping chamber ali with considerable animation made a sign in the affirmative				2001.5180673400737

the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrate s study				2548.4624774531103
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one				814.9477871367054
i tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle field you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons				34230.8214477641
twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot				2051.7642402141673
in short it was you who have but now in this chamber seated in this chair i now fill made an engagement with cardinal richelieu to cause the duke of buckingham to be assassinated in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d artagnan milady was livid				11875.34064724502
i i was where d artagnan stands				4885.673488756757
well captain he endeavored twice to get up and fell again twice				1801.4470183603403
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother				1042.9023445151956
coquenard gently advised him to be patient				10896.92630635672
had i been as great a friend of jonah as i am of d artagnan i should have followed him even into the inside of the whale itself and you would have done the same aramis certainly but you make me out better than i am dear count				182.62800849141945
i hope he does not bring our breakfast with him oh no our breakfast comes from my father s kitchen				4670.85600864713
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite				38757.32001887346
after the pope s death and his son s exile it was supposed that the spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal s time but this was not the case				4048.1798690863397
d artagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance				19041.604243442387
the chancellor entered half smiling half blushing				11723.00549349122
i am come to fetch you monsieur d artagnan from whom his eminence sent me tell my lord that i m going to sleep and i advise him as a friend to do the same his eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly the devil take mazarin who does not know when to sleep at the proper time				694.5124090254727
mazarin returned pale and evidently thoughtful				1569.5988310794392
there said the king that consoles me they are not all traitors at this moment winter s voice was raised with the cry of forward the first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the plateau				35032.89175416723
now my work is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor pleasure				1628.833498308486
athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was				1834.6952227472495
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur d herblay and myself to do in your service				1117.6529947028473
the air was soft and clear as it generally is at that early hour of the morning				1100.4219357186298
a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner				1742.2648256003197
oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances are you then a coward cried villefort in a contemptuous voice				318.5388209022944
i again reminded her that you were a friend and that she need not conceal anything from you then said albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners was your first remembrance what is the next oh then i remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade of some sycamore trees on the borders of a lake in the waters of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror				5479.203690184097
villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner				672.8460630702002
thieves might strip the house it would annoy me less than to be disobeyed baptistin bowed				1723.9961318584587
you wish to see blois again it is but natural then you permit me to go you are not angry in your heart exclaimed raoul joyously				192800.3941622314
perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you when i am married no they told you then that m d épinay consented to our all living together yes then why are you still vexed and grieved the old man s eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection				11260.075342497374
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard				1235.2222061939678
in all probability he has replied the valet for i saw the horses harnessed to his eminence s carriage this morning and when i asked where he was going they told me to st germain he is beforehand with us said m de tréville				464.45707399496945
speak doctor i am listening said villefort strike i am prepared for everything madame de saint méran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes				2271.776175633071
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune besides they say i am already rich in right of my mother too rich even				41914.48879722967
d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week				25202.02920615819
he heard her approach and withdraw from the partially open door and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person intercept the light				1574.4780147917797
i am neither an angel nor a demon i am a daughter of earth i am a sister of thy faith that is all yes yes said felton i doubted but now i believe you believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of belial who is called lord de winter				409.3963359774949
this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu				39011.30036332799
and your business is that of a confectioner in the rue des lombards explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots not badly answered i faith said gondy laughing but i have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations well my lord before i became a confectioner i myself was three years sergeant in the piedmontese regiment and before i became sergeant i was for eighteen months the servant of monsieur d artagnan the lieutenant of musketeers asked gondy				1841.157728023901
oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young man				116.03451075292654
i said i wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man				98.99741385452454
i made such haste that i am certain of not having been forestalled				10032.765871215046
still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i can not explain to you				66.40824930241324
but continued morcerf à propos of danglars we have strangely wandered from the subject				1241.3511799802277
with respect to aramis though having the air of having nothing secret about him he was a young fellow made up of mysteries answering little to questions put to him about others and having learned from him the report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a princess wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of his interlocutor				13323.769724207497
and you as for me i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home				2009.5022201698318
i don t comprehend you don t comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me which of my friends my lord your three friends the friends of former days of former days my lord				701.7146769799432
they soon arrived at the silent solitary inn				4200.890940225111
what did he say some parting words to his friends his friends murmured cromwell				3935.8929746645517
if the thing were to do again i would again do it villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement				1931.33103336839
fourteen years had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth his hair had turned white time and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his brow and his look once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person				1524.9598459256454
as for me i will give my last sou for it				28.637130402148077
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg 1 e 1				1753.5708361842142
the lieutenant s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing room but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water				1163.5631399630888
good evening maximilian i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay yes i recognized mademoiselle danglars				455.90911128475085
there is but one way left you that is safe said she it is through my grandfather s room she rose				5416.846281640817
come come continued he patting edmond s shoulder kindly you did very right dantès to follow captain leclere s instructions and touch at elba although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble 0027m how could that bring me into trouble sir asked dantès for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer				40599.50812906394
moderato he cried as they descended				8753.755461606517
they told me the executioner of bethune was here and wounded when you uttered two piercing cries				6577.84158940026
the more so sir as it was men s and not god s doing tell me of those men said the abbé and remember too he added in an almost menacing tone you have promised to tell me everything				738.9468818045026
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room				348.3031147720916
at the same time continued d artagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey yes indeed said porthos				16.550787399052375
d artagnan awakened planchet and ordered him to open it				41.998551754394995
drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all one s wit and cool judgment i drunk said caderousse well that s a good one				705.6906169606427
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair				6261.380887012208
they now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades				10943.081649965747
she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon d artagnan when he spared the life of her brother				1029.0809427943818
i do this oh my god said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine				1154.5329930944179
the fog increased the darkness and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to become rainy				40565.449959257654
do you think i ever sleep then				438.1741040355194
we will escape and if we can not escape we will talk you of those whom you love and i of those whom i love				773.1135329427004
i am saved yes said felton but silence silence				588.0710323907043
every soldier must be ambitious must he not				650.0962309031911
oh death is in my house cried villefort				88.30075459753658
well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in one thing people spoke in this style in 1815 that of not being able to call a day my own not even that of my betrothal and wherefore were you called away just now asked mademoiselle de saint méran with an air of deep interest				3895.087074367103
who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last in spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated his hopes dantès did not lose his presence of mind but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him then half carrying half supporting him he managed to reach the abbé s chamber when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed				1374.9969328999703
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning				1064.312351615508
when a man is a robber it is hard to call him nephew whom he has impoverished when one is a murderer to recognize the man whom one has made an orphan these words produced a contrary effect to that which mordaunt had anticipated				65325.46589310893
only they sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested the instant that he left the trenches to come to the quarters of the musketeers				1024.6696719768684
habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great care				2996.3261841168155
mademoiselle eugénie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance				1455.3822126691175
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse				245.6484580631697
he traversed the island after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and re embarked for marciana				28209.54126981909
the second operation was as successful as the first la jeune amélie was in luck				31043.93449567066
but it is probable said the light horseman that they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion yes that s probable said d artagnan				1.51048495760966
i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival				3263.642102356257
the conversation took place in english a language which d artagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage				1738.767447950768

madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted				28706.510614044717

gloves of gray kid matching the hat well displayed the form of a slender and elegant hand whilst his boots similar in color to the hat and gloves confined feet small as those of a boy twelve years old				2071.1257282542815
high heads expose themselves from afar and the cardinal is longsighted well said porthos in the first place make a bargain with the mercer and a good bargain that s useless said d artagnan for i believe if he does not pay us we shall be well enough paid by another party at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs the door was thrown violently open and the unfortunate mercer rushed into the chamber in which the council was held				7738.264852172798

a little before they came to fromelles the storm burst				26700.15832563763
but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered				745.4666022065485
danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the other and was about to cut up the fowl				4097.613692655686
that was not the appointed hour				1215.5593653968126
fly then cried mademoiselle d armilly whose pity returned as her fears diminished fly or kill yourself said eugénie in a tone which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary				2338.557136032611
did you observe that man s eyes while he was speaking to us no but have you ever watched him carefully doubtless he is capricious but that is all one thing alone struck me of all the exquisite things he placed before us he touched nothing				509.37371099510887

your voice is that of a young man i do not know my age for i have not counted the years i have been here				917.355045888798

have you forgotten my lord that it is he who answered for me to the queen since then monsieur de beaufort has become an enemy of the state that may be my lord but since i am neither king nor queen nor minister he is not my enemy and i can not accept your offer this then is what you call devotion				12613.608952759152
it does not appear to be very clean in the crossroads d artagnan glanced down at his boots all covered with mud but that same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer and it might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap				33101.5780364639
the cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than ever				2650.0271717660303

andrea s hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time				829.7319646989712

then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of aramis and grimaud				832.9516405647544
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too				2174.476299697615
the man of meung chapter xv				9473.699793104264
that continued the cardinal arose not only from a feeling of natural equity but likewise from a plan i have marked out with respect to you d artagnan became more and more astonished				1981.47272897902
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat 6				51827.47522228325
on seeing him d artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise				936.9727767712635
the apparition as the procureur had told madame danglars valentine was not yet recovered				3155.2522696668307
my god have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful cry barrois fell back as if he had been struck by lightning				1770.1454300877376
it was no longer a rival who was beloved it was himself who was apparently beloved				37245.11909002217
the king half dressed the queen and laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and waiting				8518.71827729875
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet d artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant				1301.5441029503763
you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough				1867.1996820443737
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing				26912.44466851507
who knows when i shall be at liberty that i may not satisfy your curiosity and will you make the same promise to my love cried d artagnan beside himself with joy				496.69817116256496
more than that we shall have a tempest or i don t know what s what you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon luckily the captain understood his business				9958.156010286039
what is his name count albert it is the same man whom i rescued from the hands of the banditti at rome in what language would you like me to converse with him monte cristo turned to albert				289.46187225178363
if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything ah maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both i will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and unjust				12343.690796617435
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling				4660.253046483153
i am at least fearful of it				95.30176402981937
morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry				38345.696459230276
porthos aramis and d artagnan followed his example				1940.6817005445846
fifty vessels were waiting to set out				401.8927663792165
the sellers of moccoletti entered on the scene				1766.0067307870988
you appear to forget yourself sadly no sir said albert coldly there are circumstances in which one can not except through cowardice i offer you that refuge refuse to admit certain persons at least what is your errand then with me sir i mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplace i mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes that will be sufficient where two men having met one of them will remain on the ground danglars turned pale cavalcanti moved a step forward and albert turned towards him				13.20267605395429
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately				2766.829828597617
if it were so with m morrel unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m morrel can not give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it how so he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six months				2085.3870073732114

that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today				2754.5675481320022
mademoiselle eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel				27565.4250455267
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved				30553.200794797856
first one gun l goes under then the other				670.7155496890656
all is well we may sleep tranquilly on this assurance the two friends fell asleep and d artagnan who was very weary bade good night to grimaud and laid himself down in his cloak with naked sword at his side in such a manner that his body barricaded the passage and it should be impossible to enter the room without upsetting him				24.610106367239187
where does your highness wish to go to some elevated spot whence i can look down on lens and the surrounding country in that case i m your man i can trust you you are a true frenchman i am an old soldier of rocroy my lord here said the prince handing him a purse here is for rocroy				37576.957493473135
canst thou speak any patois i can do something better than that sir i can speak flemish where the devil didst thou learn it in artois where i fought for years				2260.378559397949
proof of this crime will be found on arresting him for the letter will be found upon him or at his father s or in his cabin on board the pharaon very good resumed danglars now your revenge looks like common sense for in no way can it revert to yourself and the matter will thus work its own way there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am doing and write upon it to the king s attorney and that s all settled and danglars wrote the address as he spoke				11944.899140775206
oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other and which of them made this passage oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbé was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea blind fools murmured the count				231.27794328639598
i defended the king and who told you to defend the king the comte de la fere himself yes the king but to day you have not fought for the king you have fought for mazarin which is not quite the same thing but you yourself oh for me that is another matter				1243.0677567789069
albert passed his hand through his hair and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance followed the count into the room the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves				4903.088455474428
all is ready for to morrow evening				747.5707267069488
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat				935.8332789036084
he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four and twenty hours				2129.5962909913637
now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations				32873.27907338453
i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musketoon				67870.94748652415
i understand now why they murdered him valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold				111573.87934475784
mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him				12.291456863233114
when i first came here being the last comer it was for me to make the first advances				33438.69444293416
what do you say maximilian asked valentine				211.16265386084453
the same flower of innocence had flourished or was still flourishing on their brow that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house 40120m villefort shrieked clasped his hands and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air				1593.0154345893286
next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact with the names of the victim and the murderer				8079.579499600299
follow me then said the abbé as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès				818.9371456442135
oh oh he at length muttered do you see what				708.1398628880142
while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone				3187.079308070798
but you said that your name was d artagnan who i yes you somebody said to me you are monsieur d artagnan i answered you think so my guards exclaimed that they were sure of it				77.29767514479086
d artagnan porthos and aramis rose and in one spontaneous motion rushed to their swords				2568.224975487216
has this woman been relating her crimes to you				50.815888243864244
it is not necessary for milady to be seen by this fellow continued the stranger				3080.7767935455677
his musketeers proceeded and followed him				17.581765205018936
you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations				6188.952965932746
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant				1472.5995890913803

what are you thinking about said the king go on my good parry unless you are tired parry resumed his reading				12516.833682544417
to the wall to the wall and the four friends seconded by grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and detaching itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch				22362.75157332525
however i m glad not to fight them until to morrow				13098.328009279712
the vision had fled and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb they had vanished at his waking				44321.553796615895
let me look at you and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her looks				2747.9909355297664
if you deprive me of that take away my life also we are forbidden to shed your blood and by whom are you forbidden by him we obey you do then obey someone yes a chief i thought you said you were the chief so i am of these men but there is another over me and did your superior order you to treat me in this way yes but my purse will be exhausted probably come said danglars will you take a million no two millions three four				8179.334223068235
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d artagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m de tréville s private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl				28991.23442828963
they have vexed you and you are angry the paralytic closed his eyes in token of assent				1892.4554694415428
an overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury				7777.246794755783
if it were bad money there might be some hopes but unfortunately those were all good pieces manage the matter as well as you can my good man it does not concern me the more so as i have not a livre left come said d artagnan let us inquire further				24213.013128065126
oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular				46556.26688642884
go to him with this letter and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done upon which m d artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son kissed him tenderly on both cheeks and gave him his benediction				26566.10093599474
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls				6652.8534523921635
i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me				43.04624403720652
but in a word what are you going to do asked she				331.3827841080341
now let us everyone retire to his own home said d artagnan as if he had done nothing but command all his life and attention				1099.6141603557314
i thought he was up to something it s a misfortune to which his friend the devil treats us said aramis				16.652586756488027
still more he has lifted the corner of her mask that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong				5807.405489683982
first madame who are you who am i				1868.8992432248938
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but misfortune it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud				21291.68888839975
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know				1200.8707440562077
nevertheless one day when monsieur de beaufort was walking in the meadow his fire was put out his charcoal all removed taken away and thus his means of drawing utterly destroyed				3042.521857734667

this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore				4891.1046379276095
oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his hair oh who will deliver me from this man				308.4473518735694
the count by any opening from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressing room would be able to defend his property himself				456.4324623783919
anne s head was bent down she had not seen the italian s smile but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up				616.0807180365213
why did not the countess the proud mercédès the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour ah baron baron said albert you are not listening what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you oh don t worry about me sir mocker said danglars then turning to monte cristo he said but will you undertake to speak to the father willingly if you wish it but let it be done explicitly and positively				34327.78375065823
nothing and indeed i am mad to trouble you with such things when your coming to my tent at such an hour announces that you are the bearers of important news yes my lord said athos i wish to speak to the king to the king				663.2435810266203
for you monsieur said planchet presenting the billet to the young man				119.84321069372702
perhaps that famous barony will have something to do with our interview this evening				652.147253753805
come my dear bazin tell me where he is didn t you hear me tell you monsieur d artagnan that i don t know where he is yes certainly but to that i answer that it is impossible it is nevertheless the truth monsieur the pure truth the truth of the good god d artagnan saw clearly that he would get nothing out of this man who was evidently telling a falsehood in his pretended ignorance of the abode of aramis but whose lies were bold and decided				5449.697346666537
i possess nearly 50 000 livres in right of my mother my grandfather and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de saint méran will leave me as much and m noirtier evidently intends making me his heir				5490.533552024304
only i say that if i were named madame de montpensier or the queen marie de médicis i should use less precautions than i take being simply called milady clarik that is just said richelieu				1954.3131387565063
if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the rest down my throat				2828.571044268678

the story has been told by the corsican to some priest who in his turn has repeated it				36.43073298444498
in fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a fever				8511.43409105815
the old man s declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless dear m noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward de villefort the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred				4622.223095018604
aramis contented himself by making a sign with his head				454.1171816964782
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve				52053.00349897552

then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden				1341.4637241836806

if he comes out we shall catch him				19.884691812609066

but touching these spanish affairs i think that the baroness did not dream the whole of the don carlos matter				1160.1183155761037
he then repaired to d artagnan who thanks to his four trusses of straw was in the act of making up and tasting by anticipation the luxury of a bed so soft so well stuffed at the head so well covered at the foot that it would have excited the envy of the king himself if his majesty had not been fast asleep in his own				1014.4442985557909
whose is the ocean upon which we look				1187.0420484458546

the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them				55.292861538169745
in one second athos joined him				15.197458734068434

why the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each other my lord cried the queen you forget that i have never said that i love you but you have never told me that you did not love me and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an ingratitude				25043.923381313965

dantès had not been deceived he had reached the first of the two islands which was in fact tiboulen				55931.27833745939

but will you not go up pass on before me i beg of you as the late cardinal used to say to the late king only to show you the way sire and aramis ascended the ladder quickly and reached the window in an instant				1560.9721203140357
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian				52371.08201459891

d artagnan had just passed the rue cassette and already perceived the door of his friend s house shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it when he perceived something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni				4819.575311159565
and that being conducted to the scaffold resumed the queen oh my lord				602.3587253020784
the place royale be it so replied athos				13.905396634454933

but i excuse it it is impossible to expect the son of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven a deep crimson suffused the countenance of villefort				606.2204680908228
in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the one with green the other with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbage leaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate				9714.524453423648

come said andrea you are a man void of compassion i ll have you turned out this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh				1112.8100469815035
madame de villefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room				391.70651257666907
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying				12741.668729843128
and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him				18.54885846530444

0159m owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that moment we will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderation but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès				295.2485587317533

from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple a cabbage for instance				16632.06272222035

dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed				50144.794174646035
hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain				3679.8966760676694
oh you are a man of god sir cried caderousse for no one knew that edmond had given you this diamond and you might have kept it which said the abbé to himself you would have done the abbé rose took his hat and gloves				5002.354375495648

at length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him				99.677755647925

from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh				1240.5706798483347
during the three weeks that he has been with me i have only had to reproach him with one thing being too severe with the prisoners and who is this cerberus a certain monsieur grimaud my lord and what was he before he went to vincennes he was in the country as i was told by the person who recommended him to me and who recommended this man to you the steward of the duc de grammont he is not a gossip i hope lord a mercy my lord				632.9707384737383
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time				736.0200235129206
the change that had come over villefort during the examination the destruction of the letter the exacted promise the almost supplicating tones of the magistrate who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory				5204.821163952535

if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefort s valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness				19854.233213380125
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brows				9125.11570302893

we have accomplished more difficult things than that				717.7972401185395
nonsense let us break open the door and if he is too far gone in his madness well we will kill him softly gentlemen said d artagnan drawing his pistols from his belt you will kill nobody if you please good good cried the calm voice of athos from the other side of the door let them just come in these devourers of little children and we shall see brave as they appeared to be the two english gentlemen looked at each other hesitatingly				14541.703803891318
a keeper reiterated the duke there was nothing wanting in my collection except this gallows bird				3964.028399884851

besides continued the young man if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth well said monte cristo in an indifferent tone you will do as you please count for you are the master of your own actions and are the person most concerned in the matter but if i were you i would not divulge a word of these adventures				37391.85516274

it is the declaration of cardinal spada and the will so long sought for replied edmond still incredulous				33974.73698488906
d artagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others				1559.1086880269122
milady on the contrary was quite conversant with all aristocratic intrigues amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years				2521.327906955528

how very astonishing cried he at length				6533.490281754556

my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious				13567.109826303786
because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the gates on your honor is that true cried albert				113.57315279986568

i made them but you know my dear friend madame du vallon porthos in pronouncing these words seemed to gulp down something				5271.268937760329
the man went silently to each of the candles and blew them out one after the other				654.3314110927196
two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them				158.95545720735788

the two men were left alone				780.6676962029202
that s the thing replied the gascon				1225.5488529438865
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face				749.7665892929964
then continued the host i replied that as from the moment we seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to payment i hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the favor of his custom to my brother host of the golden eagle but monsieur porthos replied that my house being the best he should remain where he was				1788.512516298908

anne of austria opened the door to him herself				805.3400651246159
felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would see				1213.412597608315
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight				1869.4839360238875
i once endeavored to go down with two of my servants but he flew into terrible rage				1586.0771279924918
coward he is a coward indeed grumbled the host drawing near to d artagnan and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before				744.9563274998428
d artagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think				8323.366589637812
the king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him				24.694461061283665
if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter				2241.6644490816616
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing				42736.4499803913
by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune oh that depends upon circumstances				9707.615599955378
these 900 000 francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased				3160.944565116004
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere				8738.008181087278
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes				10379.303810253969
d artagnan would have preferred money in hand to all that fine talk for he knew well that to mazarin it was easy to promise and hard to perform				87720.86754951427

but that which completed the almost masculine look morcerf found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are placed just at the corner of her mouth and the effect tended to increase the expression of self dependence that characterized her countenance				959.5419467561965

at the bottom of his heart he had often had a feeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so and he laid the request of number 34 before the governor but the latter sapiently imagined that dantès wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request				14148.35969007177

i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness				2608.315387426184
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement				26847.43507999327
what though she has lost her own mother at a tender age she has had the happiness to find a second mother in madame de villefort the world however is mistaken my father abandons me from utter indifference while my stepmother detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile hate you sweet valentine exclaimed the young man how is it possible for anyone to do that alas replied the weeping girl i am obliged to own that my stepmother s aversion to me arises from a very natural source her overweening love for her own child my brother edward but why should it i do not know but though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation i will just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and i much fear she envies me the fortune i enjoy in right of my mother and which will be more than doubled at the death of m and mme				347.63908092476635

it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations				3199.058906243223
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all				783.4320784596333

the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters				2954.6644367262993
yes i received the news this evening by a courier				6266.374899502843

for life replied porthos in the same manner				719.6804931266594
oh he said he is mad and as though he feared that the walls of the accursed house would crumble around him he rushed into the street for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done				1749.2156387417822
she was a tall woman with a slender figure and a forest of golden curls such as raphael was fond of and titian has painted all his magdalens with				2255.6496726158753

madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm				2554.5993314712846
until to morrow evening you are not at your own disposal let it be then the day after to morrow said aramis				20.250740223314114

the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past				2198.4419601830687
he clapped his hands three times the ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an echo				11119.757157903096
i know that it is terrible said d artagnan but when i reflect that we have killed english rochellais spaniards nay even french who never did us any other harm but to aim at and to miss us whose only fault was to cross swords with us and to be unable to ward off our blows i can on my honor find an excuse for my share in the murder of that woman as for me said porthos now that you have reminded me of it athos i have the scene again before me as if i now were there				555.3063795426691

melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world i have been in ill luck for several days said danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news ah indeed said monte cristo				6.265692315350465
then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds				3517.9381374942745
this time there could be no doubt d artagnan was really insulted				39536.74347371485
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell				2989.421811910715
he therefore hastened to the palace to congratulate the queen on the battle of lens determined beforehand to act with or against the court as his congratulations were well or ill received				3008.3460951958386

nevertheless aramis was in a good situation and able to defend himself				125.84398852943853

this confirmed milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather royalist than cardinalist				17551.25180374849
i knight you monsieur le comte then turning to aramis he said it is now your turn monsieur le chevalier the same ceremony recommenced with the same words whilst winter unlaced his leather cuirass that he might disguise himself like the king				825.3503102824152
mazarin made a grimace as if he meant to say but he does not wear the cardinal s cap then he added so my friend it s your opinion that monsieur de beaufort will escape that s my idea my lord and if your eminence were to offer to make me at this moment governor of the castle of vincennes i should refuse it				22.18521400379386

i sometimes wonder replied athos smiling at that gayety which recalled the good old days that we could form an association of men who would be after twenty years of separation still so closely bound together				1241.7833585239873

this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars				167.80246358264972
ah said mordaunt with a sneer there s one who is afraid zounds exclaimed d artagnan bounding toward him who says that athos is afraid let him have his say d artagnan said athos with a smile of sadness and contempt				1113.6721225159838

calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen the abbé opened it and displayed to the dazzled eyes of caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship				8088.098330065842
d artagnan thought it was proper to follow this example				2055.7049299852774
sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords but it was too late				3242.59229463761
it s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health my health is well enough said fernand clenching his hands without raising his head				411.9259111444565
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her chamber				825.3432262742799
well asked the president what is your decision 40206m i have no reply to make said the count in a low tone				951.315065081195

yes you see i am as exact as you are				1605.5624344613336
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment				6310.688108089024
he sent one of his servants to m de la trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the cardinal s guardsmen from his house and to reprimand his people for their audacity in making sortie against the king s musketeers				820.508851064994

let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives				7881.0288978164235
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical				29383.28648968889
at the end of the piece étienne entered and announced to eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits				4311.970028057641
aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion				16652.314406397345
dantès remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abbé was mad such a conviction would be so terrible				2762.3437985615005
just so why he is a second ariosto no his name is the count of monte cristo there is no count of monte cristo said debray				221.61282664599878
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone				1699.6385841468937
at the expiration of ten minutes felton came				1314.5154432529343
at ten o clock anne of austria had entered the king s room				308.5807815220323
tis raoul who is come home athos as the name of raoul was pronounced looked inquisitively at d artagnan in order to see if any curiosity was painted on his face				610.4817908520077
morrel you are going to destroy yourself indeed count said morrel shuddering what has put this into your head i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hands				334.95072799615815
those two words your mass and a simple glance cast upon felton revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her this reply ready arranged presented itself to her lips i said she with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she had remarked in the voice of the young officer i sir				554.9786653746711
a bad relapse that will lead you if i mistake not to the place de grève				35621.38527767812
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne				6938.738992993198
then rising in despair he exclaimed the chief the chief here i am said vampa instantly appearing what do you want take my last gold muttered danglars holding out his pocket book and let me live here i ask no more for liberty i only ask to live then you suffer a great deal oh yes yes cruelly still there have been men who suffered more than you i do not think so yes those who have died of hunger danglars thought of the old man whom in his hours of delirium he had seen groaning on his bed				1445.9180799298888
monsieur d artagnan he cried falling back a step it is monsieur d artagnan				5.327167198379063

gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this house yes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice				447.10424879088237
a part of the good abbé s words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home				1953.5696327030594
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false he has just written to me but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence laporte detained in england as everyone else had been by the orders of charles i arrived and was the bearer of the duke s dying gift to the queen				411.8031659477869
mazarin after this half humble half gallant attention went away				662.0504607973862
at this moment planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont				80259.02745905679
you will tell him in order that he may not doubt that he came there in the costume of the great mogul which the chevalier de guise was to have worn and that he purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles well monseigneur all the details of his coming into and going out of the palace on the night when he introduced himself in the character of an italian fortune teller you will tell him that he may not doubt the correctness of my information that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with black tears death s heads and crossbones for in case of a surprise he was to pass for the phantom of the white lady who as all the world knows appears at the louvre every time any great event is impending is that all monseigneur tell him also that i am acquainted with all the details of the adventure at amiens that i will have a little romance made of it wittily turned with a plan of the garden and portraits of the principal actors in that nocturnal romance i will tell him that tell him further that i hold montague in my power that montague is in the bastille that no letters were found upon him it is true but that torture may make him tell much of what he knows and even what he does not know exactly then add that his grace has in the precipitation with which he quit the isle of ré forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain letter from madame de chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen inasmuch as it proves not only that her majesty can love the enemies of the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of france				479.1676212015534
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground				1211.9501996107363
but there was more difficulty in arousing porthos				188.6018781547065
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber				14345.379806624913
here it is eleven o clock				763.3843142407691
to have to make a false excuse to porthos				91.86787558857475

said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously				35481.76621262732
the woman is an agent of the cardinal he has agents then throughout the world cried d artagnan				1.570548274003275
athos was the first to leave him in order that he might retire to a little property he had inherited near blois porthos the second to marry an attorney s wife and lastly aramis the third to take orders and become an abbé				861.8447627211114

well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end				1504.9141419450636
he insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from monsieur de conti or monsieur de beaufort or monsieur de bouillon or monsieur d elbeuf or the coadjutor or madame de longueville or broussel or the parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance				3413.4343527411706
there may be an ambuscade concealed in this wood did you see nothing there asked the count				242.2720535883134

i have the price and d artagnan threw the bag upon the table				586.9501650465687
the gascon therefore instead of answering growled out ja				74818.70076970449
monsieur de comminges he said pardon me we both are servants of the queen are we not				692.5615861708017
he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten o clock struck				1075.8690958241643
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch				23559.256831839662
the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first				2515.8875342319193
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover				3530.4609815628064
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window				1070.4999910840093
i think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality				28926.168403668347
franz fell powerless on a chair villefort opened the door and escaped for the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the heart of this terrible old man				192.9073250075612
sure of what that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself what lord ruthven do you mean why our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in paris to be sure why not and you visit him meet him at your own house and elsewhere i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m de château renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa what of that why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner oh yes and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner to be sure i remember it all now he called himself vampa				2155.2911852958136
can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities he resolved to end his anxiety				1214.0515404094285
how long will this fuse burn asked this person				1324.7968882914995
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole				2152.8958674619616
his face was hidden under the wide brim of his hat				934.1119309955662
ah this time you can not lose ground my fine friend exclaimed d artagnan				1.4626443317061952
there she must always be and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful you are difficult to please viscount yes for i often wish for what is impossible what is that to find such a wife as my father found monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificent pistols				2452.7930195456424
he recognized the place where he had awaked by the bed of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto				5465.196715653412
30065m but i remember it perfectly interposed the darling edward				3658.830479563899
he was perhaps about to regain his liberty at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity				2030.1553876486494
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him				24.760496409390836
sometimes in the midst of dinner when everyone under the attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation believed they had two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table aramis looked at his watch arose with a bland smile and took leave of the company to go as he said to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment				6735.924466186891
what is this said aramis on seeing them arrive				3501.3434732125256
they are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency desired				14725.947208550195
see him there cold as marble and proud like his father				624.3489357529679
at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams				3568.641334250179
d artagnan was radiant with joy and pride				7685.50297379037
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all oh cried the executioner all				613.9258720412195
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes				2321.913399343715
but under the present circumstances i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old man who because he hated the father vents his anger on the son				1107.499487048241
to any one not acquainted with him he seemed to be in his normal condition but to his friends to athos and aramis was apparent a certain feverishness in his gayety				7825.524678752822
why didn t the baron come himself demanded buckingham				963.6838668257526
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival				5502.217413124705
did you pass through the corso yes well did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask and one with white damask with a red cross				4581.243042633597

he had nothing more to do now but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones towards him one by one				524.174480971512
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory				14188.89643246304
milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her maid				3547.4169249455886
what had especially been observed by the two friends was the little interest taken by the court of france in the terrible events which had occurred in england which they thought should have arrested the attention of all europe				4245.912701634269
albert besides being an elegant well looking young man was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was a viscount a recently created one certainly but in the present day it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical tree is equally estimated whether dated from 1399 or merely 1815 but to crown all these advantages albert de morcerf commanded an income of 50 000 livres a more than sufficient sum to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris				532.0899496855259
she had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago				3570.064206257748
how sir she cried as d artagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me				27.023031214532566

no from you yes you thoroughly understand me sir				460.4841529422476
and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything do you then really suffer asked morrel quickly				1247.3999258074389
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky				5677.255527662958

dantès noticed that the captain of la jeune amélie had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much noise can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so				647.7180081810757

something more terrible more fatal more alarming for us the child was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it madame danglars uttered a piercing cry and seizing villefort s hands exclaimed my child was alive said she you buried my child alive				3509.259494928261
but don t fancy that i am going to take you on your bare word				1165.178816367469
this excess of bilious humor could not be attributed to play for unlike porthos who accompanied the variations of chance with songs or oaths athos when he won remained as unmoved as when he lost				1211.6347057049948
in dying i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron eo rus and all will be over but come franz take courage your wife is an heiress indeed beauchamp you are unbearable				15309.963107962496

then the iron hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept				4681.05451160798
what will come out of those three elements when i am no longer present to combine them				156.10219412734742

but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally				5636.2290911533155
you are there sir he said respectfully				26726.62775951782
well what do you wish me to do for you said beauchamp mildly				89408.3632380316
m de boville said nothing but nodded his head and took up the portfolio				10995.533741171601
a deathlike silence reigned in the room above				10193.363879588776
the expulsion took place and i pocketed 600 000 francs the day charles v repassed the bidassoa				21685.307983824503
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by edmond in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded				22945.045620086934
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated				7128.4497261785245
alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful crime				2005.7380866541303

you are a faithful friend felton felton took back the weapon and laid it upon the table as he had agreed with the prisoner				1312.197665930637
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity				1351.2534445263052
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed the young man is right let the prisoner be brought in meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was				1657.724788869952
no cried d artagnan no steel				4623.4134340350665
it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmond s admiration of him but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there				744.4378826138882
well exclaimed franz and the sailors in unison				19358.313916154126
it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till i give the signal then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in french comte de la fere are you there yes your majesty he answered trembling				56772.31345109657
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real interrupted the count smiling				783.6988525117539
then i confess curiosity mingled with hatred i wished to see what villefort was going to do there and i remained motionless holding my breath				3567.87566904347
at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger				2218.3485866794204
ah yes it is true murmured d avrigny				649.1594965513046

let us save ourselves at these words she passed her arm under that of d artagnan and urged him forward eagerly				1801.2503188151015
the beggar the evening passed on madame de villefort expressed a desire to return to paris which madame danglars had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced				4001.9788087738575
this niece comes sometimes to see her uncle and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that i was and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage ah				497.44431640220745
franz had been to announce the ceremony and madame de villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting him the death of m de saint méran and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the count whom she wished every happiness				3439.1171849303105
your hand athos and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of affection m de tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all his might without perceiving that athos whatever might be his self command allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him and if possible grew paler than he was before				845.1256071495295
he took his army to the priest s where they devoured as much provision as would have lasted him for two months and to the cornet s who performed wonders but as planchet said people do not eat at once for all time even when they eat a good deal d artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal and a half for his companions as the breakfast at the priest s could only be counted as half a repast in return for the feasts which athos porthos and aramis had procured him				28.274576747552032
however he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night				534.9703387182536
morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your knees on your knees he is our benefactor the saviour of our father				904.6145537030216
felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the door				229.44617455762554
now d herblay said athos dismount and come here aramis dismounted and went to porthos whilst athos approached d artagnan				1.633297055276813

tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of ante room				496.0335578492246
will you sell him to me for that sum no but i will play for him what at dice no sooner said than done and i lost the horse				1028.894492154862
felton took advantage of this moment and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle				3303.7602938653135
ali mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared				682.3659524309523
grimaud is the man whom a friend has sent to second me in everything				594.5509504925491

he would have written or at this instant someone knocked at the door				249.71539416053682
d artagnan and planchet took each a post horse and a postillion rode before them				108.31434624986991
we have seen in what state of mind he listened to the murmurs from below which even reached him in his seclusion and to the guns the firing of which resounded through that room				470.22760283414846

the abbé the abbé murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering				11026.658683419031
giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord for in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness d artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible				1432.33496392204
here said he i want to show you the kind of passport which i have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life i consent to leave you then turning his eyes from milady to the paper he read order to conduct the name is blank interrupted lord de winter				406.6832822090843

he desired kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was and that he would be obedient to her orders				1429.8523982776676
this strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the allées de meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the truth				1960.2246471945857
the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair				1655.8492872332959
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london				10160.210465591143
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you				68.62414021669329
that s all right said the man hop in and we re off				643.5759599503572
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo				22.98542402929983
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back				673.3634527569433
gad replied d artagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same again whilst all this was going on athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st antoine				15196.74640736507
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him				30.856576345663026
and how did he treat you with more of mildness than severity did you tell him your whole story i did and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape				20162.68038239078
we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke				20063.474767994547
the horse started brushed against the imprudent man who thought by his strength alone to stay the tempest and he fell against the wall				1050.2642970516608
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still				9245.076586787105
it is nearly eight o clock and at nine i expect a visit				1590.5349656956055

with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet				2935.622868124213
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example				2479.770529895568
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation				2332.125116884958
uncertainty is worse than all go on with the lights said the inspector				1512.955435704117
the escape was fixed to take place at seven o clock there was therefore three quarters of an hour to wait				3714.294377108917
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door				200.43020083756122
tréville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships				10378.739612487281

the quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition carmela alone objecting to it but the count of san felice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded				22806.68816618717
this circumstance pleased m de tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m de la trémouille s testimony and himself				369.056660546202
as soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river but the water was icy cold				2020.89583934747

porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at d artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship				9876.091959816158
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles to lose them even to the gold embroidered belt for gala days win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half a line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and agreeable				2993.935394762824

to be a great chemist in the east one must direct chance and this is to be achieved madame de villefort was in deep thought yet listened attentively				25118.695372131795
d artagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung				9395.905867714555
on perceiving monte cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love				871.3937295704932

at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around				1584.0673992821346
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken shall i send word to him as coming from you yes certainly shall i tell him that he can count on you to the end and you will leave the command to him of the war yes but in politics you must know it is not his element he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinal s hat in my own fashion you care about it then so much since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing				1043.4375707886416

you are then in possession of 900 000 francs asked the notary				2004.9243464760793
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel				10892.718310960914
madame said he i bear to your majesty a letter from my friend the count de guiche who told me he had the honor of being your servant this letter contains important news and the expression of his respect at the name of the count de guiche a blush spread over the cheeks of the young princess and the queen glanced at her with some degree of severity				5850.386465299776

the king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of monsieur and the queen				489.73075597362816
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination				3604.047001833046
once a soldier what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without fortune with nothing but a half ruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my father to my mother and by my mother to me				52.1616033803199
well pardieu there is yours my dear friend replied d artagnan				1.4000976031161523
where is he waiting below in my carriage seek him at once i hasten to do so the duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man his really sincere royalism made him youthful again				386.4397373137661
really that demoiselle d aubigne is very charming so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished				10670.772984352605
well she said at length do you not answer me i have but one question to ask you what do you intend to do i was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating heart				179.07482679323908
the coward who feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace for like all galley slaves you said i may escape from prison i can not from the grave and you said truly the way was opened for you unexpectedly				12254.548093953907
comte de la fere the man cried out chevalier d herblay				6597.8518468017965
the young man s finger glided over the words but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign				2009.567379188523
you remain in london said porthos				19.495977612890186
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else woman woman why do you have such ideas cried caderousse or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man what do you mean added caderousse				338.65460909779057

but continued monte cristo you are not in your usual spirits i have a dreadful headache said albert				110.39805352726974
now sir said albert if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your hand				356.2666591266988
now monsieur de chavigny is not amiable i allow but monsieur du tremblay is considerably worse indeed exclaimed the duke who from time to time looked at the clock the fingers of which seemed to move with sickening slowness				24196.900743919905
you must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it				192.03598959954468
m beauchamp it holds four very well will you accompany us thank you i have just returned from sea what				1199.2764845091267
but don t let us hinder you mousqueton go and perform your master s orders				1634.2716076047786
then he bowed a second time and retired				1395.7152684766263
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when monte cristo went one evening to pay m danglars a visit				1698.52295965289
god doubtless neither heard nor saw me and i sank upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death				525.4870877969682
you would love me as much if i were poor would you not maximilian oh i shall always love you				54.12467017113599
it seems that he is a spaniard				8748.956544240884
what do you say m cavalcanti ah said he we have at pisa ugolino s tower at ferrara tasso s prison at rimini the room of francesca and paolo yes but you have not this little staircase said monte cristo opening a door concealed by the drapery				4805.04077290618
larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman				23630.114460909706
he looked for his doublet of the year 1648 and as he had orderly habits he found it hanging on its nail				19995.053638189125
come instantly pray come madame madame cried valentine calling her step mother and running upstairs to meet her come quick quick and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you what is the matter said madame de villefort in a harsh and constrained tone				710.4651355983599
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed				1988.4332780616248
the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited				2411.276164326736
as to the monk without withdrawing the poniard from the wound he ran to the window opened it leaped out into the flowers of a small garden glided onward to the stable took out his mule went out by a back gate ran to a neighbouring thicket threw off his monkish garb took from his valise the complete habiliment of a cavalier clothed himself in it went on foot to the first post secured there a horse and continued with a loose rein his journey to paris				517.7021820827251
what more do you want and she fell full length on the floor				1223.8891492750672
tell the king that if he sleeps badly to night he will sleep better to morrow night these blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter				1543.1761921778589
i hope i am not the cause hush said andrea				356.18359691336735
yes yes replied dantès eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé				478.9985721827538
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale light just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his hands and countenance				982.4584380592654
i spurred on and found myself in the enemy s ranks and the prince was pleased with you he told me so at least sir when he desired me to return to paris with monsieur de chatillon who was charged to carry the news to the queen and to bring the colors we had taken				3069.2167130884823
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat				1674.1173391908558
this manoeuvre transparent to the duc de beaufort was quite unintelligible to la ramee				991.049626519432
la ramee made one movement in order to satisfy his conscience				2747.727568969174
the vicomte and myself will go and find a priest go sir replied the tutor but in heaven s name do not expose yourself to danger do not fear				1390.677675904353
porthos bowed as if in assent				1614.0306974972698
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended				1604.462655839117
release broussel she cried never at this moment steps were heard in the ante room and without any announcement the marechal de la meilleraie appeared at the door				297.488746142932
at the sixth cabaret then as we said d artagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him				57.48382812784956
we are betrayed said the king in a low voice				837.1716324343862
my lord fronde is the name the discontented give to their party and what is the origin of this name it seems that some days since councillor bachaumont remarked at the palace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys slinging qui frondent stones from the moats round paris young urchins who run off the moment the constable appears only to return to their diversion the instant his back is turned				2791.249524277756
i would lay a wager he has stolen it do you think so answered d artagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity				52148.94977034666
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty				2663.044113621011
a strange incomprehensible unearthly sound seemed to pervade the whole city one felt that something unusual and terrible was happening in all the streets now dark as ocean s most unfathomable caves				3603.79610321127
in that case and supposing he was at liberty he was to rejoin her in france at the convent of the carmelites at béthune				2191.180880516081
raoul had offered some opposition at first but d artagnan made use of the comte de la fere s name and after paying a visit to madame de chevreuse raoul started to rejoin the army				2508.8565217879714
but where is your master he is following me the servitor opened the gate and walked before planchet who made a sign to d artagnan				4.358015059701358
but felton that s another thing				2060.529425020249
i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you if you prefer another name it but you can easily conceive that surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion i desire your presence in paris to be unknown i go sir said mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered				645.2143309719644
moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart				494.5044058802466
oh cried madame de villefort it is really frightful madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard				1128.9849029971685
that is true said the duke and it is to this person i am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude you have said my lord for truly at this moment when there is question of war i confess to you that i see nothing in your grace but an englishman and consequently an enemy whom i should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at windsor or the corridors of the louvre all which however will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life if there be need of it to accomplish it but i repeat it to your grace without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what i did for you in the first we say proud as a scotsman murmured the duke of buckingham				829.5618539155123
one thing only perplexed edmond and destroyed his theory				6824.4179140790275
besides with these men s clothes will you dress here certainly shall you have time do not be uneasy you little coward				2859.438909729377
she will be the sooner with her mother				1011.5808272983315
an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall				1193.0952266551074
great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us ah monsieur stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i have had how sirrah				36034.23339739504
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces				11116.576224919057
yes here it is who is this athos one of my friends but if he should be at home and see me he is not at home and i will carry away the key after having placed you in his apartment but if he should return oh he won t return and if he should he will be told that i have brought a woman with me and that woman is in his apartment but that will compromise me sadly you know of what consequence				8434.331724804608
one would think we had tipped the wink what could i do said porthos				40.46633717153331
gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach				28899.615142082836
they both stood in amazement at the door				253.12599945621895
the morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence pardieu and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted				8148.285225250581
but so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe				6144.099860771319
wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting up				827.9258263962854
he turned towards noirtier the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance momentarily increased				9147.909572680486
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive				18320.411557508163
ten kicks on his back said d artagnan be off you little villain and forget not that i have your address friquet who did not expect to be let off so cheaply bounded off like a gazelle up the quai a la rue dauphine and disappeared				688.4947903440984
i could make of that subject two volumes the size of this continued the jesuit and in his enthusiasm he struck a st chrysostom in folio which made the table bend beneath its weight				4156.25540303774
i am nearly thirty seven mind aramis d artagnan smiled as he spoke since we are together again let us agree on one point what age shall we be in future how formerly i was your junior by two or three years and if i am not mistaken i am turned forty years old indeed				729.7415773472632
what do you want asked blaisois				12011.851918827851
beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative				4125.00071527171
what do you say to a thousand crowns d artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner				754.2783836422432
do you wish to go to m danglars				193.82956025665527
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be it is in fact magnificent said andrea				362.43914991484155
but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait athos stopped				1332.9056266066461
unfortunately i had not above 1 500				136354.09824728098
two aces the englishman looked and was seized with astonishment				897.151170350694
i did not know but i had better remain where i was seated				10579.829175787941
i hope you will not complain now said the jeweller				4016.209377227516

ah traitor muttered d artagnan leaning toward aramis and whispering in his ear you have made us swear on the crucifix of a frondeuse chapter xxix				32698.777281146035
the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied thank you monsieur le curé i accept sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep to night madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction				5585.337411730564
i also was married at the death bed of my mother and certainly i have not been less happy on that account still that idea of death madame said villefort				85.06954067075964
the time had at length arrived two feet of earth removed and dantès fate would be decided				5557.352590008494
rochefort all is not lost and perhaps perhaps everything is for the best the fact is that i do not doubt your eminence s genius will repair the blunders of his agent is that it that is exactly what i was going to say if your eminence had let me finish my sentence meanwhile do you know where the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham are now concealed no monseigneur my people could tell me nothing on that head but i know you monseigneur yes or at least i guess				8328.146505737397

he acquiesced therefore and chose the hundred pistoles which the englishman paid down on the spot				3608.679733068487
barrois who wished to go to bed himself observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of rest				2079.615613659284
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons				9731.613927056897
the two lower rooms consisted of a dining room with a table chairs and side board of walnut and a wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or timepiece				19731.822081363956
he answered therefore i think monsieur le comte that you had something to communicate to me at your chateau of bragelonne and that gentleman he pointed to aramis had also something to tell me when i was in his convent				1451.7849079303094
a rapid change took place in the young man s feelings				4421.109517262897
and you porthos i agree to it too said porthos if d artagnan approves of it				64.88688796415093

oh i am guilty then you will not pardon me the monk recovered his usual expression				1561.6808828662918
the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe				16585.05214258827
the queen had confidence in the courage of d artagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced				4342.9636202509055

grimaud said athos put yourself at the head of the troop and beware of the monk grimaud shuddered and nodding awaited the departure regarding the butt of his musket with silent eloquence				6818.328889458874
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine o clock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis				2568.2984540442667

how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which i had counted a little i must confess for the time i have to pass here no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued well said milady what can those who sleep wish for a happy awakening				39204.00822700589
the vessel in which you wished to fry us is still smoking and the situation in which you are is a bed of roses compared to that in which you wished to place us and in which you have placed monsieur groslow and his companions sir replied mordaunt in a tone of deep despair my penitence is sincere				34304.28625293885
i have only two adversaries i will not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even them they are time and distance				3216.2661075644687
if the serpent be dead why not its brood				24823.75724415662
he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a good augury				6158.724898764799
no no my boy i prefer remaining honorably in the capital andrea scowled				10247.0683905884
albert was silent an instant after the countess resumed you came to inquire after my health i will candidly acknowledge that i am not well				711.8351105017567
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint méran				4652.978861891965
he had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his boat being ready he hastened on board and they were soon under way				692.6098027575588
i will not answer for them				53.309637666998945
then you must have something on your mind said athos				14.056320162936682
it was six o clock in the morning the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp				3230.7516080698415
an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of the procureur				1942.0258308485325
oh i am very presuming i am aware				20130.728513880895
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights				3457.101257216332
did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to brussels for the queen ah				482.1278388959213
but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have the good fortune to be beloved by you				80.88151806883198
porthos said d artagnan if you can still speak say a word my dear porthos to this good planchet planchet my friend said porthos in a melancholy voice i am very ill should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me oh				724.5006053854522
athos divided them into three groups assumed the command of one gave the second to aramis and the third to porthos and then each group went and took their watch near an entrance				2073.6416585422858
come now i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past with all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten				1404.2661150643012
the name of father is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to obey				3472.1051659417035
what think you of it inquired athos				16.321080926211902
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although i place the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself why do you ask me that what do you wish send for him i will tell him what i have seen and we will consult together and examine the body and you will find traces of poison no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say dear villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servants if from hatred watch your enemies what do you propose to me d avrigny said villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my house impossible				1226.334521112418
but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty				2836.5832610590483
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the left				1132.804425517517
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers				1128.9569095626805
what do you want something to drink your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome then give me water cried danglars endeavoring to parry the blow				1720.6437245330915
ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the hôtel des gardes				3283.535025845113
you ll bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur groslow by this arrangement d artagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis				275.46357618665155
he had a remarkably fine garden full of vegetables flowers and fruit				3629.3948768428604
divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the rest having been broken by the waves				1423.2555013664896
at four o clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the stables				9859.72663166434
what say you morrel ma foi he has an open look about him that pleases me in spite of the singular remark he has made about me gentlemen said albert germain informs me that breakfast is ready				847.0262142295742
oh the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those days monsieur returned villefort i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation				3097.773160415904
barcelona has risen in his favor all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stock jobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow				1742.2772872940104
you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host good night and mounted the stairs				1007.6505008974071
he saw that it was a merciless war between us a war to the death				697.9018919844789
are you ready sir he said at last				1619.1290644589649
and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert				109.4838901186867
he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner				7220.378311102786
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them				70.86945072122478
our duty is fulfilled not yet said aramis we have still a word to say to these gentlemen and turning to chatillon sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something i can not say before the queen chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor				1273.9620975717517
there he found everything arranged in due order the accusation examination morrel s petition m de villefort s marginal notes				3472.8237831790716
well that is all that i wanted and i will be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his hand to monte cristo				7.8806429596076155
the next day the prisoner s room was full of pictures and mottoes				16229.49914444683
there is one comfort we are all in cash said d artagnan				1.4627390126804074
the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged				5914.575114809205
no it does not concern me				35.08665283231354
what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another				847.9686179135367
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos said she simpering				42837.72781343219
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water it was the general s body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead				962.17965358563
whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winter s athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to raoul s account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle				1006.5315920644166
ah perbacco indispensable were they certainly they were supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child true said the major there might be doubts raised in that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated it would be fatal to his interests it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance o peccato you must know that in france they are very particular on these points it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the priest and say we love each other and want you to marry us marriage is a civil affair in france and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers which undeniably establish your identity that is the misfortune				2111.9901290486714
the boat moved off toward the left hand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the right hand bank where they fell on their knees				801.4234397352614
then offer him double that sum a banker never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital is your excellency really in earnest inquired the steward				4378.850436645466
sir said beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from paris at this moment and can not justify himself i accuse no one sir said danglars i relate and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you does the count know what answer you received yes i showed it to him did he know my father s christian name was fernand and his family name mondego yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less				4745.379656096691
she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul				2527.6247938489
my god can you not remember her name yes it was pronounced in my hearing once				863.0299625005607
shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron				2598.638416426559
the host fearful of consequences with the help of his servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen where some trifling attentions were bestowed upon him				14.771521458659823
but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk				18334.569106823474
what do you wish sir asked morrel that i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil noirtier s eye remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a promise did not suffice then it passed from his face to his hands				300.6660943991595
no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity				18728.593546347092
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited				2402.4905961759805
but the third time which is the present you may succumb				19795.868452295676
he then set himself to work to count his fortune				1262.2025834206722
it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration				5907.742683218192
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag				13138.011162618219
come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general and of mercédès in particular and i am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me so much the better so much the better said caderousse				186.82817112140268
there were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless life of an only son and who lives as it were in a gilded cage				8739.29992472411
the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner				1144.6894326740216
the fresh earth excavated during their present work and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the window in either faria s or dantès cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain				3880.2753033915205
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present				2617.9135463138937
so pray keep your places like athos whose calmness is entirely laudable				50881.443615448785
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar				16655.157327380595
at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilian s taste				3708.517958763106
speak the window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than before				834.511642895371
in order to see the queen said aramis we must first see the cardinal and when we have seen the cardinal remember what i tell you athos we shall be reunited to our friends but not in the way you wish				1393.2217651231992
sir we don t keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay dealer s where is the hay dealer s at the last large door in the street are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw yes there s the landlord of the lamb and gros louis the farmer they both live in the rue des ursulines very well d artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles each				2530.812318529622
but contrary to all expectation when the 31st of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision				35455.17947180107
now guess what the young one did tell me he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body				832.7439401252569
do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control				6209.982902051248
the next moment the very planks of the scaffold creaked with the weight of an advancing procession and the eager faces of the spectators confirmed what a last hope at the bottom of his heart had prevented him till then believing				11029.54040039261
and how by the queen s almoner to whom i am very intimately allied said aramis coloring				29740.167974637698
3 1627 it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done				1636.3036773106805
he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he re opened them and stood motionless with amazement				1815.653860176088
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water				1394.142844570091
monsieur said athos i have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their custom i have no seconds on my part monsieur said d artagnan for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de tréville to whom i was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his friends athos reflected for an instant				1493.336671921144
you may well believe that we will not accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been promised to us no pardieu though i should like to have seen porthos on my yellow horse				1278.9799568384665
this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape				880.7721025462025
she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her				87.85456136157306
except your signature and your partner s m morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow				682.3200757539395
he then laid him down on the floor where d artagnan after giving him just time enough to draw his breath gagged him with his long scarf and the moment he had done so began to undress him with the promptitude and dexterity of a man who had learned his business on the field of battle				1015.4490083147734
he is very susceptible bah said debray he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort you said so yourself true				1442.5814657802343

it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury				17087.41599233323
well said porthos to aramis we must do something monsieur is full of generosity said athos				13.930755289210644

these two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed				2816.059303965105
an approaching battle was much spoken of the prince having manoeuvred until that movement only in order to await a reinforcement that had just reached him				14.508989863180835
everything was as athos had foreseen				2057.4171355649464
but monte cristo without rising and leaning forward in his chair merely stretched out his arm and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man sir said he in a solemn tone i consider your glove thrown and will return it to you wrapped around a bullet				15222.086339098953

all the way and in proportion as the corridors became more deserted d artagnan wished to stop the young woman seize her and gaze upon her were it only for a minute but quick as a bird she glided between his hands and when he wished to speak to her her finger placed upon her mouth with a little imperative gesture full of grace reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must blindly obey and which forbade him even to make the slightest complaint				15582.800215102649
irrevocably you hear sir said d artagnan turning to mordaunt				961.5036155535797
whatever command she had over herself milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him				16.030000288747395
but as there were all kinds of people about who were in a state of stupefaction at the unexpected arrival of the court he whispered in his friend s ear				1166.2794249487483
i have driven away the swiss to humiliate you but i shall lodge here no longer				3674.8045204056725
my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety				1503.0853765939542
the girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply				834.608742527058
no no answered dantès don t imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner				812.9916078512443
albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances				8979.044343130661
why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a table covered with flowers and gently glided into death amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses morrel smiled				1341.7548009449608
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort				84.18981883577386
then the idea struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a corner				1761.1570249572471
everything had gone on as usual at the palais royal				3272.1376838222986
your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom i had the honor to speak to you planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses				4746.533810837092
read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow				24541.94658560859
i descended rapidly although i had not seen villefort s face i recognized him by the beating of my heart				358.2179724090891
near the camp you might be recognized and your presence you must be aware would compromise the cardinal then i must wait here or in the neighborhood only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the cardinal let me know always where to find you observe it is probable that i may not be able to remain here why you forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute that s true but is this little woman then to escape his eminence bah said milady with a smile that belonged only to herself you forget that i am her best friend ah that s true				1021.0862042429692
do you know what you look like all together as you are armed and guarded by your lackeys said the cardinal				305.6987020979339
richelieu as everyone knows had loved the queen				335.58172441616955
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort if i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i can not break				15749.398561767583
you see we were quite right to pacify that country yes but don carlos well don carlos will drink bordeaux and in ten years we will marry his son to the little queen you will then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry i think albert you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this morning well you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach but i hear beauchamp in the next room you can dispute together and that will pass away the time about what about the papers my dear friend said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt do i ever read the papers then you will dispute the more m				859.0662328064896
why for him and not for me				37.21642664628523
now let me tell you some news eugénie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival				3417.3592496418396
both raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed				1265.6233968632664
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better friend than you and as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house				598.3988742975157
yours affectionate de tréville well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me athos to the waters of forges there or elsewhere in the king s service either the king s or the queen s				923.6968400076978
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him				20.18634835131166
our host has a well furnished cellar the key of which never leaves him only this cellar has a ventilating hole				2184.7010014936636
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered				749.5031458746256
i have never seen her from that day				565.1334409985042
and so the good la ramee made a festivity of the little supper with his prisoner				1154.9123666063333
planchet said d artagnan cocking his pistols i will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one below				5180.091361287122
milady was handsome enough not to find much resistance on the part of the flesh and she was sufficiently skillful to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind				872.4198190817383
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars				114.6469640374135
i have an idea which i will explain by and by of making an exception to the usual form of accusation				5066.7874921391585
as i came into the public room i saw one of our englishman bargaining with a dealer for a horse his own having died yesterday from bleeding				87624.79814218446
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir				6420.945326320061
the two friends turned down the first street they came to				2854.4039009264825
and king charles x had preserved a great number of friends and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave villefort a claim on formed a considerable body				1187.5895215635671
this idea imparted new energy and in three days he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the stone work				2055.457925228763
oh yes certainly said the count uniform cross knee breeches and how shall i be dressed demanded andrea				469.94718476611837
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night there now				1347.5112252547708
through this the king was to escape the next night and hidden by the black covering of the scaffold was to change his dress for that of a workman slip out with his deliverers pass the sentinels who would suspect nothing and so reach the skiff that was waiting for him at greenwich				3422.812724219298
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word				1196.9438532671668
hush he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee the sergeant began to laugh				1099.7730459115564
he used to weep he now laughs he grew thin he now grows fat				3079.7251484221806
then in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with he directed his steps for the last time toward the residences of his three friends				592.327062241719
their connection could not last long without ruining both				5765.092144532749
at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the ice cold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves				1444.076995974558
in fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind				2086.1428807386774
you will ruin both yourself and me by your folly how so said andrea				357.06208004285656
what the devil did you come to such a country for athos				59.3308216590061
she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her face dropped off and madame danglars was recognized				2107.5797221037087
whilst d artagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris				369.52524035696786
her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother				9400.154168412555
have you been or are you his mistress oh no cried milady with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth				1728.9644419003318
d artagnan therefore returned to the rue férou				9097.388592008745
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said sharp true my lord exclaimed la ramee				596.8270134605287
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness				1880.1778037367035
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room				355.878013240941
there s the article of remunerations and indemnifications to be discussed and set to rights chancellor said the queen turning to seguier our old acquaintance you will open the conferences				32209.548803150945
come then and take a turn with me and i will explain the hostess who knew d artagnan s skill with the sword began to weep and tear her hair				2970.402689749677
whatever evils may befall you they will not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly promise you la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words then let her head again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the conversation but remaining so as to be able to hear every word they uttered				5552.3940928634665
he had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion				41604.572134529044
now at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused				2671.1121653473965
ah you are his son he said that is a different thing sir i surrender said louvieres presenting his unloaded musket to the officer				1857.0798839209847
i am haydée the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his beloved wife 40202m the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly				3339.234207182341
it had been said that evening a hundred times and scarron was at his hundredth bon mot on the subject he was very nearly at the end of his humoristic tether but one despairing effort saved him				20.152134303490566
have you anything particular against him possibly did you ever meet him previously to coming hither i have and where will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to tell you i promise upon your honor upon my honor then listen to me franz then related to his friend the history of his excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two corsican bandits with them				287.3792698791218
let us drink my dear d artagnan morbleu let us drink while the wine is fresh				42766.70212053733
in fact the rochellais had made a sortie during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before				856.355459930843
you incline me to think so said the king				442.79218330113144
you say you have nothing to do with my cash box				1314.4045025986234
he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish				28163.843707853754
dost know where porthos is no not at all and aramis not in the least the devil				1421.524611580637
which means that i have just been duped sixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour d artagnan and athos laughed aloud				8201.235874060589
the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite				125971.09976286154
he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty				2203.4616955334086
adieu monsieur de rochefort he said				493.5463443897211
other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers				1173.8449174664538
however there are plenty in the world but you don t look in the right direction for them my lord indeed				690.2547536297922
i am not a banker like m danglars but i am quite as incredulous as he is i am going to give you a proof replied the count and he rang the bell				3201.8730364879366
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold				1685.0703095714334
she is all powerful yonder she will help me				31.035376620461747
the cardinal was lavish to his underlings yes yes guitant said mazarin richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect				32411.84126454789
i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron s banking establishment i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it and further that he stated to m danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions				1977.3424206348996
advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down				853.4521800758921
she has taken care for herself at least i hope so for her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me				106.15302723826255
yes undoubtedly the abbé busoni himself replied monte cristo				6.171773428024158
if on the contrary he refuses to do so it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into your secret they will not be strangers they will be friends ah but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow beauchamp for instance so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to beauchamp i do and i will tell you why				40543.40480178917
which was the real delinquent both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post and where was this letter written at la réserve the day before the betrothal feast twas so then twas so then murmured the abbé				479.50727012278145
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him				31.563957265883822
yes my lord my mother replied the young man advancing into the room until he was face to face with lord de winter and crossing his arms				659.0418443778127
d artagnan was acquainted with villars cotterets having gone thither with the court on several occasions for at that time villars cotterets was a royal residence				3898.4688680866384
aramis was the next to come in and to discover athos almost insensible				3089.4415355549722
the siege of la rochelle the siege of la rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of louis xiii and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal				628.0003008944446
besides they felt that the dénouement of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make				4545.435468609819
thus for instance the excellent abbé adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments really yes i will mention one to you				175.7966159968053
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with letters of diamonds				3237.9817490777723
already rich he held a high official situation though only twenty seven				3313.3175958589445
the review over the guards set forward alone on their march the musketeers waiting for the king which allowed porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the rue aux ours				2130.3184130229433
speak i am ready to obey no monsieur no i am not called louis the just without reason				2361.3724864088194
ah it is certainly you he cried				1703.2789700705198
having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say				662.7886401612416
edward said villefort fixing an imperious glance on the child go and play in the drawing room my dear i wish to speak to your mamma madame de villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance that resolute tone and the awfully strange preliminaries				43819.56531695457
while working night and day i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same sort of happiness i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering but sir he has fled let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence i tell you it is too late early this morning the telegraph was employed and at this very minute sir said the valet de chambre entering the room a dragoon has brought this despatch from the minister of the interior villefort seized the letter and hastily broke the seal				4403.184521411182
besides you are right in another respect which is in thinking that if we were to meddle in politics there could not be a better time than the present how can you know that				345.89363855104534
bonacieux somebody is coming immediately the door opened and the superior entered				822.2760674358296
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands				291.91680555266356
i am not one of those tyrants who detain women by force				2424.4610344665357
arrived at ryston d artagnan assembled his friends				435.0864879227478
with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years i only await one thing before following your advice that is a minister who will hold office for six months				2183.6022352102636
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends				605.8650181507755
the count soon mastered the mechanism the gate opened and he then found himself in a little garden about twenty feet long by twelve wide bounded on one side by part of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate and on the other by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with wall flowers				2633.4109221761214
do these belong to the cardinal				385.59008782863316
have you monsieur le gascon asked mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands				336.68846858373655
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him				59.55082437772541
faria who for so long a time had kept silence as to the treasure now perpetually talked of it				79.3636618073416
as for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of god by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know him				32.860354258265424
the very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house now become the property of dantès were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited				4201.235494588833
franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host				727.7379501277273
they passed into the eating room a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen				2976.806036820063
as for villefort instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised dantès in the hopes of an event that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration				97481.15536975705
what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die oh i entreat you exclaimed morrel in a low voice do not speak another word count do not prolong my punishment the count fancied that he was yielding and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the château d if				15006.025850814354
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips				879.041786827304
we chased him for six hours and when he was near being taken when st simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the halali crack all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a two year older				44286.52720087042
your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable				2959.124130084472
is that all you want yes valentine rang the bell and ordered the servant to tell monsieur or madame de villefort that they were requested to come to m noirtier s room				222.65679325267482
you were saying this were you not well i own it i will answer you villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars then resting both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual there are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discovered villefort here extended his hand toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die				822.4411546465257
i will not sleep where i must scorn				9072.37558577713
upon my honor this man fancies the world belongs to him				14.58233003234552
dear maximilian interrupted the count listen how adorably duprez is singing that line o mathilde				103882.314550772
the thin spare man yes the executioner in short asked aramis				22.396620652914635
already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht				4376.049238886879
branded in the eyes of the world you invoke try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor mad then addressing the man who accompanied him executioner said he do your duty oh his name his name cried felton				281.45610459140346
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson french				1443.4649695766302
they traced her to châlons and there they lost her they lost her yes forever madame danglars had listened to this recital with a sigh a tear or a shriek for every detail				10584.209016850717
i was at the end of my journey and of my credit				2904.764916645859
he only felt one uneasiness and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends				412.9611730929477
five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs				8865.257353841314
and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably not toward london where d artagnan and porthos believed they were going but to durham whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the tyne near newcastle				25725.47944576185
everyone knows that drunkards and lovers have a protecting deity				80211.89206611215
i went too but as i was older than fernand and had just married my poor wife i was only sent to the coast				8847.140841123422
if he should have known me again how				2165.0477936011453
tis a long time since i saw thee come come d artagnan said athos do not affect to be strong minded there are tears in your eyes				654.9819621365325
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safe conduct which he had given me tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be feared d artagnan and athos tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreuse he may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle i thought so too but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away the devil				1467.0459326560988
oh is it you dear friends				309.0288620177584
dantès spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice he had tried to speak when alone but the sound of his voice terrified him				11.226807479738124
oblige me by taking a seat said d artagnan pushing a chair toward mordaunt who sat down pale but calm				2473.4265547833074
as soon as there was room for rowing his companion rejoined him and the boat began to move more rapidly				4743.92265378128
silence and fatigue together overcame d artagnan and sleep overtook him also				1550.0901697649997
it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place				442.1697588657744

others besides you have undergone such monsieur athos and have replied thereto thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us and we are ready to reply what was that letter you were about to read monsieur aramis and which you so promptly concealed a woman s letter monseigneur ah yes i see said the cardinal we must be discreet with this sort of letters but nevertheless we may show them to a confessor and you know i have taken orders monseigneur said athos with a calmness the more terrible because he risked his head in making this reply the letter is a woman s letter but it is neither signed marion de lorme nor madame d aiguillon the cardinal became as pale as death lightning darted from his eyes				649.5028709304567

the two friends were in the via dei pontefici				22672.97026409034
as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign				1922.5213066835136
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future				1739.2359576039196

have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime villefort tried to smile				394.87754590936254
i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero				6863.239118133235
he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood				10858.543225993732
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brother that is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it				44.56468624654605

he will be furious but i don t care				2639.693177520378
monsieur morrel said valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather m noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you				49.30977368746134
the last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived gondy				1549.3223928974344
i will not die alone i will not and he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands				307.8334668502105
tréville added the king in a low voice as the others were retiring as you have no room in the musketeers and as we have besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that corps place this young man in the company of the guards of monsieur dessessart your brother in law				1000.7776427016042
the evening was no longer joy but delirium				2761.6049548267188
the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is you frighten me not executioner s axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and i strike you now waiting patiently and christianly for you to return the blow and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on				610.2745625454115
d artagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side				1056.279599632155
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together				1345.1474560292431

do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness				174711.343728998
milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward				6690.545563179344
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell oh				857.4435656551523

bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already full				7013.089425553498
one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened to you lord de winter had said to felton				440.25167578231276
since the death of little edward a great change had taken place in monte cristo				16.770071070003645
i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you				24.44199820991147
indeed every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should take place and every day the cardinal under some pretext deferred fixing it				157.96020284549138
i have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention i believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince yes i understand it well				661.5244142350713
she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance				28587.77786540197
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal				5093.754275036376
voices unheard except on days of revolution were distinguished faces were seen that only appeared on days of bloodshed				34026.03379072921

d artagnan saw that the moment was come				1857.4660128246471
go on with your recital sirs said the queen turning to the duc de chatillon				2537.8141006590185
de chevreuse had been in paris but still further that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a cabal when he affirmed that he the cardinal was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about her the queen s emissary to the exiled duchess a musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king louis xiii				2157.6222928890975
he gallantly offered the right hand seat to beppo and sat by him				27.79267114160145
beppo got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice				11685.044150180647
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened				4708.967234742996
endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers he remained an honest man				209.02781057078286
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan				2281.7119019772745
a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlord s hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m franz d épinay				6537.273485540067
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort i promise on my honor then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into execution and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work at least a year and shall we begin at once at once we have lost a year to no purpose cried dantès				160.55080270248143
i thought we agreed for the price i asked that is replied the jeweller i offered 40 000 francs forty thousand cried la carconte we will not part with it for that sum				4655.153708959187
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend				26637.769963504394
faria as we have said without having recovered the use of his hand and foot had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner who learns to make something from nothing				467.75155885751474
he said as to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace good very good said porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron at this moment nine o clock struck				1056.8791410182587
it was that of la carconte				1547.4344976975929
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me edmond replied who knows				5470.265145680465
oh aramis continued athos shaking his head mournfully upon my soul you make me the most miserable of men you disenchant a heart not wholly dead to friendship				7936.745132748283
i am all attention said the abbé				444.1972203869087
they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood				1548.684961678984
i ask you what year is it the year 1829 returned jacopo				5928.6933843588995
don t make a bad use of it i entreat you				24.52778827734206
meantime you see that the lackeys saddle the horses i have no horse said d artagnan but that is of no consequence i can take one of monsieur de tréville s that is not worth while said aramis you can have one of mine one of yours				1403.6134006977325
in the first place he himself furbished a sword which he drew from its perfumed leather sheath he examined it to see if its hilt was well guarded and if the blade was firmly attached to the hilt				32077.36725817179
apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that i should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether i am as he says too old for action and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make d artagnan shudder but d artagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said go demon do what thou wilt				57004.08114624614
while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate				1763.7681710689299
yes monsieur a most excellent sister married nearly nine years happy asked the count again				232.25289957603204
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared and then i knew you were seeking me from whom from master bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers oh monsieur said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly				60229.9023561517
is it really for us that you mean your attack here he is				1169.4982632808665
buckingham saw this apparition in the glass he uttered a cry				1847.6650224926416
the bills were renewed the old ones destroyed and the poor ship owner found himself with three months before him to collect his resources				5821.201323356107
besides he wore the uniform of the guards which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies				3288.4613145987228
ho exclaimed d artagnan picking up a louis and displaying it here s a louis that smells confoundedly of straw mousqueton blushed so confusedly that the gascon began to laugh at him and said porthos would be angry my dear monsieur mousqueton but i pardon you only let us remember that this gold must serve us as a joke so be gay come along mousqueton instantly assumed a jovial countenance saddled the horses quickly and mounted his own without making faces over it				114.09679823536551
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior				3923.56311525379
and you are happy he said to his friend				590.613982102429
come fanny we will put her to bed m d avrigny who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with noirtier expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered				26816.319015126926
that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the honor of knowing her personally but i know a great number of her most intimate friends				536.6678690587538
thus from fondi to perusia everyone trembles at the name of cucumetto				4804.161024208951
how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands how i have called him in my long sleepless nights how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them				229.94441382859463
40188m florentin here cried he starting up is my mother ill and he hastened to the door				172.15209721428593
villefort fully understood his father s meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders				829.7185128089236
alas it is not the death of the body i regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspires is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon				3499.120311170069
i am all that is left to her belonging to my poor renée whom you have so soon forgotten sir ah madame said villefort you forget that i was obliged to give a mother to my child a stepmother is never a mother sir				424.55785185451293
he has faith in himself he has faith in his friends he wishes also to have faith in his queen				321.7694136015456
a propos monseigneur continued tréville addressing the cardinal monsieur de cahusac is quite recovered is he not thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger				2973.5856246246976
grimaud himself understand and with the ten parts of grimaud which are not worth a ducatoon i regained the diamond				1498.4624442574782
he was embarrassed whilst speaking to me and yet quite firm in his determination to refuse				75907.17874466817
madame de lannoy whom according to your majesty s command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day that s it cried the king to him no doubt				1653.598962756504
d artagnan i have always loved you as my son porthos we slept six years side by side aramis is your brother as well as mine and aramis has once loved you as i love you now and as i have ever loved you				28.672293753339652
no but perhaps you will permit me to call to mind stay the count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts				873.3001075233551
a handsome young fellow like you does not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress and we were impatiently waited for at paris were we not my faith said the young man laughing i confess it and so much more the readily my dear bonacieux as i see there is no concealing anything from you				56.08900864082593
he sends me for that purpose and here i am the poor woman s head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees				759.0474883988331
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms				7740.707946404301
my father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk				8195.254755488711
the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man				416.17704703240923
is it possible that rochefort has become a better man than i am he said to himself				164.03776940774716
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep				1765.1808261959595
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications				36317.54608830335
in that case his last hope would have been destroyed				3028.0138644594904
but he is mistaken i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point anne blushed and buried her face in her hands				367.30910693809113
ah this time cried d artagnan springing to his sword this time he will not escape me drawing his sword from its scabbard he rushed out of the apartment				743.4846738425985
she did not know what might take place during this night which approached so menacingly for large masses of cloud rolled over the face of the sky and distant lightning announced a storm				3239.8566955890933
oh enough of this enough of this he cried let me save the last on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb				2998.1069476147454
yes my friend and now now what asked porthos				16.34254358991266
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt				958.4348688346014
grimaud according to custom obeyed in silence the poor lad had nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak				687.9329702673224
i was without a light in that room when the wind shook all the doors behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled				3323.9357895382927
then when they had disappeared he said with a smile tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock from which he had a full view of the sea and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a water fowl ere it takes to the wing set sail				3940.087935184523
as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them				159.65286453169014
why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of m morrel who did not know his crime as cashier into a spanish bank				2329.553266421917
m de villefort s communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between m noirtier m d épinay and himself and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off				719.1364306237252
you recollect perfectly all i have told you do you not your eminence will judge the ball of madame the constable the night at the louvre the evening at amiens the arrest of montague the letter of madame de chevreuse that s it said the cardinal that s it				61.878400969365934
you will be a brave and adventurous captain d artagnan his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy went back to athos whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp				4167.905200200593
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty air disdainful lip and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her companion who was paler and more disturbed than herself				1037.3034688207852
he raised him almost stifling him as he drew him through the aperture at the risk of flaying him in the passage				1849.509949940677
what men call the chances of fate namely ruin change circumstances i have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it will not overwhelm me				39.78713751724164
the old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright				38178.50146480221
haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear				1179.2138017594154
at his announcement d artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his bones				6854.735507174813
my turn said athos himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent my turn				1524.8885861537526
her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion				14819.861095027287
d avrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about it				32.39168315690028
for the last time will you come cried milady				121.41377614792144
we will not go till evening this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it				17.65612981108822
there was a study for emmanuel who never studied and a music room for julie who never played				1680.8371513417992
my father looked at his watch and paced up and down with a countenance expressive of the greatest anguish				2054.8689582773736
the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner				2052.1135435467977
we are going then we two with our swords you with daggers				233690.6389175745
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty				1528.0388263728216
she sighed as she looked at him				18.670108179472905
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued				3638.6620991622663
but m de tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d artagnan to render the king any signal service or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action				2477.426846255926
de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror				1007.1710907472336
de morcerf s who is deceased for what reason because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired and what are they to live upon the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army 50113m well i must confess these are scruples i registered their deed of gift yesterday and how much did they possess oh not much from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs				954.973287306638
he entered and on his way met the waiter				10592.974139230888
but what are you going to fight about athos asked aramis				18.444615969505097
parbleu that s good said albert with a gloomy tone				950.2211037781417
if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior				3093.026340134858
i acknowledge i would have given anything to find it out it would be very easy if you much wished it how so probably you have some correspondent in greece i should think so at yanina everywhere well write to your correspondent in yanina and ask him what part was played by a frenchman named fernand mondego in the catastrophe of ali tepelini you are right exclaimed danglars rising quickly i will write today do so i will 30259m and if you should hear of anything very scandalous i will communicate it to you you will oblige me danglars rushed out of the room and made but one leap into his coupé				23414.87326353504
i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse				11240.140978661755
you may join me at the hôtel des gardes				3317.355151578298
28 then cried villefort was it you who bought m de saint méran s house did it belong to m de saint méran demanded monte cristo				26.580315352994784
monte cristo took up his glass again as if nothing had happened his face was like marble and his heart was like bronze				57245.201759044176
they locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the day				798.0401799453565
you mentioned a fowl i think yes a fowl peppino turning around shouted a fowl for his excellency his voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and half naked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his hands				381.3203194027825
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard d artagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal				17324.702444445218
sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction				3982.508314402954
eh it was that that did the business after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak				18480.65996154259
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us				264.25934801054865
we have the first throw ha				28471.273901867684
then he determined to go up				581.8606375409391
dantès easily recognized them faria had so often drawn them for him				23.761904993037554
who went out this morning athos asked uneasily				11013.217121882222
he alone could have transmitted to lord de winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of fatalities				17111.811952343294
make less hubbub and think more deeply				3289.1764279521626
not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order on our account said the three musketeers				935.4763549207722
when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost				18372.884205642877
no was the old man s reply i will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him i heard all this from the window for i was anxious that mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment s repose but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abbé				480.42021052142735
alas how gladly would i exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father s love				693.5632645639838
mine you have heard and that is to pursue you on earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of god you persist then i swear it before the god who hears me				32.74222668404176
for she had a wonderful way of dressing as a man that dear marie i know only one other woman who can do it as well				716.9731793064632
but still further his education had been so little neglected even with respect to scholastic studies so rare at this time among gentlemen that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis sported and which porthos pretended to understand				1148.964699139099
a dinner in the old style				2261.726251612536
but we must be going the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris followed by mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm				13356.159873984567
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens albert approached				2445.372736846171
we have a king ten years old who doesn t yet know what he wants we have a queen blinded by a belated passion we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farm that is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from mazarin s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes				26231.643229125788
this is what had taken place we have seen that it was not of his own free will but on the contrary very reluctantly that the monk attended the wounded man who had been recommended to him in so strange a manner				848.468533098024
m de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel				332.03476504628634
monsieur is as usual led by his favorite yesterday it was choisy to day it is la riviere to morrow it will be some one else				2255.4904927509447
you can not guess said he what there is in that small vase can you no i really can not well then that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the table of jupiter but replied franz this ambrosia no doubt in passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the truth i do not feel any particular desire ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed cried sinbad we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it				31.049771811122163
it is ali cried albert in the midst of the general surprise				1234.0677173473712
the young man s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie				1726.515134682569
farewell monseigneur should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days i shall presume my letter will have miscarried				21467.933664279335
it seemed as though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible thought				1342.9158975997377
there terminates at least to the present moment the duty i had to fulfill toward you the rest concerns another person and who is that other person asked milady warmly				3726.5671721945587
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken				3588.4729366267625
dantès was beside himself with joy				522.2394811623433
take care of yourself and act so that we may from time to time hear you spoken of				2509.319538805798
what more well i i m not rich				4608.784752423836
ha cried porthos who was not completely taken in by d artagnan s gasconades				49854.16576774822
faith he said in italian as he was reascending the steps and looking at a bag of reals faith there s enough to pay five councillors of parliament and two generals in paris				561.6367954718297
59 quick quick said caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti				1456.2485578587803
one terrible idea pressed upon her mind that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again				368.00474666774653
comminges saw that he was undecided				34940.4682700565
the thieves had already approached andrea some screaming la savate la savate 26 a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an iron heeled one				793.962543261218
we have met him twice at general cromwell s				936.1144523859891
we are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires				30373.311179796605
but what is going on in this accursed paris what is going on my lord				705.0905571026179
the three listeners looked at one another in alarm				3313.1343310256557
well that was a temptation for two wretches like you				225.51032732694176
every evening either in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs he met the pretty soubrette				4063.272170137011
nothing is impossible on paper in execution				1635.6951951665365
we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere said d artagnan				1.485589387677686
the coachman stooped down for his orders				1432.7940071034723
morrel however extended his arm and commanded silence				528.0106223929519
the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water				1439.6575187625444
let us adjure him in the name of the god before whom he must perhaps appear to speak the truth				1627.4267468672015
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris				469.8239523722662
however ill our two friends were mounted they were soon far in advance of their servants and arrived at crèvecœur				45506.85998277497

it seemed as though one immense blast of the wind had extinguished everyone				3095.3575126070577
this petition to napoleon kept back by villefort had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king s attorney				3106.4175665309053
i owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me i will give them				43.256047518859845
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society				6037.600292909369

there seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king louis xviii was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphius s rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horace a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch				6551.884589707482
aramis you know continued athos is naturally cold and then he is always involved in intrigues with women i believe he is at this moment in a very complicated one said d artagnan				1.4812023904438907

besides we will have no words about it				18.572515648850015
i have known persons he continued for he thought he might avail himself of the opportunity of speaking of d artagnan who by their sagacity and address have deceived the penetration of cardinal richelieu who by their valor have got the better of his guards and spies persons without money without support without credit yet who have preserved to the crowned head its crown and made the cardinal crave pardon but those men you speak of said mazarin smiling inwardly on seeing rochefort approach the point to which he was leading him those men were not devoted to the cardinal for they contended against him no in that case they would have met with more fitting reward				2561.3224838256424
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy				37218.13388828854

the night passed in perfect silence				942.8718326175181
do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at jussac and those two equally fine thrusts at bernajoux truly without reckoning said athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of cahusac i should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your majesty why he is a very devil this béarnais				27006.133204219408

the journey had seemed very long to dantès but monte cristo found it equally short				2689.6753803911856
in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man				322.0349598048803
grimaud seemed to him an antinous				24168.810538861442

i have one thing to reproach myself with said he stopping albert on the steps				3467.3832152239734
at length an old worm eaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of d artagnan				12.662643912237447

on her side but as softly as possible kitty turned the key of the lock and then d artagnan opened the closet door				276.81942608439465
villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother				1271.3580981598277

as for d artagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him				11.136555891706532
then you know him almost screamed the countess				1995.0852847068218

bonacieux from the convent of the carmelites of béthune				2214.401253277747
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee				36989.90040212672
you have not played for a long time i said you ought then to have a good hand well what then well the englishman and his companion are still here				853.2275689804541

in short at the moment in which she has just obtained from richelieu a carte blanche by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is d artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy botany bay some infamous tyburn of the indian ocean				3297.197587562611
and did you go alone asked morrel after he had read it				23.744269859568952
only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest				60161.70262078986
i remained in my ignorance and the count of spada in his poverty				8766.704789287087

athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep				1095.2665867419637
i think these fellows will never come if you are in haste monsieur said d artagnan with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days and if it be your will to dispatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself i pray you there is another word which pleases me cried athos with a gracious nod to d artagnan				3.557587991122179
then i saw no more but i heard the noise of breaking furniture				2078.377426547975
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us asked aramis				17.175712511468785
and i really don t know what prevents me from exterminating you all alas monseigneur we were not in the plot as you will soon see				1235.347080473068
the fourth as we have said was dead				724.4943869735625

i can tell you but one thing sir for the secret you wish to know is not my own				856.5437263325363
is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden cried monte cristo				5.993779202097729
but there the confidence of d artagnan stopped				1141.3913728868592
the day passed away as rapidly as an hour				1227.9823165932714
caderousse s hands still grasped the gold and bank notes and la carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest				7401.600093578842

let us shut this one up they put the stone back in its place the abbé sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the other and then going towards his bed he removed it from the spot it stood in				495.00832715420347

some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning				1326.1639870676224

let things take their course perhaps you may not have to retract bah said albert staring				45313.021304710084
had morrel been a more quick sighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the king s procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department				5383.392280539519
monte cristo was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing room				242.50170918661394
d artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed good he said				507.59959397263344

at the expiration of ten minutes aramis arrived accompanied by grimaud and eight or ten followers				8354.548893261588
after reading the letter villefort covered his face with his hands				357.0041961762168
come along danglars and let the young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses danglars took advantage of caderousse s temper at the moment to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint victor staggering as he went				2439.1016415522945
out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained				8400.5520579587
he wore a mask but you aramis who were close to him i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask then it must be a man of a certain age oh said d artagnan that matters little				1301.943846561309
on this occasion he began his rounds at dantès cell and on leaving him he went on to faria s dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen				40730.9381076087
let us go you mean no my friend said athos you must leave us leave you cried d artagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement				12346.893158104836

30185m madame replied villefort i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my father because to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority				34412.645926610305

gentlemen i will see the king this evening but as to you i do not advise you to risk doing so this advice was too reasonable and moreover came from a man who knew the king too well to allow the four young men to dispute it				42.61601695154945
he has grown a good deal it seems to me and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place				926.4312473522294
i have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father				997.8599597328943

i will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will say m de la trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it				53.58444759541364
at that moment the door opened				1368.6322383169202
athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not d artagnan				12.781863818289953
still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days she was sure he was well ah now i think of it the count of monte cristo can not appear in the hall said beauchamp				144.87690307617396

my friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his will for he was master				1745.0867642849453

as he departed danglars approached and said well it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at porto ferrajo yes most satisfactory my dear danglars well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty dantès has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much				2031.2602372527076
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle a stab with a knife for instance and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said debray				229.5517780180376
dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade				2947.707069970345

she is what the english call a yacht where was she built i know not but my own opinion is she is a genoese and how did a leader of smugglers continued franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor				4776.462907400165
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert yes you are right watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger				2973.3360818591455
one day when he was seven years old he came to the curate of palestrina and asked to be taught to read it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a priest and which having no other name was called borgo he told luigi that he might meet him on his return and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it				56.90679407036982

friends well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be possible				1478.3152458820664
it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker				5248.240092541574
it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased they ask for broussel and are only too happy if you release him to them to live under your government mazarin who at the words it is not the queen with whom the people are displeased had pricked up his ears thinking that the coadjutor was about to speak of the cries down with mazarin and pleased with gondy s suppression of this fact he said with his sweetest voice and his most gracious expression madame credit the coadjutor who is one of the most able politicians we have the first available cardinal s hat seems to belong already to his noble brow ah				490.52186563180646
milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she would have to work upon and lord de winter would redouble his watch				3683.2040378640695
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds				2984.536454939085
when i live at auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer				1306.0314891875305
franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up albert s glass and began in his turn to survey the audience				1776.6736675529019
doctor every son of woman is born to suffer and to die i am content to suffer and to await death beware said m d avrigny it may come slowly you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son villefort suffocating pressed the doctor s arm				757.064108180139
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion				1967.883612457745
there is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going				1813.1898172252468
yes murmured flamarens lowering his eyes				526.9730709107947
m villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m de villefort				172.89577911528013
two words from the hand of your majesty and your private seal but these two words would bring about my condemnation divorce exile yes if they fell into infamous hands				386.2744835206406
you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his turn and approaching the baroness to speak to her in a lower tone we are lost				1297.6957248794693
let them take my fortune i am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they will leave me in peace and quietness				33287.180356361605
i was a very insignificant person do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place				911.608245491832
danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well				813.3355390869939
and when you are looking forward to be captain it was wrong to annoy the owner but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied dantès and i hope he fully understood it yes but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one s patrons i hope to be captain without that said dantès				156.77646710342847
ah that is really original said beauchamp				132.26797760430443
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed				2768.7197504271185
let us say no more about it say no more about it				19.007697096852777
i will leave the paternal home i will give up all				404.70043438996436
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet				37666.61890495897
balls parties and fêtes are over the italian opera is in london the french opera everywhere except in paris				569.0744714031194
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison no sir not at this moment at least sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating				55085.048484894505
he is at vincennes did i say monsieur de beaufort				3848.2323285347857
a musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again				319.2431582432262
i thought you were at smyrna i was but am now back again and where is the dear boy our little edmond why with his father no doubt replied danglars				125.91307564701351
do but make no treaty you understand me you need not fear morrel advanced towards beauchamp and château renaud who seeing his intention came to meet him				18.55971861684994
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes				2204.185741538855
have i by any means displeased you				24.43039273246786
aramis the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance and who answered to the last of these three names immediately quitted the group of which they had formed a part and advanced toward the cabinet the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered				694.4938637909659
freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant manners of an old governor of the port who kissed her hand she only remained long enough at boulogne to put into the post a letter conceived in the following terms to his eminence monseigneur the cardinal richelieu in his camp before la rochelle				4326.972754605113
but wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet				1713.1160463978872
because i bent my arm and rested my hand on my elbow so do you understand what i mean yes sir				409.34558312345916
signor pastrini had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast				4536.228881869815
what an injustice my dear invalid				5968.187795115183
monsieur continued the countess advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the life of my son and for this i bless you				26.33189758415025
it was precisely at this moment that m de tréville on leaving the residence of the lieutenant criminel and the governor of fort l evêque without being able to find athos arrived at the palace				1645.2619772831686
one of her conditions was that she should come and see me twice a week for as i had the honor to tell you my wife loves me dearly my wife then came and confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great fears truly yes				924.5874245264971
scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty mean yes indeed my dear duke				461.8642757034961
but what did m danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself half malicious half ferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame				4709.852009611808
de winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room				475.16311357616786
sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains				7914.4024693261945
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france take care athos cried d artagnan don t you see they are aiming yes yes said athos but they are only civilians very bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him				26.58250179106703
indeed i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of paris				526.7128087673863
did you fancy yourself dying no i had no such idea but knowing that all was ready for flight i thought you might have made your escape the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of dantès				969.5675314115144
you are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject				1236.633666634603
let him run on said danglars restraining the young man drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says				5812.0983871222825
to nobody in the world not even to athos or porthos i have not breathed a syllable to them good enough tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with d artagnan and both soon arrived at athos s dwelling				52297.61461874871
how are you to get away from here				492.3330068153601
it was this fear that restrained him so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it				57.61326862059296
talk only by gestures or rather always listen yes monsieur replied raoul				262.7322679103846
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone				817.921305590284
at the same instant the gun was fired and he heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head				449.11064694694625
and now now escort me where where i am going but where are you going you will see because you will leave me at the door shall i wait for you that will be useless you will return alone then perhaps yes perhaps no but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman i don t know yet but i will know it how so i will wait until you come out in that case adieu why so i do not want you but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy the word is rather hard how are they called who follow others in spite of them they are indiscreet the word is too mild well madame i perceive i must do as you wish why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once is there no merit in repentance and do you really repent i know nothing about it myself				648.6452392733273
the young man now knew her secret her terrible secret the secret she concealed even from her maid with such care the secret of which all the world was ignorant except himself				377.4259554350189
coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of cheese some preserved quinces and a cake which she had herself made of almonds and honey				18566.08903897983
one however fell at the duke s feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket				751.2714546675986
all the rest of the square was paved with heads				1756.3884742141554
she prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for hours together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere				8820.821969151728
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell				6889.115510173986
each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added albert with a laugh				1098.6723305354737
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed d artagnan aside with his hand				416.8624572173751
m de blacas wiped the moisture from his brow				655.5881427620169
it would have been easier to me merely to have thanked you for preserving my life and not to have uttered a word of all this doubtless doubtless athos				251.80501856874892
if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperor s intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched my friend said my mother when your master s orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly				97884.06052916085
indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault s stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect what a dire misfortune said emmanuel thinking of morcerf and danglars				571.9564886065227
that is good to see said aramis				17.78744854415334
he said nothing but when i went out he followed and quickly came up with me				99.96749138609324
near her was mademoiselle louise d armilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy which she intended immediately to make use of				2257.6403690545762
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle				6871.353531543911
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m				327.9185126688818
this child lives and someone knows it lives someone is in possession of our secret and since monte cristo speaks before us of a child disinterred when that child could not be found it is he who is in possession of our secret just god avenging god murmured madame danglars				301.1269477072135
madame said albert allow me to present to you m maximilian morrel captain of spahis one of our best and above all of our bravest officers i have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at auteuil at the house of the count of monte cristo replied madame de villefort turning away with marked coldness of manner				832.2386065307411
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet				45555.53596626899
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends				421.9893383457393
the police belonging to the city being formed by the city itself nothing threatening presented itself to disturb this concert of universal hatred or freeze the frequent scoffs of slanderous lips				779.8573535923322
each person s attention was occupied				4414.183353349223
at the third he fell again				199.38574308433311
her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor her beauty serves as a bait to her victims her body even pays what she promises i must do her that justice				1807.4329829313708
i wish in order to honor our worthy aldermen you should appear in ceremonial costume and above all ornamented with the diamond studs which i gave you on your birthday				26999.695207813304
the jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers				1250.231440179637
the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms crossed				4514.830780920429
of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams				3479.437398631784
planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses but the horses were all used up				935.9743013936936
the rendezvous the first words that albert uttered to his friend on the following morning contained a request that franz would accompany him on a visit to the count true the young man had warmly and energetically thanked the count on the previous evening but services such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged				20535.094589330285
