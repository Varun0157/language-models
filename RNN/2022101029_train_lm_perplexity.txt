i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added monte cristo				1.0666334660009698
on his part aramis wrote a long letter				340.5205003389779
he had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog				5965.627076288073

i ask you what year is it the year returned jacopo				263.7998163544287
that voice also was known to grimaud				193.16008230627273
i have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two days and nights				988.8810193441352
onward cried d artagnan in a loud voice				16.57690693222215
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there				217.58162803276676
a friend responded peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed				503.7832087881552
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain and the count de guiche follow urban and planchet and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest				954.4524898072553
at st omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street after they departed again				169.86306279627885
now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property all my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand francs then sell out sell out marquis or you will lose it all but how can i sell out here you have a broker have you not yes then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instant s delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price				5095.59084788124
and i renew my promise				570.1538619389438
you promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother				544.0287912583634
wait my dear father said the young man one word more say on however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing what is that the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house oh the admirable police have found that out have they				1680.461296619413
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel				2579.9800303560214
i have not time for anybody s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor pastrini cried franz				202.33854208599442
unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these				1165.3777383446459
if i remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old why not				72.65566151517142
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara				284.4327823329842
here it is said athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform				1341.398480475828
morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen the only chance for albert s safety then will arise from your emotion i suffer from emotion said monte cristo				1.0406820773834513
come to me d artagnan began to be touched				829.5017300750238
the dark space frightened her				13.600505280609472
no she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty				269.53565127508995
what convent				627.8871175288901
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion				1240.105217185625
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting				1178.1908725111084
he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion				853.957771253253
this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm				1891.3891413423996
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs				177.29761167010332
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits				1690.3979112585448
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed				2156.487786828441
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead				325.9982252246945
the cardinal s replied mme				14.085849172228865
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well				214.17973956667498
but to you at least m debray i need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known				694.8479645863247
ah i understand said the lieutenant and you seek admittance into our ranks welcome cried several bandits from ferrusino pampinara and anagni who had recognized luigi vampa				1116.7127540064907
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion				221.33349713838462
he followed him				5.9375798495902625
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady s chamber				95.6569739419501
now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it thank you my friend thank you unfortunately i have just breakfasted well said porthos arrange the table mousqueton and while we breakfast d artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us willingly said d artagnan				1.0318635713594613
that will be the signal when i call out jesus seigneur but give us your word that you will come too d artagnan said athos				3.524142405292476
do as i bid you show the chevalier out and this evening at eleven o clock you have heard what i said it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o clock thought d artagnan that s a settled custom milady held out her hand to him which he kissed tenderly				1392.9480839655787
pardon me my god receive me oh my lord caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan				365.3732513110446
why then doesn t he attend to it himself as at chantilly ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where i could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges				8748.873108087224
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him				12.399247958901872
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career				1305.1991186191626
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil				1649.1192797008475
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt				324.3258666657973
and you baron pursued the count addressing franz do you also depart tomorrow yes for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two then we shall not meet in paris i fear i shall not have that honor well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse				360.71209525909666
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d artagnan they attracted his admiration				3107.3805317169117
monsieur duke i must have those letters sire notwithstanding monsieur duke at whatever price it may be i will have them i would however beg your majesty to observe do you then also join in betraying me monsieur cardinal by thus always opposing my will				312.2499465929586
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman				240.69349582526118
albert s attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed				4741.267716703725
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on				72.70223921003765
she has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left yes the fleur de lis is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices yes but you say she is english she is called milady but she may be french				615.1355038947337
d artagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the steeds				4853.324089369952
the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease				726.7087455035252
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point				1323.441926895883
his first care was to see what course they were taking				939.3119223383763
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock				6165.735873703924
he is then the same englishman whom i met at ah yes indeed				106.1807693666055
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph e				55.08136600016618
yes yes but now what did i do with that letter d artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes				2270.8111894800804
i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall see at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port				562.735619272105
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dantès sank again into his seat				239.2059658514415
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countess s visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone you were with her then i was and what did you say to her oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead				341.0723651693424
ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images				261.1222303275994
i left it when i was but five years old replied haydée				170.28777426401425
franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up albert s glass and began in his turn to survey the audience				806.0219821871926
he took his fowling piece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids				693.2170905618947
he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age				420.11412059664457
scarcely had the door closed when m de villefort sent to tell valentine to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour as he expected the notary and m d épinay and his witnesses				5904.971374696031
the devil				18.90679370397141
and yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so on one s death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one s own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes				53.05905328138674
the same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m deschamps the family notary				4873.964638969855
ten minutes afterward she was at home				406.0907017946247
the prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert				4304.685231278509
have you a heart				120.11874061469173
you furnished a principal of francs				94.50341388602736
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named				2140.0293225069513
little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians i should not have thought this the place for such a demand still if people will shut themselves up said albert and can not be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen i am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house yesterday i was at your house sir said the young man because then i knew not who you were in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby				4165.84674977721
may i congratulate you the affair is still in projection and he who says in projection means already decided said debray				84.02594673668459
she saw a woman in a white dressing gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass				472.3188491742885
that day the minister s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill humor				182.47245598722657
speak freely				43.76855528509619
yours is a noble nature he said here is your sword raoul bent his knee to the ground				47.528682466832905
fight my dear captain fight				1680.518190336118
he fell back cursing with rage				268.02689804352553
you know the same thing was done for saint stephen of florence saint george constantinian of parma and even for the order of malta				1739.0203445636141
he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty				3026.6251805064144
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor				581.8398289550622
habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great care				2691.218715213723
it is nearly eight o clock and at nine i expect a visit				665.2006282102896
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard				356.3420943563256
then he placed a sentinel at each door with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his valet de chambre patrick				1127.3350149692594
the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head				1124.356600005993
has he not come said kitty				304.3013617140185
the horse was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace				284.1063772498378
now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression				2395.201932008904
and i say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes mr				1389.2877940300957
i must leave you said du tremblay i am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner				182.63889429341057
we at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us later				1585.2567541747144
what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god a mournful sob burst from villefort s heart he approached the doctor and seizing his arm valentine said he it is valentine s turn your daughter cried d avrigny with grief and surprise				671.9079456635327
you lie it cried				85.41837691794791
why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal well you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you i have my full power show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either today or tomorrow and that i am to follow the person who presents himself in your name very well don t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess to what purpose i am a victim of the cardinal				444.0195475576703
i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me that valentine loves me and will have no other i will fight with him give him every advantage and i shall kill him or he will kill me if i am victorious he will not marry valentine and if i die i am very sure valentine will not marry him noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing				1426.1468158968923
what do you decide on sir asked the notary of villefort				103.4539698103325
i remember now milady looked around her as if in search of something				722.7984105150972
but suggested d artagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so well at chantilly porthos yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably here				164.52815378426192
i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses				496.9078224637843
the two friends turned down the first street they came to				139.10264798643317
i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me				47.38157555867202
and the next day bernajoux				252.62330147790684

that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers very well monsieur i will obey you at all points athos made two visits in paris at seven o clock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen				981.7498945015592
help no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue				382.192087239941

in italy asked the king eagerly				54.38373606512246
thanks father thanks and feeling in his pocket he took thence a small pocket book which contained ten bank notes each of francs				234.44824489768237
he left there three men				527.631333633893
it is enough				57.897203827089655
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done				795.1283223073176
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne				434.53435817678997
i have but one word to add and that is to propose an example to you not mine for i myself have never appeared at court and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer i speak of monsieur de tréville who was formerly my neighbor and who had the honor to be as a child the play fellow of our king louis xiii whom god preserve				706.8983364661273
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far				615.2754331927675
well then with well acted good humor i allow grimaud but no one else you must manage it all				86.0833956789917
anne then motioned to d artagnan to approach and he obeyed				350.40791862099053
oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon				3878.1148020523424
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace				4737.588541991019
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars the other seats were filled by debray who was placed between the two cavalcanti and by château renaud seated between madame de villefort and morrel				376.0843243032274
him i can place at your disposal it is count de rochefort i know him also but unfortunately he is not in paris my lord he has been for three days at the rue cassette and wherefore has he not been to see me he was told my lord will pardon me certainly speak that your lordship was about to treat with the court gondy bit his lips				344.21916188287344
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion i ran toward ali tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips				1190.4209278164753
enter my sister said the queen				9.805533067032691
those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave				783.9896425057876
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate				5766.675791852926
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said				49.7914771690871
from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal				1015.788491927409
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the ante chamber where d artagnan was waiting				2385.311081765899
ah said cavalcanti to himself if i only had that britzka those two good post horses and above all the passport that carries them on and he sighed deeply				1124.8472705699123
both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into milady s apartment before nine o clock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to london				207.56092272152833
dantès remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire				12710.708178834033
said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order				885.291776918064
could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida and the chinese eat swallows nests				18131.30219038977
poor assunta had guessed all				35.07686678468567
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities				4863.605584893622
you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow creature or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked				1614.7720211980477
i adopt all customs speak all languages				2094.0741435086015
well then asked athos in a low tone				86.67974128549862
woe is me cried the lieutenant there s only one man in the world who could stay my hand by a fatality that very man bars my way				323.20812664140004
then she cried ahem under cover of the mea culpa striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward her				13.039244271228654
but he had gone farther than athos for at the village of festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further				714.2975076377545
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated				10584.542120406144
he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself				168.29407095514466
of course you sent for a doctor immediately but as i have told you it was too late yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke and what did you do then m				94.01171114084786
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch				1532.5366820008492
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform no one could have said what caused the count s voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased				968.2978920573494
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand				81.73465989288802
much obliged to you monsieur dulaurier				1425.3887730590845
the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said but where is madame de longueville ah yes where is my sister asked the prince				167.2565348257407
farewell till we meet again said aramis as they took leave of planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it sir said planchet i am in all things at your service that fellow is no fool said aramis as he got on his horse				151.6395479407776
i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale				108.07346855240267
ho there boy				608.4837524159126
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed d artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her				31.088438705203814
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself				545.5523788184046
have you something to tell me asked he				10.075471374408018
he knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment				1361.765091657569
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion				273.98133881622635
i think a little exertion would do me good the two friends walked out on the fortress				7132.101304956004
louis xiv				47.73622147273789
you have credit with your landlord then asked porthos				11.847989533751074
monte cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed a grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean an atom in the infinite precisely cried albert				50.233541382074755
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith				302.17610581219924
la jeune amélie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica				3072.5348339618326
the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands				69.0982841870098
you will not				21.587068189284444
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy				2175.4044973805435
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber				84.70528445399701
the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided forward				685.7164282474241
fine sport are you still bent on departure athos asked d artagnan				1.02976489033111
paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries well well				364.7935472818563
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence				786.7297734805355
then you shall not leave this place said he				11.450900691190844
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key i open the abyss				1235.5992236211282
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading haydée aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing room				26.635747886307076
literally the basket because wedding gifts were originally brought in such a receptacle				4124.237607862174
one can say anything to me				9.119538301862955
they both stood in amazement at the door				11.209165977069016
science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies				1143.098897106067
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of it				9.25340470467782
what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table				88.38968317368185
is it you indeed				120.19219227827521
had we not better lower our heads in truth murmured d artagnan to whom m de tréville s recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me afraid and he put his horse into a trot				14942.976225024628
hold out your hand and swear cried athos and aramis at once				84.23061586868155
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her				10.54294408509719
the king s				96.44855726655689
against whom do they cry out				30.562632683155304
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions				9555.946401410489
a peer of france ah said andrea who knows major cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished no politics caderousse				399.84193913968636
oh father father murmured she courage the pharaon has gone down then said morrel in a hoarse voice				25.384584112038144
they may hear us i don t understand it at all as you execute you will understand and yet i should have preferred you will have the pleasure of the surprise ah that is true hush porthos remained silent and motionless				1099.3210950937669
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense				1619.4363738577545
at nine o clock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken				142.84566939543132
the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old man s limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open				874.8760190796536
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment				236.8258854452603
at length an old worm eaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of d artagnan				1.0510479197350602
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude				7278.674205740469
oh oh said m de tréville				16.603499165693506
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man and not more than justice either you ass				2640.570639870948
from every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh				376.41515605800333
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness				2897.7979222614463
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo				1.053799269906612
taste this cutlet my dear d artagnan tis off one of my sheep you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of it said d artagnan				1.032527565331239
you are somewhat blasé i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others				1488.1631475634342
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back				134.32937155955804
but continued aramis bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired				257.71679447097057
planchet met them hard by the shed				757.5472753426552
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker				2110.6139056011143
saved repeated morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness by whom by my grandfather				823.175233067448
i am lost said he				8.267197925290295
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual				4653.622333214567
my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and i am sure he ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires				12422.032882871552
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric in ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous				5983.552381834029
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone				1703.3699374104044
while singing milady listened				734.60980828519
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbé you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer tis true man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions				3729.8666803673264
when you return i will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you can not be recognized by them never fear there s ten o clock striking at greenwich groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached greenwich				874.2750787012898
then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyone s mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness				16771.73605269207
my intention was to inform monsieur laporte through my husband in order that monsieur laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself there but i said d artagnan can go and inform monsieur laporte no doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre and would be allowed to pass whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against you ah bah said d artagnan you have at some wicket of the louvre a concierge who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would mme				26.116375029159233
bonacieux in her power				368.2097624521113
fortunately lord de winter is rich lord de winter is ruined for the moment oliver cromwell has annexed his income resources now is the time when baron porthos would be useful now it is that i regret d artagnan let us entice them away this secret aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our confidence				1613.9006352998356
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself				116.24833498074939
this is what has happened my brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me				86.84009272525454
our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant you will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate the sergeant made a sign of comprehension				1491.037006989572
noirtier s eye still retained its inanimate expression				290.27211357243897
adieu edmond adieu and thank you but the count did not answer				168.57220235415437
he fell down this morning and broke his leg				7349.899939601751
now as a quarter past one has already struck i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes mercédès will have become madame dantès fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company				1084.7235371942666
a florentine adventurer sire and that was all while the august spouse of your majesty is anne of austria queen of france that is to say one of the greatest princesses in the world she is not the less guilty monsieur duke				6041.62064808891
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d épinay villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered				2068.3268167713154
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba then said monte cristo you went to him monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out				85.51704277648385
having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say				754.8411141417827

monte cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay				1640.1822099186288
at the end of three quarters of a league within fifty paces of festubert a larger bloodstain appeared the ground was trampled by horses				474.3189645263206
the child went directly to him without kissing his mother				333.169843658569
there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency				8077.607186782167
how have you spent this francs it is no business of mine when are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience				338.3108247058994
and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it fernand became deadly pale				164.18347842724614
the first prince of the blood the king s uncle no				76.29952623058206

you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and sisteron advancing he is advancing said louis xviii				14.218061893135449
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy why cried the queen how is that because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity				2017.5422730079454
whence have you these ideas of death you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your son challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live				515.5572310284701
toward paris who stopped him two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mention the viscount de bragelonne and it was this young man who brought the monk to you				137.4884777421496
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look				156.06423672632195
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the ante chambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landing place have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt				8447.630234110327
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement				1301.0284660827178

and now farewell farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror				206.94494134562865
d artagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth				10403.762019668082

eh eh said he reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period there is one who will be equipped in good time porthos yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator s wife as a bark yields to the rudder arrived at the cloister st magloire a little frequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each end				1610.528070132328

a circle was formed around them				17.82679627463247
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it				6.319215982950345

he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain				116.33289880013072

never planchet				506.4255960643478

i learn all in the silence of my apartments for instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers and what was to take place this evening then i wrote then remarked the president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings he is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done				80.7330161387051
bonacieux hesitated to continue				237.68240379874496

afraid of making any inquiries at this house d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras				3161.7284353226896
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose				735.1774961100874
i can not be mistaken there are your horses				446.3403814928644
i did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the count de guiche acted as his secretary there has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to raoul to rise				626.7456463084421

bonacieux moved by a double sentiment love and curiosity				922.5765670746041
she is very amiable then is she not said albert				35.030850444950545

at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared				127.88975867973907
the baroness then thought of m de villefort				5.200403602701793
carlini flew joyfully to rita telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her father to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres				2716.3320412641688
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set				4228.020569464543
my dear friend cried aramis				20.828854958810275
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire				5370.234534873946
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us				278.05344383735843
oh no				8.547337827264068
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m de tréville the counsels being thrown into the bargain				2956.851849192591
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta				2713.116549796831
your note of this morning has completely bewildered me				10.338332441066417
all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter				1476.102763136041
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both				4213.967723552859
he had learned that dantès had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done				94.5944844725065
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand				19.001453318528498
we don t know the locality and shall never find the wall				118.26543835637152
you have sent for me sir said athos to m de tréville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders				1109.1362114035812
i had no doubt he would return the following night				101.59531571295389
bring hither that horse friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road				1814.03731958306
d artagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will execute well said d artagnan i decide that we should adopt athos s plan and that we set off in half an hour agreed shouted the three musketeers in chorus				399.7243195350884
speak out there s a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise				300.0721315840279
ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of				308.9884889894955
that will be sufficient you think so certainly very well then if they should hear of the separation ah yes what could i say that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari precisely				4668.170732153338
a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand				31.314337546681024
you will retract this assertion will you not beauchamp said albert with increased though stifled anger				623.1592196263555
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead				50.21567545843811
and you as for me i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home				177.48793344934165
he is cold said debray				212.276496197329
mademoiselle paulet had already gone mademoiselle de scudery was going				516.1480694275896
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him francs for a mouthful of bread				8740.075062564738
you surely will not do that my dear count certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo				1.0388280141980495
the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women				4130.551255492355
you will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity you laugh faintly				7747.916244190359
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund				908.1031513942705
when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder a murder do you call it				7.113962332164754
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer				2070.0011689900944
d artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle				281.062209437815
i know him well there				269.96951361050304
this movement revealed the spot where winter s body had fallen				475.31381012772135
the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars said château renaud				3.2579878667541986
god beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their reward				14901.94779135065
the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said d avrigny and i will maintain this assertion before god and man villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair				205.77526172324545
had you known this edmond dantès of whom they spoke no your excellency i had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the abbé busoni himself when i saw him in the prison at nîmes go on the jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it carefully				2379.873668474815
three is just my number now then who are you asked the englishman				27.57021388500757
albert de morcerf is no coward said monte cristo				1.0477735990634538
she took me away without speaking				654.131131631367
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme				47.52836517970564
and what do you know about the state you talk of said mme				16.94610596201601
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down				124.84918337184209
oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened what				154.73186062974833
besides it doesn t concern me it relates to mademoiselle marie michon ah that is true said athos				3.8078378110695508
stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out you see i have not yet received the ring true said my mother				310.2519769372501
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond				2099.6233377102008
the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina				28960.25736219721
he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation				1709.7774584253314
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects				3032.276276761666
two men to the astonishment of d artagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier				2484.8958135255084
a merry morning to you sunshine				4166.752660582949
athos and d artagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent				2425.7307350989477
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan				1717.7105969443355
is the baroness at home inquired danglars				31.944597880013976
because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back				244.1343799114738
yes replied she trying to recover her self possession				673.2844705494654
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint méran				41.530130935629
madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album				5339.909282325853
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old yes but i could give him the order i guitant and i preferred to give it to you guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier				28731.81779827299
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping				2028.6554590488163
and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with d artagnan are you thirsty as thirsty as a scotchman was grimaud s laconic reply				1328.643272549271
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time				244.4104331216514
and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything do you then really suffer asked morrel quickly				150.33182828367765
i could almost believe myself at the café de paris murmured danglars				27.157011550264976
i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance you have truly monsieur said d artagnan bowing again a courtesy for which i assure you i am very grateful you confuse me replied athos with his gentlemanly air let us talk of something else if you please				1111.4710145694648
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment				133.47831340627448
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as i am all but convinced general quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished it required all villefort s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him				11.51515866731475
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited				1196.950131503993
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation				916.2660571958552
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of d artagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost forever				804.4377492111413
he was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor				824.312757782708
and now said d artagnan to the governor s but you are wounded it seems said planchet				160.6135147931372
bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen and what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked d artagnan				1.0366989362349006
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest				427.036303704046
in the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice let the justice of god be done and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it				9.699043322554184
but what shall you do with him with whom with albert what shall i do with albert				319.3849130432128
what do you mean				19.27475604349128
repair your crimes toward her let her go free and i will exact nothing else from you you will exact said buckingham looking at felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them				59.106473784640336
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling				968.904782790943
madame morrel looked again through the keyhole morrel was writing but madame morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper				1342.132335191376
here father here he said take this take it and send for something immediately and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller coin				5031.415190319032
you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars				11.617296882997438
he never spoke of women				7486.834062159086
the young man remained immovable				307.8007352153717
sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary at this strange and unexpected demand m de villefort and his father exchanged looks				7284.1947785401135
i accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent putting the letter in her bosom she took her son s arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs				669.9065682302584
it was only a precaution				1064.3153966419272
you are irritated and vexed tell me how this fernand is related to you he is merely my father said albert m				98.77348787992115
we have said that teresa was handsome but this is not all teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies				7105.034410563124
sure of what that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself what lord ruthven do you mean why our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in paris to be sure why not and you visit him meet him at your own house and elsewhere i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m de château renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa what of that why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner oh yes and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner to be sure i remember it all now he called himself vampa				815.1747596120313
oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me courage madame				219.02855685634592
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart				30.961086803598285
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body				981.0895784176962
oh my god thou knowest whether i am guilty				895.7589233887253
don t be uneasy on that score replied villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my house				200.2232020490127
i know he is a gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me				11.34935949522081
ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed				511.9084642256673
these exploits had gained luigi considerable reputation				2855.2370070177108

perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself				255.9580151564348

as to d artagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black				4579.976203813837
beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream				308.94929978156193

edmond started				71.98153487154319
he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet				917.4272245087692

her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion				11339.323435816394
the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents				7036.04068370549
put your names into a hat and draw lots a good idea said d artagnan				1.028865813608959
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted				2358.3387673965935
anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her				13.305953097600597

and yet that villain benedetto will escape no one i tell you will escape benedetto will be punished then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priest you should have prevented benedetto from killing me i said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast				199.34885757851
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction				1270.3115685648402
ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died of what did he die why the doctors called his complaint gastro enteritis i believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but i who saw him in his dying moments i say he died of caderousse paused				582.1586981343517
in ten minutes it would strike seven				2060.1050127528447
a horse he cried i have found a horse and i likewise said athos				4.072436878350203
listen to me edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him				14.73915284572834
the joy of the king was lively				949.0578006662635
my fault said he you must be mad				60.90030285765549
he stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk				1436.9751888077678
just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn				423.0630043248736
my lord has forgotten the supper no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present go on then have it your own way come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face				108.60903845283211
at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin who was running breathlessly				7594.884861410069
aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion d artagnan to be preparing his exordium				9437.953359932155
in the whole house said friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is noon good said comminges				136.44325494138414
you ask me why i have requested this interview i will tell you in two words sir i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven				87.48534640325451
and the edicts				368.2959804081995
i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity				2531.3856064944684
reflect that i am your wife you are a poisoner in the name of heaven no in the name of the love you once bore me no no in the name of our child				842.4495843359967
what does all this mean asked aramis				18.32079418162551
on the following morning at five o clock d artagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mother s recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor d artagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow				1103.746865296024
still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish it if you demand it why then it shall be done				48.590178453575554
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued				3675.8279963773857
here s to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and farther and as d artagnan as he spoke looked at harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself				73.55796748286404
nothing is lost then and now madame till i see you again				67.66335667889517
anne frowned				107.94759417192253
the king and his escort were no longer there				153.79186855100153
good evening madame said the banker good evening m debray probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day				224.58198663286112
i only ask you a simple question answer it that is all i require i love a young girl count do you love her much more than my life another hope defeated said the count				5.387181991593168
someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains				3083.8368303265784
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering i thank you sir i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources however my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence the abbé once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m de villefort				3.3214867927537886
the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming and the two friends began to laugh				116.1438381181174
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood				49339.60158012818
from the count said bertuccio				249.1383169799663
it was a pledge a remembrance				1691.7122745773179
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian				943.2765561482483
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lost thirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london				382.8806755968786
let them come on				84.94400569346658
say no more about it				6.036262588677791
there is everything in a jesuit convent then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men undoubtedly said aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if i could have drawn without being recognized god pardon me said d artagnan to himself i believe he has become more gascon than i am then aloud well my dear aramis do you ask me why i came to seek you no i have not asked you that said aramis with his subtle manner but i have expected you to tell me well i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsieur de marsillac whenever you please prince though he is hold on				157.4513251013683
she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul				972.2916763669532
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there anne of austria started				165.1001276384227
planchet said he				13.56913033220434
bertuccio s forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachman rue de la fontaine no				33.517719259058644
then i admit my patience failed me i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body				730.4545636875898
if the poor abbé had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a churchman				7818.848141799687
see what she writes to me athos said he				7.321845176770307
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse				981.2247877041265
good heaven				151.09331195089328
d artagnan and planchet mounted and took the road to st germain				28.326821947903753
he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury				3052.6972490602443
they are quite new and have not yet been used				298.54131411773193
halloo major				259.8171224321845
they entered for the door was not locked there is much confidence among villagers				26374.09702774289
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood				2379.001157874616
good lord said d artagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything				418.2121366260247
do you talk of your honor				7373.3697925378
it was a good augury				1253.6658388337685
d artagnan held the bridle of athos s horse and porthos that of aramis				121.1092278865607
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinal s directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman				6391.7416550014905
since you have no further interrogations to make leave me i beseech you she said				8.308384822535912
who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize				20888.9923075392
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with				286.52900642189746
but what is going on in this accursed paris what is going on my lord				48.15513581642489
yes said the duke but take care my dear la ramee for i propose to beat you badly la ramee went out				30.666549689703665
a terrible fear transfixed him				11.699028409500386
gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men				481.8869675866005
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor				4273.4512716685285
let us be the avant guard said he to porthos and find good quarters at saint germain nobody will think of us and for my part i am greatly fatigued as for me replied porthos i am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting truly the parisians are idiots or rather we are very clever said d artagnan				1.0285047291600367
be brave faithful and loyal he said you are brave faithful and loyal				9119.878368715774
the boat is waiting for us come besides said aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time				65.57597664837473
monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl s arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child				1392.6651594952414
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind				179.49072908526284
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair				148.28597113444434
the four or five remaining hours before nine o clock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visits designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker s in their gayest equipages dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative				12819.186497205757
the procureur then told his wife to come up				306.53612088995334
besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather large madame coquenard i gave you the preference				8432.0798159285
a moment said d artagnan				1.0491793169569967
let him have it let him have it she said				4.691943175937464
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir				1330.66963077082
at these words madame morrel rose and threw herself into her son s arms				109.36967083428814
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux the waiter had no suspicions andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all				389.5571741078735
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him				17.557013183330167
m de tréville was not at his hôtel				314.9169160677061
pardon my frankness too my lord i am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence				17030.08587824079
is he much changed he has become an abbé that is all you alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbé and you will find him a veritable soldier could you engage to bring him to me to morrow morning at ten o clock on the pont du louvre oh oh exclaimed athos smiling you have a duel in prospect yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which i hope you will take your part where are we to go my lord to her majesty the queen of england who has desired me to present you to her this is an enigma said athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it i ask no further				521.4934430178037
well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army oh m de morcerf interrupted morrel				26.92667106399696
what demanded d artagnan				1.0612733349116588
will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count s room and in ten minutes all will be settled mazarin started				76.75636029730427
grimaud made the sign yes				846.5307817633519
you accuse him then				58.133951867391914
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering				223.94357420736137
what asked his lordship				1740.9020544329255
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen				458.08081999090865
you must dress yourself raoul said athos i am going to present you to some one to day monsieur asked the young man				1.6454096104229599
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins poison death exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death				233.59447014961322
in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it				6.762580917229089
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away				417.9948263001468
my dear cousin i think i shall make up my mind to set out for béthune where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the carmelites this poor child is quite resigned as she knows she can not live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger				279.75893864714743
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her				17.486867931347273
i uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child				1850.8783061503354
a prisoner he reiterated				505.321535704396
porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied				1546.2956391133152
you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not yes really this is too absurd said villefort				36.24797543467525
what did your father tell you m morrel said he eagerly				28.75479979668572
i have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful what a cold wind resumed athos a wintry blast				29190.374001607976
but i will tell you				6.175724841413933
danglars left last night left m				126.80801570840566
but you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with him you prefer then said the abbé that i should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship that is true enough returned caderousse				199.43328601722644
how can it be effected someone must be sent to the duke but who who				3138.04527741622
porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play				10608.118120594061
nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that i could wish				715.7441516317257
ah exclaimed rochefort				39.97239255471057
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur d arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms				56292.70094084476
is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words oh my god no said lord de winter with apparent good nature				2002.511842481441
dantès reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge				19014.94663155167
andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune				4344.086185751318
loose half drunk imposing the king s musketeers or rather m de tréville s spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged often killing others but then certain of not rotting in prison m de tréville being there to claim them				21.998564295316708
to wait replied athos				3.8919824958310154
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambition fernand and danglars how was this jealousy manifested				38879.41213788895
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor				306.5687180452749
there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles did you ever see mercédès again inquired the priest				443.9321137343403
concerning a court intrigue in the meantime the forty pistoles of king louis xiii like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed				1931.7851054260318
gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible that will give me time to pay him the officers were full of thanks and took away their prey				43787.482659217814
to hold for five minutes the gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder				3784.43992621004
i was saying it was very interesting what was all you were showing me				6.307221138614641
if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every point pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than i do myself in the first place then who examined you the king s attorney his deputy or a magistrate the deputy was he young or old about six or seven and twenty years of age i should say so answered the abbé				19.347533530377806
but what makes you doubt it i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber and that i had found my way into the apartment of some churchman				4800.314017123499
scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows				286.98023267982194
the scotchman				103.24511741585845
you must have had enough for today				6945.273340127317
you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m d artagnan a difficult commission my lord replied d artagnan resuming his serious manner				165.8967021235912
but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you can not well mistake him he will enter by this door				56.682881302120826
you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss				10433.50039058784
cries of death				183.1117891649171
each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to porthos and mousqueton turn to the left so that athos and aramis may see you clearly from the window they are coming then said porthos				14.761864305260456

this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu not such as he is now represented broken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts but such as he really was at this period that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nîmes castres and uzes to drive the english from the isle of ré and lay siege to la rochelle				112.99941705707752

baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address				687.0190246884237

i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so				37.8572294491343
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal lower				11700.577676798668

madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv				81.65203756609164
as to his going or staying i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to do a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with anxiety				1322.6016134905342

he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one				161.33773624440897
but if you think the king s life is not worth what it must cost there s an end of the matter and i send to groslow to say i am ill no you are right said athos				277.821514744696

monte cristo quickly appreciated all that albert had collected here old cabinets japanese porcelain oriental stuffs venetian glass arms from all parts of the world everything was familiar to him and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their origin				34111.353636819644
he then set himself to work to count his fortune				710.1914571733436
m coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon porthos he contented himself with saying monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign will he not madame coquenard this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach and felt it				14.638621850760602
where were you born continued the president				34.58921430797212
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look				1095.2890443158858
man s whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them				57.98688728461935
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir				3601.071713226126
our former life has it still no attractions for you				14.978815541994363
no god forbid said the cardinal only at what hour was he with you oh as to that i can speak positively your eminence for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock although i had believed it to be later at what hour did he leave your hôtel at half past ten an hour after the event well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs is one friend forbidden to visit another or a musketeer of my company to fraternize with a guard of dessessart s company yes when the house where he fraternizes is suspected that house is suspected tréville said the king perhaps you did not know it indeed sire i did not				50.81863852586229
answer continued milady				20.743970986015768
the trial				107.16071936899714
she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration				16536.313443427436
now gentlemen said d artagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire the englishmen bowed and went upstairs				2425.4415826965437
but we know very well what had become of edmond				2760.372671479488
d artagnan monsieur well then athos porthos aramis and d artagnan forward cried athos				4.450346288119957
the demands in that programme must be granted we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations you suppose then that there are some said aramis smiling				15.582460638155368
he ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boatman				6736.97806459585
presently they heard milady retire to her room				232.59003583548866
someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was here that who was here your child your son your andrea i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness				2515.5648440578393
oh sir exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time				299.4392172158147
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor general is no other than count fernand of morcerf then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to you albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hands as if to prevent the light from reaching him				32.20371761097069
you here said château renaud passing his arms through the young captain s are you a friend of villefort s				19.84519688892821
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family				676.9040181548355
we will embrace raoul and perhaps he will have news of athos stop an idea cried porthos indeed my dear d artagnan i don t know how you manage but you are always full of ideas let us go and embrace raoul woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said mousqueton to himself i wouldn t give a farthing for his life they set out				65.46319243350257
yes count said milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met				1487.6381276981967
who ever heard of such an occurrence as this a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams				25340.22068617631
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me the physician may be mistaken exclaimed dantès				78.48948212376472
when he opened his eyes dantès found himself on the deck of the tartan				22348.637699502335
when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight that grimaud kept bad watch cried porthos who had a great inclination to vent his ill humor on somebody				5065.1255343746
the gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chained up dog went up to the cabin				10689.911661811317
ah he has a niece interrupted porthos				14.188008780251389
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her chamber				174.51191615520818
caderousse s knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry the corpse was conveyed to the morgue				21221.487493366534
the commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone else				253.4960941891716
enter sir said he				7.460796301419368
what for five years he had been wanting a faithful servant a friend a helping hand seemed to have fallen from heaven just when he expected it the least				2794.766834242212
but you may use it replied lord wilmore i understand it and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation				242.11106620062674
oh it must not be called suffering i feel a general uneasiness that is all				112.73941115458778
ah he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw				1800.8372338061906
well now she said let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you speak all that could be required of me				24.664099630513853

i saw her and you know who she is i believe i can guess at least listen said aramis				18.780621469742222
he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale he felt the stiffened limbs he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beat the child was dead				69.02474905362742
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips				212.15880843634687
he was with you just now				132.95241515543674
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets				6345.322059773402
one day the old man fell ill and died				1003.723958340851
not the least in the world oh you do quite right monsieur but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard i did not lose a movement of his features and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed still more as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction it seems you are right planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us monsieur jests but monsieur will see what would you have planchet				1134.6511267709398
i want all my household at auteuil but will no one remain in the house my lord asked baptistin				1381.9999975619603
two minutes later the thunder of a horse s hoofs was heard upon the road it was grimaud on his way to paris				124.30114079232946
my officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop here that prohibition is not for me said d artagnan				1.0283368819446075
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down				185.1309872806538
i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month				2105.7996632842464
ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan				302.51014404557554
upon his return to haydée he found her still very pale				156.74836104934425
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head				32.1193629952717
four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton				186.4200662881232

as to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail				8261.476759257454
i had informed m morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last half hour to tell me that if his ship the pharaon did not come into port on the he would be wholly unable to make this payment but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment it looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed m de boville despairingly				355.8647772099693
villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dantès patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleon s return				1362.727104133125
it was then that d artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it				6.41980813814487
besides it was necessary he should stay at chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess				2295.0209643195085
etiquette had no minutiæ unknown to him				10.908242954513037
here you are home again raoul said the comte				1569.2014581315873
are they all full grimaud translated the question and groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered some full others empty d artagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captain s alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them come along he said and he went toward the door of the second compartment				7018.857027120303
after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea				149.67071287591878
a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him				4.1240833294777435
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it yes said danglars				20.78761855645961
far from here asked athos				3.982538316615791
as you say mazarin is a knave				20590.964679231456
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron s pension that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers				53151.1815830201
those must have been ten weary years dantès took some louis from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him				129.36507854585773
benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week				2859.7988928822188
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed				1136.9127767912526
but said d artagnan shall we not pursue that woman later said athos				4.190404185188861
he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure				1549.921654870676
very well take blaisois with whom i know not what to do since i already have grimaud willingly said aramis				15.99203701619967

low born fellows ejaculated porthos				12.417655153856183
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed				2610.130637928747
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world				80.35689874953694
what ails our friend said aramis he resembles one of dante s damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels				157509.5369111472
rue de la victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted louise				1370.1321155532669
a prisoner has escaped from the château d if and they are firing the alarm gun replied dantès				106.402561663743

at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open				480.42158501664113
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydée s countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request oh it is nothing said monte cristo				1.034101367631288
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pasha s misfortunes who then urged you to write				597.7187280386596

he had now leisure to look to his wound				902.0572275765104

had d artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character				615.1536899704245
a few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics				32851.15313907501
are you french sir said he to athos				47.27390546485229
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by d artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over				364.77563116863104

go the musketeers set off and d artagnan was left alone with raoul				368.7198128002385
meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet				13377.958643235897
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed				63.9539662694423
the count watched him				5.7077538819533835
i will call thee mouston and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any longer oh cried mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor i shall be grateful all my life it is too much to ask alas thought d artagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me will monsieur remain long with us asked mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance				1822.6627851678395
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him				4.714143613308114
there were but three hôtels in this part of the street and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied the other belonging to aramis himself				105.60876837427712

six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain				36.61078065862578
besides our supper can t delay you much				184.46621946197578
that was what he could not know				137.8638591372232
m de villefort pressed his hand upon his brow which at first pale had become red and burning then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his senses he wanted air				3704.8804606888452
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of to complete the precious pages				3858.3894799214168
at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters				572.4225013721309
but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter				753.0439354457121

his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole				445.4597026608571
here i am dear count welcome home again i arrived an hour since from dieppe no from tréport indeed and i have come at once to see you that is extremely kind of you said monte cristo with a tone of perfect indifference				3904.4220002234415
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door				15.172847106738763
villefort approached noirtier				65.8735809388844
it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary				58758.36319372395
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clément or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clément ever known no for perhaps they were too high placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were				338.79205910301863
if it is a snare replied d artagnan i shall scent it out be assured				5324.673825261264

i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor because i was shown up the private stairs how so i know not it must have been a mistake mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing				1871.374743109974
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth				154863.4845533195
peppino glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage widened				6085.505094967186
nevertheless one thing afforded him inward consolation it was expected by everybody that the campaign would be a severe one				860.941946701892
all the world was occupied with the ceremony so that neither the chariot nor the precautions taken by those who were within it had been observed				479.7000581912859

he led the way toward the hill of saint roche				562.3801900047699
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements				2211.45406297605
now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race				2955.557810424571
i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon				1308.9754955745693

athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded him				3.0870136885408725
franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle				5780.56230100024
i always knew you were a good son and inquired dantès with some hesitation do you know how my father is well i believe my dear edmond though i have not seen him lately yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence dantès smiled				17.42125149309952
what can you expect athos				64.4367257597823
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on				605.8476844615266
you can see it in his eye				338.6307104420779
what do you wish gentlemen who are you said the same voice in the same commanding tone				296.5177852511806
and what do you reckon your outfit will cost said d artagnan				1.0372936739426546
d artagnan is for mazarin he said to himself				77.85639404819162
from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a horse				674.7690211593041
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which d artagnan is blindly governed				125392.06053279819
now gentlemen said athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hôtel let everyone retire to his own apartment				256.83387860229766
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week and d artagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling				300.66179336694233
oh i will be a match for you murmured milady between her teeth be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monk s frock by the way resumed de winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not milady let this check take away your appetite				2546.7204739961144
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip				2180.5494238548695
we let them tell their story out replied mousqueton				108.44395768515875
the dinner chapter				1.2208988625267994
sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest how				2969.2584603018654
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that d artagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place				422.4882566971615
the marriage feast the morning s sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby tinted light				657.5702593491646
m de tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might				2691.3021292568783
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon for you see the bright side of everything what would you have said d artagnan				1.0362488015040638
and what does it concern then my captivity i heard of it the day it happened but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him				27.186280168878092
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else woman woman why do you have such ideas cried caderousse or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man what do you mean added caderousse				265.02128473542655
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table				123.17219972129982
i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your father s favor and that i might do him justice				1293.5249933440082
therefore let us separate				395.1065757233654
my faith it was time that idea came into porthos s head				35.27362034322385
your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly				91.71940568217043
the marquis of saint méran				101.5293558319057
shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès				421.9863200535803
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last those are kind and cheering words				808.7716266593081
everything was in order laces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the keys				21741.756973883734
need we think of that since we are to save the king				50.8407552335072
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold				178.4853305983575
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglars excuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery				40476.29893954504
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one s self not in paris but in venice				3252.450285215686
bonacieux had made with him for that very evening but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero that the bad opinion entertained by m de tréville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess				1683.3829927254922
come sir said comminges make haste you must obey the king sir said broussel i am in bad health and can not give myself up a prisoner in this state i must have time it is impossible said comminges the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant impossible said louvieres sir beware of driving us to despair impossible cried a shrill voice from the end of the room				172.43052010303026
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foot s pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles				1578.5622342694878
this is not the hôtel des princes come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only wish to live like a retired baker caderousse sighed				212.36184292352212

as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england she was young you say twenty five years old beautiful ravishingly blond yes abundance of hair falling over her shoulders yes eyes of an admirable expression when she chose				5268.037520180631
think of your joy mother when you see me return with an embroidered uniform				1678.5376605136385
to your eminence murmured bonacieux rolling his eyes round in astonishment				352.6794525433966
one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them				11.523312728002356
there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts				1586.719357115385
well sir said madame de saint méran after a few minutes reflection i must hasten the marriage for i have but a short time to live you madame you dear mamma exclaimed m de villefort and valentine at the same time				52.230832391267235
he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared but at two o clock she had not returned				1232.199629135049
ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the mantle piece and the shelves i have not got any candles take one of the carriage lamps bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey				428.70297481972904
well replied milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of impossibilities do not overwhelm me with happiness cried d artagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him				32.34997613251651
this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count				725.550900190874
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday				3460.234777716366
but continued d artagnan how did you escape i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window				48.22188710741988
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat				654.2384388583204
bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event he attributed it i believe to a political cause i doubted from the first and now i think entirely as he does				123.96658984794597
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long				252.95864406782044
you do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to paris without drawing a trigger grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm all lyons will hasten to welcome him				10.649199388149865

it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour s grace				7605.118932242078
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead the devil cried d artagnan				1.033733843838528
i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan				329.75182318940506
the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and re entered the hotel				1021.8645539175709
he did not wear the uniform cloak which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence but a cerulean blue doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water ripples in the sun				472.4627861565162
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman				329.222513901331
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity				24726.931423374335
oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that i have found that which i sought like a patient miner i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence				48806.37164930797
tis a comfort said the gascon since we shall not die of thirst				8403.16417737045
a handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal next moment d artagnan entered				110.36684129712175
louis xiii				5.6672690659802365
what could he say				203.1372530727757

her very self she gave it me last night				447.4002626746142
that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlini s rear when he fell				657.2956434619722
if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished				645.854585738099
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place				230.4359333778431
if m danglars will not fight with me i will kill his son in law cavalcanti will certainly fight the servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted				13174.157951945605
there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe				875.9955938710658
i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew				1354.230937541987

he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edward s room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villefort s apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor				147.83398708648105
the path was wide but dark				953.9497164295738
near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress				1134.250824974296
it was then that he encountered for the first time villefort s look that look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his own				128.4982222462547
i am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may suppose				1280.2631465632555
or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another what is that break his arm wound him but do not kill him i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i and you that will be another thing i shall be brought home no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings				2192.4413156735977
back shouted d artagnan or you are dead two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them a third pistol shot was heard aimed by d artagnan and one of his adversaries fell				809.0786642073898
yes sir and i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti count andrea cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow				1228.280396492779

planchet said d artagnan to his domestic who just then insinuated his head through the half open door in order to catch some fragments of the conversation go down to my landlord monsieur bonacieux and ask him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine i prefer that ah ah				80.43353126002083
i am going to fight because i am going to fight answered porthos reddening				1373.7904115852984
you had only read a line or two said d artagnan read the letter again from the commencement willingly said aramis				18.106573397750697
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked d artagnan				1.0346639142170164
aramis you certainly are full of wisdom the young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other sequel				14295.899724823457
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five and forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year your excellency in what month june the beginning or the end the evening of the ah said monte cristo the evening of the of june				46497.25296430533

then cried villefort was it you who bought m de saint méran s house did it belong to m de saint méran demanded monte cristo				1.0736454686765557
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his departure				749.9317801432251
you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count				7.43771489189808
at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village curé				4469.326733014324
devil of a man corsican that you are always mysteries or superstitions				14207.541666400688
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money the host became as pale as death for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master				394.4507298381109
oh mon dieu				96.11368702491947
then he said aloud you met him i dare say in the park hunting perhaps no nearer nearer still				3234.6669563961045
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it				20.240671200838662
ah monsieur said the young man i meet you then at last				152.87559134004206
you are poor are you not then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me you are not then a man of the people said mazarin astonished				45.59061618919303
he was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside				5739.385903681632
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted				677.5802423402616
come let us see what you will do for me everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply				395.1719564516195

m the epistle is laconic said d artagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter				120.11347123901295
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness				5812.879981373671
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris				111.34602220079665
come morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage				916.3551911104116
when he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head				17.474123182029047
the bolt gave way and the door opened				1402.7288714978968
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count				502.9443301722241

yes i understand said valentine it is because you love me the old man assented				39696.7099358171

my affianced husband returned				169.21874165769543
look well at me said monte cristo putting the light near his face				116.81004500495362
these two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with spain the quarrel with england or the embarrassment of the finances				9977.595993618643
don t ask me for counsel don t tell me you are perplexed what to do				143.081470556453

valentine looked at m d avrigny with astonishment kissed her grandfather on the forehead and left the room				34.92460732966478
and towards whom do you bear this personal ill feeling then said morcerf turning pale with anger				572.4508891171744
may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences valentine seized the count s hand and in her irresistible impulse of joy carried it to her lips				45.30475306083403
when the procession stopped this shadow was recognized as morrel who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his face livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his fingers leaned against a tree situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation				2170.886507755363
then m de tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except d artagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place				406.82816752176643

don t you agree with me aramis entirely my dear count				590.1871903154168
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity				8632.913478904262
in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wife s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt				225279.70392998974
he was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and i heard the phrase very often as rich as a spada but he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth his palace was my paradise				3976.2616843408887
at this instant the door opened				1184.4366651651635
a signed statement chapter				1.7686255300752873
one day when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted father said to me do not blaspheme unhappy child the crime is that of your father not yours of your father who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive after that i ceased to blaspheme but i cursed my father				34.67339179266713

monsieur le comte said the duchess giving him a letter here is what i promised you our young friend will be extremely well received madame he is very happy in owing any obligation to you you have no reason to envy him on that score for i owe to you the pleasure of knowing him replied the witty woman with a smile which recalled marie michon to aramis and to athos				93.52024781969834
who told you so				131.34834507739407

he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish				20358.507409272766
he will increase in strength and honor by struggling with adversity which he will convert into prosperity				16695.853086816074
coward he is a coward indeed grumbled the host drawing near to d artagnan and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before				473.6547079137067
a banker must you know be a slave to his promise and danglars sighed as m cavalcanti had done half an hour before				262.72149400760634

we must proceed in an orderly manner hush said grimaud he is coming out				37.460943495256
then d artagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knows d artagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant				22274.908924310024

in fact four men such as they were four men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives four men always supporting one another never yielding executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common four arms threatening the four cardinal points or turning toward a single point must inevitably either subterraneously in open day by mining in the trench by cunning or by force open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain however well it might be defended or however distant it may seem				6111.788112455972

is it not true the magistrate laid emphasis on these words as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence				80353.99440656652
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château d if that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès and all this because he had trusted to villefort s promise				2114.825941292449
and perhaps my god added he with that misanthropic tone which was peculiar to him perhaps sooner than you wish half past seven had sounded				3059.0416870813037
i bitterly reproach myself i assure you well what does it signify valentine so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five minutes of your society or two words from your lips				53.75601595451001

his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy				34799.76767327827
on the staircase he met the pretty soubrette who brushed gently against him as she passed and then blushing to the eyes asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly				1638.4320228625854
the man who abducted my wife the cardinal rang a second time				69.81498389413694

i took a wax candle in one hand and with the other groped about for a piece of paper my match box being empty with which i proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers				73186.17346691158
no for i think he never liked me since the day when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of monte cristo to settle the dispute a proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite right to refuse				26097.1256682942
but through the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count that eye which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship				1955.9931246261692

the duc de bouillon received domains of a value equal to that of his principality of sedan and the title of prince granted to him and to those belonging to his house				118.55831273330602
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be patient				5777.316189010446
he is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse the executioner muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection				8126.586981285552

the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends				125.57753948958373
d artagnan and porthos were now alone with a man who held by the bridles two horses they thought it was mousqueton and went up to him				6.571349134459417

during the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man m de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans				28148.752918751885

a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders disclosing in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rapier				14359.27256207578
he was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of police notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it might be some personal enemy whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the case he alone would gain any advantage as had done over the moor who would have killed him				3.2801118939391043
yet i let him die				238.68925223948196

d artagnan entered behind him				4.186989755965467
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain				998.5244209861972
return to camp and you shall know rochefort remained for a moment in thought then as they were only a day s journey from surgères whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of athos and go with them				28.82378884916478

behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was charles stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold				2450.643099452821

old dantès was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond				4255.577019129584
at first the captain had received dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust				30203.35108844036
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d artagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m de tréville s private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl				27035.716199118266
at ten o clock milady began to appear restless				63621.15820857865

you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variétés i purchased mine at constantinople it cost me more but i have nothing to fear but you forget replied debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free who will tell her the first person who sees her she only speaks romaic that is different but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes oh no replied monte cristo i do not carry brutalism so far				717.750008081906
at the same moment whilst d artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase				427.3722163076407
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite				140777.06024472247

the two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities				8274.218648491054
grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word pointed true said la ramee				13.459381478811547
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish				5867.338767065096
the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared				282.8421244567266
gad replied d artagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same again whilst all this was going on athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st antoine				1340.932272232688
as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte				27.751247976568283
who could know that i was here already said the young man				1.796790668222858
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge				1481.630651730464
aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon				1019.7063122049504

the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition				2802.6405319232067
now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome for my part dear mother interposed renée i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into m de villefort s hands then i shall be contented just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis				13328.03980473819
but has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel				2637.1065506635296
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning what cried all the guests you have not eaten for four and twenty hours no replied the count i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nîmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop and you ate in your carriage asked morcerf				149.82530558602832
he perceived his mistake but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness				47638.73192893677
then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads but observe cried d artagnan that there is a woman in the affair a woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her mistress beware d artagnan beware said aramis				16.97791246993557
recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us monte cristo started				384.0829684752927
the outlook was sad				191.50013901472582
when they reached the street aramis said well athos what do you think of whom pardieu				2170.703292281675

as he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this commission and then instead of putting the letter in the post which is never safe i took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to paris and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess himself				102.95044746001027
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me				38.97708388619755

oh said caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair i should say you were the englishman lord wilmore i am neither the abbé busoni nor lord wilmore said monte cristo think again do you not recollect me there was a magic effect in the count s words which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man				30.01012413088479
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop				453.895715351821
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others				1387.4433945889082
monte cristo shuddered and arose				619.9772176439416
i have seen that mother i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them				13.36209236638076

this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall				136.02814652094074
from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues before our letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will take that upon myself				438.17473084905146

instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantès carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value why everything is relative answered the abbé				20.75427553782371
arras was encumbered with fugitives				1153.4495195947256

the champs élysées				15.738721596130842
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks				72230.81759532657
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses				469.3613352974435
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme and you will probably find your theme ill chosen but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present				2024.0165797590137
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud very well let us say no more about it				5.967272350857822
then in the long days on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails edmond with a chart in his hand became the instructor of jacopo as the poor abbé faria had been his tutor				6410.812828967186
on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse				4338.7824436616
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenant s heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events				1431.4623679259373
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani s a well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation				867.8309459692542
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it				6.995278984920429
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears				988.5396867709578

mordaunt cried the three friends tis mordaunt but athos exclaimed d artagnan				1.0290093417912634
but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune				857.9412938397138
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away				69.68580372402127
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal				58739.59401755981
two hours passed thus madame de saint méran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived				197.6210294352284
now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may				18388.73069545966

no and yet they refused to buy it why said château renaud				3.8792860936081763
d artagnan went straight to the sergeant				6823.337626424632
listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which i have the key it leads into the park				1133.6409069016238
but do you happen to belong to him monsieur d artagnan replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority				7654.82458328561

cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethe s heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristo s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger				1680.7642177336159
you have not played for a long time d artagnan and i have no inclination to play swear to nothing				183.21572291117718
all at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified bound				32277.32119597283
the king signed the order for release and tréville carried it away without delay				4584.013834966901
never mind where it comes from said porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink it no said athos don t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source you are right athos said d artagnan				1.0298622838643852
and m bonacieux whom d artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him				3.8148402053012256

the marquis de saint méran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii				21.823373764836493
d artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the chateau du vallon				250.92835627231696
still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month				3860.439587729332
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression				1545.3897245198189
but d artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished				22295.120189293033
but all this will come to an end tréville will come to an end				693.2375850682258

you spent it as you pleased that was your business				710.5735522460869
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its master s favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish				3100.1433886254054

gad i should be very happy but i have my companion monsieur du vallon and the two prisoners whom i can not leave				3277.3156544092403
athos who was very expert in all bodily exercises passed with d artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them but at the first effort he made although he played with his left hand he found that his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion				1857.0187837222284
some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in hand				171.01206733614302

when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m d épinay into personal contact				59219.1542721307
the judge chapter				1.3278479656135673
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger				1162.8204595245963
besides do you see that door athos yes what then well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the air i recognize you there my brave d artagnan replied athos but you are no longer our masters				1893.1621751503524
it is true that this provincial was a gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of d artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated				24934.25122100335
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly				1007.8234904172634
yes go go said she to her brother the effects are drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them silence was re established				20269.10229408732
i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my promise if i would				2349.2049652632977
the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious				5398.0080558287555
when are you to be married i will tell you all said valentine from you i have nothing to conceal				9005.938370721995
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner				2636.109565149362
i wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so of which i stood absolutely in need on account of my accident well well she must be at her country seat for she has not answered me truly no so i yesterday addressed another epistle to her still more pressing than the first				1542.225039455947
with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while kitty pushed the bolts				32189.40447790676
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminence s commands and d artagnan unsealed the letter and read m				91.98131554101037
monsieur is as usual led by his favorite yesterday it was choisy to day it is la riviere to morrow it will be some one else				1984.5306982015077
go go i implore you and return hereafter				14558.438293093981
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and that s a comfort can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition i don t know him but as you spoke to him you must have seen him oh it s a description you want exactly so a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman that s the man cried d artagnan again he forever he				955.8589306853208
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter				411.5819242413415
ah this is not right athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room				67.49363328927518
just so why he is a second ariosto no his name is the count of monte cristo there is no count of monte cristo said debray				113.193883848732
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands				53.59809359643961
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelle en serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place				460.1812377998596
the door had been opened and shut again the mercer s pretty wife had disappeared				125.85929126769241
see said the count how very ungrateful women are				120.55552595638473
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof				23851.83772079535
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me				16.12563192958898
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m de nargonne had married m danglars				99.78251938118848
the king went straight to him				5.725049022957915
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the darkness				616.3213627993655
athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied we had a short discussion upon dress and you aramis asked athos				4.572106288205735
do you see whispered aramis to athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt				40874.91495957736
i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me athos was more delighted than can be told				7542.352488387287
but he must be disturbed cried the host here are two english gentlemen just arrived well well the english like good wine as you may know monsieur these have asked for the best				1745.5186891576038
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor				79.81048480336378
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light				909.6885110189422
luigi vampa s bill of fare chapter				91.03363360063089
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us asked aramis				19.03809341931617
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere				5405.029262585226
do you keep a journal no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself do you talk in your sleep i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember the color mounted to the baroness s face and villefort turned awfully pale				184.69039056883295
but the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow				30311.039738652205
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant				762.6940994748811
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness				8496.811469907714
it is well madame said mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer d artagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger				256.0612905334078
he is very young but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes				1065.3598468354794
send me the keeper of the seals séguier and that man what has your eminence done with him what man asked the cardinal				17.662070484457036
it was the man of meung				54923.693157941714
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him				6.4233042183457405
bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of d artagnan				1.0603041653111391
bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous gestures				49622.970941929234
porthos placed his hand on the pistols				1680.2770062558898
i know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the daughter of danglars what				212.0152024715726
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water				6116.936982743377
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied d artagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia				19962.37742826109
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me edmond replied who knows				2196.620771592391
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent				4656.929847921733
let us go to monsieur de beaufort the two friends went to the hotel de vendome				12700.517768279184
i am a man of order sir let us do things in order nevertheless replied mordaunt i could compel you i command here ah sir said d artagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us				119.07149619904376
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the other well done planchet				341.1894831765216
athos pointed to the bastion				1050.20870916303
peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl				7613.769193497487
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else they continued their route				6835.934245225229
but all these reasons were combated destroyed overthrown by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over us				127.79289404719314
our béarnais was a prudent lad however young he might be				95.6993119866994
their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threatenings				41972.84966333183
let us choose a place of rendezvous continued athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other good the other three exclaimed				5388.354012537572
has your husband any spanish bonds he asked of the baroness				390.28787702164357
but my dear count has m danglars any reason ah				76.573138698872
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach				809.7139382568795
you don t imagine he would consider a little thing like that at any rate said porthos i am glad to hear d artagnan admit that he is afraid i not only confess it but am proud of it returned the gascon i m not such a rhinoceros as you are				85.81896250005626
what is the matter then with this dear child				204.05701280265168
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy				163904.47541574712
i will not talk here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner				247.35161133641512
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz				215.89292393626815
what this one too he exclaimed				80.6134576258559
free without my aid				5320.592674325924
you have water woods flowers there she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color				1974.566674699384
this being understood let us proceed with our history				1855.0717149479724
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès				139.5488296949424
andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him				3.4291504904560286
the queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke thus				875.2356964605864
and as for me said porthos i swear nothing but i m choked				3715.0808347862244
no one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said ali bring me my pistols with the ivory cross ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot				21753.973057560503
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit				12635.473043413682
danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon				3501.3434732125256
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room				28.55521388552055
ali observed his master as the nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative				1255.1205182601232
the devil take the madman murmured m de tréville unless added he this is a cunning mode of escaping seeing that he had failed in his purpose chapter iv				109.93331165426032
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the report				9413.718550308467
holà bazin				82.11448509942883
penelon said the captain i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold i gave him the helm and descended there was already three feet of water				8613.949069549231
every career is open to you				18.70765253795114
if i am a prisoner what crime have i committed you are here in the apartment destined for you madame				250.4725378379437
however we shall see				128.3627584275676
it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration				14278.949542710046
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces				6574.179108145288
contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he entered				268.27354766330245
he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover porthos with ridicule				5929.055254129249
no monsieur				167.01489502119747
i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london and i say to you live sire it is the will of heaven the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked				63741.52753230005
i am a frondist from my heart				1708.5818529314824
what has he done madame said d artagnan				1.0321243999125371
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health				2135.985041519206
when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men				1074.6872473286949
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurator s wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears i madame said porthos drawing himself up proudly how so the signs just now and the holy water				3101.2079211197497
i did replied the count				9.122441410782908
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor s emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone				350.0064703695639
your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobility of france would demand an explanation of your disappearance				1076.6281116794646
i have chosen the drawing room sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker s study				845.5984434674667
bazin was then at the height of joy				300.0327856396233
dantès was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead				647.4774540263319
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis				51.09914655296967
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground				58.125885782362836
you are not convinced yet i hope at least that you may be mistaken shall you see the king again perhaps would you pass in his eyes for a prophet prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man well what should i say to the king say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble				16050.151809289375
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister				1060.063912697034
the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing i know but added he seriously you understand it is on the king s service at your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one				434.3874766977512
who is he come come you won t tell me you don t know aramis this is the first time i ever heard his name pronounced it is the first time then that you ever went to that house undoubtedly and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man no by a musketeer no indeed it was not he then you came to seek not the least in the world				58.085350563199306
bonacieux was the very life of d artagnan				1.087004302805618
what is to be done my god my god murmured the young woman ought i to confide such a secret to you monsieur				111.99330605835628
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after albert s departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy				8900.92263574794
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly francs and have those francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrel s correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision				4577.88013687793
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation				9049.200327092176
his wife				29.690246639137015
and the headsman of bethune gave me a reply de winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply				424.3242946368357
i m hit in the other side				888.7236557862873
speak you condemned me to a horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness who are you then				79.10938298630944
planchet had no need to learn more				2736.157871050451
i mean the russian prince who you said had livres and we only found you must have searched badly luigi vampa himself searched in that case he must either have paid his debts a russian do that or spent the money possibly after all certainly				633.2617636618422
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters				1791.8202845617857
d artagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold				389.42902400910816
but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years what he did during these ten years god only knows				1018.5108781798018
i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper				6734.7297308152665
i am sure he will look like the great mogul they made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses				626.5197521836959
the world excuses and notoriety ennobles you madame replied villefort you know that i am no hypocrite or at least that i never deceive without a reason				1068.9207909263368
the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward				11323.459559472092
i have sent for one replied the abbé				21.990729860238382
a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest				589.0617277867312
i should be glad however to receive your excellency s commands concerning the dinner really my dear m bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so				10.970669324215248
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention				1477.7331002144394
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming				2433.1378237360054
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him				9.692993575216477
planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by night				329.3916307364926
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her embarkation				68587.21299087888
i have warned you				5.974341705925838
by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide				28421.68269516451
villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue				617.1874618927412
belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward				30365.056921258245
i am parched with thirst				7208.7574057242155
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face				163.18894712625453
no that is sufficient a man can pass through that porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through				1362.0703157510357
and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity curiosity that is a terrible word why so				10.416481097231266
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward m noirtier i will suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but i shall remain firm in my determination and the world shall see which party has reason on his side				461.13455666299586
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom house officers				6067.355370636359
he took his way toward the hôtel of m de tréville his visit of the day before it is to be remembered had been very short and very little explicative				61276.24846703809
parry parted from his friends regretfully they had proposed his going with them to france but he had straightway declined				271620.7874001066
give the lackeys money and they will start we will give them money replied athos				4.372645231577317
do you refuse said mercédès in a tremulous voice				18.11261380903616
mazarin leaned out of the window				53.38205759883312
as to grimaud he received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to reload their weapons				5826.094276666115
listen whispered villefort to valentine who could not conceal her joy if m noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay your marriage i forbid you to understand him valentine blushed but did not answer				116.6148149458609

the closet into which d artagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see				8882.080978469587
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime villefort tried to smile				1900.3669979428994

this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially				37543.46560021087

your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance				5024.333043824103
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty				28948.604635340445

ah very well replied the cardinal quickly				149.24432331318982

the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day				126.46466730223445
be it understood we are speaking of athos				31.142541892186678
rue de la fontaine in a room hung with red damask my father took me in his arms telling my mother i was dead wrapped me in a napkin marked with an h and an n and carried me into a garden where he buried me alive a shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of m de villefort				2.8234477404839082

he remained there some time alone				260.38453997312877
oh as for that i ll take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horse s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him				3.7179921743083377
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex				8857.322067813007
i thought you would never come in what s the matter now planchet demanded d artagnan				1.0367928760259897

mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed				424.7925504102613
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose				282.48629263718396
courage take courage my dear mother said the girl				1135.3011064952623

i have known you four days i have loved him four years				1834.7415904285353
monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give francs apiece for his horses				660.8654742445093
but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle				12938.100280660714

as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly				7978.514823105349
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force				2426.327654663311

gentlemen said aramis decidedly it is a night for meetings				3571734.934359362
julie suitably dressed and her hair arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes received the count on his entrance				983.1159251485958

while he was doing this d artagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared				314.7243144647758
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum				4900.213589663589
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life				457.209676993007
a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercédès the old man sank into a chair				147.04853620854308

he looked around he was in a court surrounded by high walls he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the light he saw the barrels of their muskets shine				4338.757617020344
the inspector listened attentively then turning to the governor observed he will become religious he is already more gentle he is afraid and retreated before the bayonets madmen are not afraid of anything i made some curious observations on this at charenton then turning to the prisoner what is it you want said he				33.15583753755926
monsieur d artagnan cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy monsieur d artagnan				1.2074840100411326
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream				164128.93595644805
come here grimaud said athos				3.526598386518494
no doubt you come to join the princes as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud				233.5223028325842
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection				728.1551787055678
a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped peppino opened the door and the count and franz alighted				6220.901368112527
if i bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of england what is your name then asked mazarin				38.01490483614297
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance				365.3688957484349
her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or death				379.9345889441614
well this is what you have to say said d artagnan my lord your sister in law is an infamous woman who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth but she could not marry your brother being already married in france and having been d artagnan stopped as if seeking for the word and looked at athos				58.33399322141847
about forty leagues only				310.0521748055919
it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net				112246.99890082415
then i have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees				172643.6213307817
the count was asked what time he required to prepare his defence				42084.07566490316
restore my brother to peace and happiness whispered julie to monte cristo				1.098363755876168
he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney				50591.225543472174
well sir at last said anne of austria you are silent after rendering such a service madame replied d artagnan i have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majesty s service and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you i know that sir i have known that said the queen a long time therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem permit me madame said d artagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville he has done wonders his name asked the queen				9.116094912605952
several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of cucumetto				536.5473521941952
rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught all these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo de medici				2497.0647178628005
i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much you have rightly guessed madame replied the count				5.659129989538149
he causes a disturbance in your hostelry which respectable people can not put up with				252.73728251131485
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean it means that i have just returned from yanina from yanina yes impossible here is my passport examine the visa geneva milan venice trieste delvino yanina				7671.574963694557
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope you re preparing a pretty trial why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume i should think not indeed				177.59121555516145
this is all very easy for you to say replied d artagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect but for me who am without any settled means and without resources for me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet this is serious answered the three friends it is a family affair				710.3462351109478
thomson french inquired the stranger				166.51725759143017
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden				182.7159843333281
madame said villefort i ask where is m d avrigny				34.731870658161405
once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling				3416.081941694773
d artagnan s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract				78794.62233139
now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations				29258.01534454087
the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat				33084.88271013927
this reasoning seemed to d artagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted and about eight o clock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the hotel de la chevrette and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate				1222.55286127859
it matters little now to me				9.202180438926575
why did not the countess the proud mercédès the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour ah baron baron said albert you are not listening what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you oh don t worry about me sir mocker said danglars then turning to monte cristo he said but will you undertake to speak to the father willingly if you wish it but let it be done explicitly and positively				116065.62126982647
an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn				80.97011711106985
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale				210.12448042240635
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos				798.0268613240922
for us also inquired athos				3.448805469142129
you were seated upon cushions in the spanish fashion you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful arms those lovely arms with large diamonds				2995.111984484745
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brother in law monsieur de tréville is particularly attached to their majesties				136728.2079803741
tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned i am pleased sir to hear that and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned but you will be resigned my friend never he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself				121.62452149851939
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword tis well said athos i will take care of that they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent				297.7727308338518
a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by morcerf				428.10321320083983
but to you d artagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend				37.961368459532984
franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a sea gull on the wave continuing her flight towards corsica				1672.7775611877412
take this said madame de villefort giving her smelling bottle to valentine				1753.6067917654016
count said villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes				91302.82324484766
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate				2277.21417601603
mordaunt went away with the captain				449.62748028184916
before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there				262.34581148319
how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which i had counted a little i must confess for the time i have to pass here no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued well said milady what can those who sleep wish for a happy awakening				37916.091342061474
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done				114.83703782323303
they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments				44381.44617870248
various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended				1445.9408325353531
have you not perceived it it may be but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be won oh difficulties do not affright me said d artagnan				1.032856582807215
before he had taken ten steps beyond the door i had examined the house on all sides				958.6506053048176
bridle in mouth said d artagnan				1.0460243235293842
at that moment d artagnan passed in pursuit of milady he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look				168.9546082832136
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen				53369.38785811319
the abbé told us it was worth without the setting what was the abbé s name asked the indefatigable questioner				7436.885752142558
you were deceived sir i was not praying do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator				125781.068898479
d artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron				39556.50592384809
yes there is the sky here is the sea				386.06640485425214
oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch shall i write your deposition				3928.5503616454675
i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the priest				385.01502375327914
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund				454.26033716041064
these steps came on came fast				28230.34473561766
you are surprised at what you see here extremely but above all things i am a marvel to you i confess it i am still young am i not				36.500737927270706
chevalier said athos				3.021784279396237
have you observed said he to them what a blood red color the moon has to night no replied athos i thought it looked much the same as usual look again chevalier returned lord winter				61.15460877570346
chapter xxviii				114.76166002620641
he calls himself so				191.1540054421226
on the contrary observed d artagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible how so it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends said porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army				1280.3547213942716
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m de saint méran s and he arranged mentally while dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence				15394.103804887787
it s my spanish wine that has got into your head is it not				144.58187537923212
is your love returned i suppose so said andrea with a triumphant smile since i am accepted				7847.713730260427
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count bad replied athos very bad but you received it with enthusiasm as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear d herblay				795.2636892112762
this woman is certainly a great liar				219638.42055358255
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of that is true said porthos echoing d artagnan s sigh				663.5969366305978
it was done on purpose for me i am sure of it sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty				1530.7429603388714
bravo d artagnan				1.2880585292094802
it was the abode of the little abbé scarron				537.127668030584
milady s robe was not the less stained with blood in a second				1233.0301291456997
you know well that i don t like to leave things half finished conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis				196.51107742917762
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all				105.80615525905912
the history of athos s imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong				43068.14476674052
then we must fly said he				8.98262784733959
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another				234.54675578042261
franz took the letter and read tuesday evening at seven o clock descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you				75.1026796570173
you are the only man of whom i have heard her speak with interest albert rose and took his hat the count conducted him to the door				21.302649471718112
you must show me the proofs against him certainly but you will find terrible charges monsieur continued dantès i know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask				694.1035353144355
he was thunderstruck				231.61554182954146
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than before instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen				5719.791439426125
but however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his life s best happiest years for it is not life it is merely existence in prison				1522.8815928557838
besides my friend d artagnan has something to say to me privately have you not d artagnan d artagnan nodded his head and bazin retired after placing on the table the spanish wine				501.1187646615267
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her albert shook his head and looked thoughtful				251.12490173195192
my husband has five or six valises you shall choose the best				2115.3967883389287
see him there cold as marble and proud like his father				44.78819025308686
napoleon certainly he knew something of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii				440.26049286163794
had surrounded himself this second or rather this first king of france became desirous that he too should have his guard				533.9122373011912
it was a terrible moment for the young man				2.32758467337835
we must not do so no you do not sanction our project no there is another way said morrel				30.289711075854783
that s too many gentlemen too many				745010.3947971476
the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii				1716.4726120993769
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock				1775.9774187460555
there was a moment of frozen silence between these two				1580.255249612158
then compelled to quit rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history				3671.700785762687
oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge				4931.643139353597
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him				5.177659661204272
though danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation				7341.150397507733
we have promised and we will keep our promise				633.041972938283
you speak first oh no				78.70584413410612
well resumed the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of caderousse s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine				286.2565638124817
but i as you see am nailed to my bed ah				67.2512773442472
yes very well				16.656426465727414
excellencies said he the coach is ready well then said franz let us to the colosseum by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies by the streets morbleu by the streets cried franz				31.042384653221944
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe				14828.81018806024
of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams				502.9930165052167
the queen entered				23.317313374467894
i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes returned d artagnan				1.0651347627071952
what said monte cristo				1.1292567237476427
permit me to inform you count said he bowing that i have received a letter of advice from thomson french of rome i am glad to hear it baron for i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the manner of your servants				655.7235163416084
a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way				395.83296519228344
here he said i am very straightforward in my dealings take your choice the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs				299.477914111024
a high wall at the angle of which was the pavilion ran along one side of this lane and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers by				5628.247309608601
friendship throws out deep roots in honest hearts d artagnan				1.0595525487508763
what do you say				29.601329923276822
he formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future				598.735097847861
my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to life partly on my sister s account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance				451.48327893962687
de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother then said athos woe to de winter for the child had done no harm may the devil take me if the child be not dead said porthos				10.75745397671742
now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not				64.98888598609632
i beg you to return me that dispatch d artagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact				51465.01873694659
then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon				1055.9170170561001
after all continued d artagnan there was certainly one with aramis				196.32918891019682
patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn				336.25142634358014
i even think that with economy i could manage it with two thousand livres good god cried she two thousand livres				760.3457977756193
these details will guide her on her part and on your return i shall perhaps have some good news to tell you				10.386664940183064
and after this reasoning she slept easily				5147.574237774842
yes said grimaud				27.64055179250972
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified				23840.853505318875
perhaps if i employed my strength against women i might perchance find them weaker than myself and consequently conquer them but it is with men that i struggle and i am but a woman to them				34.5769206466005
pardon me monsieur but you are not my lord the duke of buckingham said mme				21.0527042203476
most likely said d artagnan i am one of his most faithful servants it appears that his eminence is anxious to prevent someone from crossing to england yes a certain d artagnan a béarnese gentleman who left paris in company with three of his friends with the intention of going to london do you know him personally asked the governor				127.80105978572853
they disobeyed orders i beg of your majesty then said athos calmly and not replying to mazarin to quash these arrests of messieurs d artagnan and du vallon what you ask is merely an affair of discipline and does not concern me said the queen				9.27974645440187
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris				135.80455218942657
yes you have a recipe for it an infallible one that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink yes said monte cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed may we inquire what is this recipe asked debray				71.17987697190506
this is something new replied the king				23.414938008011916
ah don t be angry i beg of you that would be useless you know what is agreed upon between you athos and me				71.97614628837623
i have during those five and twenty years spared no pains to understand the people of france and the interests which were confided to me and now when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach the power i hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms sire it is fatality murmured the minister feeling that the pressure of circumstances however light a thing to destiny was too much for any human strength to endure				3153.3992188602274
you can not understand the position we are in				523.7587360036792
ah my dear sir you will see whether a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person and andrea gliding through the court like a black shadow rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder				2633.541519065087
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m noirtier i know it is very bitter said valentine so bitter that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter				1361.0334818556805
perfectly well quite rested sir you are still growing athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth				1349.5843783961816

would you have given up the letter aramis said d artagnan				1.0278921126427265
as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it				8.812475973933028

what could be his intentions towards him				5.357968082217087

if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape patience said the abbé in a tone which made the dying man shudder have patience caderousse looked at him with amazement				280.9725637516475
however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be present unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity				29608.009918072275
he could not be mistaken milady was in it				59.458041662618065
she was mad with passion				42787.26295616991

but without taking any heed of the sword milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat				393.9954418057058
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m franz				26.705287102845585

you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage				1174.6517697101326
were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million				2857.537478224382
suppose that the supreme being after having created the world and fertilized chaos had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was good suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night then even then mercédès you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment mercédès looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude				5074.665043627144
woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that i ought to blush				204910.30098643294
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands				51.46010594794036
the storm still continued				417.4399020955579
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses i scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost me well somewhere about francs debray conveyed the count s reply to the baroness				303.6072601122256
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat				534.7183654659127
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head				31.83691934874442
porthos was discontented with his condition				12516.356212339266
i suffer horribly				419.08610531593166
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would i give up five years of my pay which i am never paid by the way to make the king five years older really				30644.976748132784
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door				16.02875441410075
i make a match				17916.819333457446
i can not resist doing so he must live zounds replied d artagnan why don t you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch				1155.372847871813
everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on board				13816.448923371714
my recovery lasted six months				7169.4927106889245
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring				1324.3718140666967
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur d artagnan there s not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him then my lord replied d artagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me be it so				26.542306434046925
the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands had doubled pomègue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board				18209.3846961499
if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon and d artagnan dressed himself in an instant				553.1282573754174
is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir				1021.3978625759415
but you my friend are you not going to change your dress no i shall go as i am				238.0599982992921
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part				3636.233840758096
i have already told you answered the abbé that i loathe the idea of shedding blood and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self preservation no matter				1360.7855897423583
the house may be suspected but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur d artagnan for i can affirm sire if i can believe what he says that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal was it not this d artagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmes déchaussés asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vexation				6488.559262652469
political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation				23017.436153423507
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns				9924.631749338925
and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver				2601.286540823
besides d artagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her				21.060455532355967
vanitas vanitatum according to your idea then my brain is turned				2407.2805225430798
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest d artagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the bastille go to				271.3558949565228
speak then i am all ears d artagnan related his adventure with mme				40.15355086530371
you say you fear nothing but death i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans and old age my end will be achieved before i grow old and madness i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom non bis in idem				189039.20408227167
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night s adventure i don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one				208.76135733500837
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly				7724.35172160319
that is the least we owe her that s true said athos but that concerns aramis well replied the latter blushing what must i say oh that s simple enough replied athos				4.5760987952682
how said bonacieux astonished				16.4683127183954
here are two other cavaliers as he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed				667.1119152974965
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine chapter lii				133.64988973462332
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to find their masters				634.4163125243236
never fear quarrels but seek adventures				1207041.751009345
on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped				864.0738085180237
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight o clock in the evening you are not here no money even if it be but five minutes past eight then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad				7423.903879736396
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father				4018.8875486443685
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe				708.9929865558689
general de quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took				16139.39165754574
with francs we can reach marseilles with francs are you sure albert oh as for that i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are made				329.5452772734041
now i travel a great deal particularly on this road and i wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune it seems to me said the host that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur bah i have passed perhaps ten times through chantilly and out of the ten times i have stopped three or four times at your house at least				804.5770029117701
the rendezvous d artagnan ran home immediately and although it was three o clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse he met with no misadventure				55650.40291631262
oh sir said she clasping her hands				50.12279616194444
i have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write				626.6834874235348
taste this and the mines of peru guzerat and golconda are opened to you				28.85506711250121
and now sir resumed mousqueton when he had rid himself of planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend s fat back now sir allow me to leave you for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded you this dear friend said d artagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me forgotten he cried mousqueton there s not a day sir that we don t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of monsieur de gassion or of monsieur de bassompierre on d artagnan s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life s disillusions				105811.26121479574
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets villefort went immediately				678.2956299294536
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young can not resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching				23652.45763177006
as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france				148.6630419413273
at this moment grimaud came in				133.68851523060113
athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to grimaud s ear				1931.5833847833253
come planchet let us pay a visit to the king s treasurer and then set off toward paris sir toward paris and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain				44026.199054716446
did i not tell you that she was the goddaughter of monsieur laporte the confidential man of the queen				22.537519326951347
patience cried athos one of our party is still wanting the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be				79.30351337831489
what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize you your father s name so well known in italy and so highly honored				16112.60153493203
don t you say dear d artagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her i believe so at least in that case porthos will assist us and how so if you please why by your marchioness your duchess your princess				814.2416232147455
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides				5618.583353983095
he was discovered all hope of flight was gone				382.6727828528762
and having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer the needs of the moment he placed the others in the ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl in which was the famous handkerchief which served him as a talisman				37571.11665024348
the juncture was favorable				2797.616155945149
oh those villeforts are an accursed race truly they are murmured the count in a lugubrious tone				624.6723355519154
come accept my invitation and my mother will thank you a thousand thanks said the count your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it				6.051303939767454
i would almost answer for planchet well my dear friend add to his natural devotedness a good sum of money and then instead of answering for him once answer for him twice why good god				136.83418118285272
now albert said he you understand me do you not				27.083771154206666
and then her thoughts cleaving through space like a bird in the air rested on cavalcanti				2170.1123466290696
you did not see her				44.49114727338426
the next day monday was the first sitting of the assizes				18314.035494619537
athos collected himself and in proportion as he did so d artagnan saw that he became pale				64.91616426012804
apropos when do you aspect m d épinay five or six days hence at the latest and when is he to be married immediately on the arrival of m and madame de saint méran bring him to see me				12.522921823226081
are you there now certes replied aramis in a pleased tone but the thing is subtle the fingers resumed the jesuit st				4294.184469123029
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice men fear him and spare him i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy				1013.2115501004993
not at all why should i the countess placed herself before monte cristo still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed grapes				7672.899307297764

athos after making sure that lord winter was really dead let fall the corpse and said come aramis now for the honor of france and the two englishmen who were nearest to them fell mortally wounded				2905.033638445443
oh i would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists say our masters in everything those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities but said franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law				2013.122702849214

when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodière he arrived at m danglars door just at the same time that villefort s landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own house				188.5766987682382

i always said that d artagnan had the longest head of the four said athos who having uttered his opinion to which d artagnan replied with a bow immediately resumed his accustomed silence				372.8993400687441
it was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned for as soon as d artagnan appeared before even he had asked if milady were visible one of them ran to announce him				3.878281326553276

i m not the man you take me for you are in captain rogers s post are you not				58.858102747158306
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes				47.1677170473993

come he said tis a warning from heaven				61.54362101532489
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations				10262.3050534279

d artagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked for nothing had led him to the examination that the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and horses				303.11905018388006
poor woman poor woman what have they done with you you have promised to be secret my good monsieur said the old man				1.960985342151887
stop my friend i have an idea speak monsieur in your place i would do one thing what while his eminence was seeking for me in paris i would take without sound of drum or trumpet the road to picardy and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions				725.744669053109
remember raoul this				132.4001758749656
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness				960.839506544527
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also				321.21339809177067
there was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither mme				28.76206773425752
poor things here i am in their name said m de boville but did you receive my letter yesterday yes i have brought my receipt my dear m de boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twenty four hours since m de monte cristo whom you just saw leaving here you did see him i think yes well well m de monte cristo has just carried off their five millions how so the count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by thomson french of rome he came to demand five millions at once which i paid him with checks on the bank				255.8847954555566
gondy bowed respectfully				628.6396607135415
although the musketeer was not expected before one o clock the procurator s wife had been on the watch ever since midday reckoning that the heart or perhaps the stomach of her lover would bring him before his time				176.7209599200112
i saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mother s servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction				15627.864104552034
at drake s or aaron s one pays twenty five lire for common days and thirty or thirty five lire a day more for sundays and feast days add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and there s an end of it i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage then they must put horses to mine				1673.3575478076614
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night				307.15972155892956
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground				423.3154465442835
go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have no need of your service				291.7873812465505
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending				1370.2784692678322
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said				10.239059641953455
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes because you do not love me madame				116.54027076420793
and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel				4024.7328451809667
his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercédès exercised over him				6.335639089430291
ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may to be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said aramis				16.07241386308854
i pardon you and i weep for you				6.723254212878655
go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister de longueville that i thank her for the present that she made me of you and i came sir added raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for i thought you would be glad to see me again athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter				2622.8177841726083
my clothes were near me on a chair i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed				574.3599127890471
although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper beauchamp as it sometimes we may say often happens was his intimate friend				311.3623231074097
all this savors of his eminence a league off but what is to be done said d artagnan				1.0422993908719773
this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy				79958.70817787941
as you will replied the duke				12.44259360886157
albert beauchamp and château renaud remained alone				93.27997276232281
in the rue de vaugirard in the rue de la harpe that s well said the cardinal				22.123177284991872
have you traded it for your diamond no				356.8448937658302
peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly				1868.062630728275
athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the half curtains closely drawn				19713.351718776652
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant				13654.531780423347
at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me i have great power more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs élysées				47.29760299686546
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face				130.71485413316793
ah yes that is the name certainly				3149.570225023014
it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formed it was none of these things that attracted the attention it was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdain these were what fixed the attention of all upon him				6.880481571566323
he still lives are you quite sure of it i am he there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature				2742.8395655569116
come cheer up is there anything that i can do for you i wish to see the governor i have already told you it was impossible why so because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it what is allowed then better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but i wish to see the governor if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hunger that is all the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone				715.7554144027786
on guard but said he whom d artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st germain or in the pré aux clercs what you say is full of sense replied d artagnan but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely				2906.0214739135454
is he rich he s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in london and knows lansquenet adores it basset his mania biribi revels in it good said porthos we shall pass an agreeable evening the more so as it will be the prelude to a better how so we invite him to play to night he has invited us in return to morrow				586.372777628251
and for what kind of talent are they celebrated				110176.66402483752
then he said to himself i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody				40354.002439067786
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless				6610.435651140402
oh for pity s sake you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel one of my friends had not stopped him listen to me my son has also guessed who you are he attributes his father s misfortunes to you madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunes it is a punishment				758.0079794047077
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father				204.86280033763703
you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled has he eaten anything lately asked madame de villefort eluding her husband s question				185.55051441489158
the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the château d if dantès nevertheless determined to make for them				26.529849173858718
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh				2894.7292381254633
did he take baptistin with him no my lord call him then i wish to speak to him the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an instant				500.6313007766533
besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this				1288.010247495185
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out				54.31952700852012
now hastily interrupted the jesuit on seeing that his acolyte was going astray now your thesis would please the ladies it would have the success of one of monsieur patru s pleadings please god cried aramis transported				1790.8533573995603
morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your knees on your knees he is our benefactor the saviour of our father				133.75419143869954
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact but the feeling in dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in provence or languedoc				5741.07746593155
the next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill edmond hoped he was dying				1000.7432843177743
for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey				28188.188599446818
well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier				1130.9003316559815
these men are going to behead your father				44.924556901516375
in former days i had not only three friends i had thirty at two and twenty one calls every man one s friend well sir returned mazarin prudence is a fine thing but to day you might regret having been too prudent my lord pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues but you have been silent for twenty years sir				493.1504239766951
it was one of the gascon s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty				8598.691096027693
the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of france				88.6627562084889
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton ah sir				33.67671343370491
come courage				155.64768506920538
gentlemen said d artagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said porthos and that will be a pity				2249.5722566217796
a poor musketeer a beggar an unknown who hates slavery and finds himself ill placed in the world aramis aramis cried d artagnan looking at his friend with an air of doubt				1904.201222744991
thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it the devil it does				173.89025423561324
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut i wish we were already there said d artagnan and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our horses come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five o clock in the morning				175.5664957361073
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for heretics in truth said athos aramis is right				278.8907907958381
maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtier s eyes seemed to say quicker quicker in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentine s				191.71987607605618
i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her thank you sir said d avrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it				6.639264562992003
tell him to come to me immediately if he has returned the count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your eminence instantly let him come in then said the cardinal quickly				101.24991413229156
i do not remember if it is exactly francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference				31940.640772922095
wretch she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it				11.132608365859078
besides with these men s clothes will you dress here certainly shall you have time do not be uneasy you little coward				5611.6646954194075
beauty has always been and always will be all powerful				755.9519742618336
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman				786.9890393062357
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis				13.672271404740568
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory				14660.452763679628
at the end of two hours as porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their journey				351.7812215988528
still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance				120.38089707927637
in the home of the witty abbé dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others				323.9635681111577
take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave i thank your majesty said aramis but under these robes i have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger go then sir and god keep you the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the ante rooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop s palace				1524.9613002413776
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted				8956.218534236048
finally d artagnan had entire faith in the bravery of planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne				538.9728627117556
the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop				563.256426636876
i know nothing about it you don t know i quit the seminary not at all this is my story then				151.188515894475
i had but one gerfalcon and he died day before yesterday indeed sire i wholly comprehend your disappointment				22976.862351351923
the good george said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy				1758.6461794388438
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face				166.48375348056976
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling				2133.3710905091943
you will accompany monsieur le vicomte till grimaud rejoins you				13.916623471249085
but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here and he glanced timidly at the count s blue coat				714.6388739829565
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears				747248.9757192996
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go on i listen sire said blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire mala ducis avi domum continued louis xviii still annotating				27556.067950133536
oh oh replied d artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution we must fly said the queen				9.431726002224863
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz				219.15904246143572
my young vicomte replied scarron i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive raoul blushed again				97.34889974973484
all at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of d artagnan				1.0648174306426919
my friend said she how came you here				133.41798928798318
however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles				510.6602120670032
it was the marquis de saint méran				37.347276860354675
i wrote to franz and were he here he would confirm every word i wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being and signor luigi vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said château renaud				4.116020638768297
although la rochelle was invested however certain success might appear thanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city the blockade might last a long time yet				4685.896208192672
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation				392.9962942134663
at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for mercy				6264.325439006997
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing				86494.65558647973
that is all i require				2684.5168388954157
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles				215.1547294069632
but excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile quite the contrary				6824.261717336426
overturn the world change its character yield to mad ideas be even criminal but live count i have your word said morrel coldly then taking out his watch he added it is half past eleven morrel can you intend it in my house under my very eyes then let me go said maximilian or i shall think you did not love me for my own sake but for yours and he arose				503.5420830677242
you think so do you and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible				270.119269860665
go on said the abbé it seems as if i were listening to the story of a dream				304.92986708506936
yes i am a man of honor said d artagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess it for i do possess it do i not entirely go on well i feel as if transformed a confession weighs on my mind a confession if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not without doubt then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me perhaps d artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to milady s but she evaded him				8.21631668591161
if so you can spare yourself the trouble no said mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other then what may it be to call for monsieur le coadjuteur the coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker				388325.93165663315
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian				10945.210828800464
do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving				123710.49841458697
our position is truly a strange one continued athos laughing				36.676129515410324
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway				11905.242802886572
you do not know that i remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the château d if				15.463213470326998
ah said groslow				462.49104623150095
mercédès drew near and plucked the fruit				1479.9988374754782
d artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handkerchief				1784.3921349110785
to come in the capacity of a cousin and seat himself every day at a good table to smooth the yellow wrinkled brow of the old procurator to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them bassette passe dix and lansquenet in their utmost nicety and winning from them by way of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour their savings of a month all this was enormously delightful to porthos				177.9729486904912
a woman with athos				26.332060813009953
sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison				1530.6356665761941
your eminence said comminges as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door				72.44698361485545
no my lord and i will set out at once				35.36969091870635
well laporte asked the queen				8.751598956713359
athos invited d artagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine o clock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve				146946.7038370509
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them				14.71013750659191
i must return to the minister s				19.281296492423014
coquenard they arose slowly from the table folded their napkins more slowly still bowed and retired				387.93853066055635
and according to his custom d artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him				7.658938622233743
very often the bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see a vessel and good fellows like us on board they come and demand hospitality of us you can t refuse help to a poor hunted devil we receive them and for greater security we stand out to sea				1681.5273721302888
d artagnan with a sudden accession of wrath seized the lad by the ear and led him apart with the injunction stay you where you are and don t you stir or i will pull this ear off				202.09208294769093
fortunately a mendicant passed who coming up to athos to ask charity athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going				191.44955752834545
well m de villefort how would you advise me to act asked he				19.644427170604008
i see you no longer i am dying help me				6.1653589671156555
she had already been an hour in this apartment they could not long delay bringing her a repast				1675.3503394364743
we say the gravel he trod under his feet for d artagnan made these reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which led from the camp to the village of angoutin				3475.116404045399
the jailer therefore only grumbled				53334.12787995473
debray who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglars rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while monte cristo unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife				138.20441063355423
my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs				72955.09625051563
athos smiled when he saw their bare swords he felt it was no longer to be a butchery but a fight and he resumed his usual good humor				193.17260911549184
you see we had each our mission said porthos mine was to guard you and i am doing so				14.833554116740695
neither gold nor rank you have given me all you can give me and from to day your debt is paid and mordaunt darted out of the general s tent his heart beating and his eyes sparkling with joy				176.81098012450934
we have only the vulture to deal with				242.59261440804806

mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at boulogne sur mer and promise me to set out to morrow morning i promise my lord replied mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave mordaunt bowed				301.99590448142663
it is understood of course that when we say the queen mazarin is meant				2405.8724847443245

mazarin followed the direction of his eyes and gently turned the hoop of the ring inside				2609.3205243367543
if you go out do not go out alone when you eat use every precaution				5182.151801036716
aramis had killed one of his adversaries but the other pressed him warmly				9871.572078294566
the king				28.040258768285888
it is my cousin cried the procurator s wife				96.64734777468506
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder				185.66760691897252
that is to say when you have received my instructions				129.76189557527601
he no longer loved her he adored her				50.99420058073498
i monseigneur replied milady				43.31549146786725
during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself				495.7306589839393
gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten				154.2183073471921
and why were you so affected at that story or rather fable which the count related because i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening my friend said the baroness				284.72480385025824
my dear athos you view things on the dark side methinks my dear fellow i mistrust women				2975.4947523160818
yes on the contrary they met and it was the viscount himself who conducted him to the bed of the dying man athos in his turn rising without speaking went and unhooked his sword				144.71430465161237
in an instant thanks to the lamp my chamber was once more lighted				27406.21065305969
a day or two of rest will set me up and i hope i shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises a peculiar smile passed over dantès lips he squeezed jacopo s hand warmly but nothing could shake his determination to remain and remain alone				222.9418324271439
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth				268.09183094132993
i understand that mazarin is at this very moment extremely uneasy as to the state of affairs that his orders are not respected like those of our former bugbear the deceased cardinal whose portrait as you see hangs yonder for whatever may be thought of him it must be allowed that richelieu was great i will not contradict you there said d artagnan				1.029370427001737
the duke de guise killed monsieur de coligny in the place royale and nothing was said of it ah things go on gaily then said porthos				17.14532987894927
mazarin was a cheat at the card table				245.86724519862335
women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris				74.06118577069172
since you say i am sold to cross the tyne reach scotland and rejoin lord montrose who will not sell you and what shall i do in scotland				10187.698024760828
d artagnan looked and was seized with pleasure				952.3916660822009
his noble nature felt that their ignorance was a sort of reflection upon them				14.89918601356694
you see i am calm and strong				23912.35283195305
our friends are become our most dangerous enemies athos				78.79164662500358
what is it the child conceals it but where did he find it in his mother s laboratory does his mother then keep poisons in her laboratory how can i tell				1839.0387415384591
then having blown out the lights the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the door of a dressing room which led by a side staircase down to the yard eugénie going first and holding with one arm the portmanteau which by the opposite handle mademoiselle d armilly scarcely raised with both hands				5078.0684074981455
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers				1716.6846109720493
i am cold i am hungry				865.3375807588101
albert extended his hand				20.142801043672083
caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder				1931.310773005827
come now recall the four cardinals that at the head of armies have equalled monsieur de guebriant and monsieur de gassion but a humpbacked general				1591.7405615634532
it is magnificent continued beauchamp to be able to exercise so much self control assuredly as for me i should have been incapable of it said château renaud with most significant coolness				2448.183352224147
chapter xlvi				155.77242227288818
a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon				363.6991513960918
m bonacieux had opened his door and seeing the apartment had returned to the man in the cloak whom he had left alone for an instant				759.8354830337746
so much the better young man				21.19277650587847
i was a witness of the last hours of charles i				25.987671226737604
did you not once refuse to undertake a journey to brussels for the queen ah				116.85778911960482
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep				193.9133155209353
adieu i entreat you doctor all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal				6146.9306368072785
he will answer you the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor				150.2951306570361
the general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported				8963.720949868191
this house isolated from the rest had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu				137.8355287072537
it was delightful weather				10852.828486714632
oh said d artagnan we don t now make war as we did formerly				21246.45610242306
i will take the five scraps of paper that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six millions between us				49.370968244857444
here and there a dog barked behind a door or an affrighted cat fled precipitately from the midst of the pavement to take refuge behind a pile of faggots from which retreat her eyes would shine like peridores				90159.5439154544
milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out				485.0443553989097
d artagnan led the way through the intricate windings and narrow alleys of the city and ere long they had reached the house in question				365.7942435197364
what do you say cried d artagnan				1.038695454131479
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine no				20.606511314292142
but after all resumed the abbess monsieur cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus and though she has the look of an angel we must not always judge people by the appearance good said milady to herself who knows				1703.0523850526772
luckily the man i had had most to do with was some minutes before he could speak so i took advantage of his silence to walk off have you seen d artagnan we got separated in the crowd and i could not find him again oh said athos satirically i saw him				15.412938503717855
he had entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be clothed and lodged though in a handsome manner but he claimed two hours a day to himself consecrated to an employment which would provide for his other wants				6218.9794657620505
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness				1027.3879359369832
he took monte cristo aside				842.4977910670762
the friends slid in through this congestion of embarkation and landed in their turn				231.14795744783825
i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party				1067.2655450970863
opinions held in common are a ready bond of union read again said the old man				2.1008349116271035
in the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddlehorses				2825.360103300731
i approached him and said in a low voice well since you know the corsicans so well you know that they always keep their word				368.69238600834143
i turned around i looked at the trees i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time				170.27973569945618
the news which filled the palace with tears and groans soon became known and spread itself throughout the city				376.4187458497872
there was no great cunning necessary				337542.7219391561
baron danglars follow me said the man				784.5086977809527
never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on peacefully				3477.248042667279
why so i play with monsieur du vallon every night				471.46176790830805
it is horrible indeed but no one assassinates the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage and d avrigny prepared to speak				211.96425584348788
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel				2231.216771083088
as soon as he arrives inform me				6.353367305862612
dividing the proceeds the apartment on the first floor of the house in the rue saint germain des prés where albert de morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious person				707.2938365003743
porthos uttered a deep groan				404.25143504259927
the monk entered the chamber and approached the bed of the wounded man				3.992980939001452
her elbows were placed upon a mean table and she leaned her head upon her two hands which were white as ivory				27013.268297016126
i will take him dead that s all a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse				4212.573447048573
are you going pray say everything that is kind to countess g on the part of her friend the vampire and what message shall i convey to the baroness that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening the third act had begun and during its progress the count of morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of madame danglars				11.36563630973091
where is he in my wife s chamber on the first flight where they are dressing his wounds his things and his bag are with him				11.596636103769644
the terrible moment had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not fail in the least				4703.464705482303
the soubrette said for your master i have no other master but you so a pretty little lass my faith is that soubrette d artagnan opened the letter and read these words a person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest				217.12166792794244
do you know sir these gentlemen are each of them worth fifteen hundred pounds oh be assured said mordaunt looking at them with an expression he vainly endeavoured to soften my soldiers will guard them and guard them well i promise you i shall take better care of them myself answered d artagnan besides all they require is a good room with sentinels or their simple parole that they will not attempt escape				855.8704868887304
the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa eugénie sat near her and cavalcanti was standing				3577.0847379548854
the crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and diamonds				459.24806528797694
now i don t set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at tyburn or sent for change of scene to the indies				25237.914245932872
for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions				3373.177631779507
the principal thing for her then was as we have said to keep mme				34.30241007312991
she lived in a small town with her brother who was a curate				21963.621417466424
will you have the goodness sir should you receive news from blois to send me a few lines about my little friend mademoiselle de la valliere about whose health when we left so much anxiety was felt				6246.047433784753
now grimaud you come here climb up to the window again and tell us if mordaunt is alone and whether he is preparing to go out or go to bed				593.9000983401404
quick kitty quick said d artagnan in a low voice as soon as the bolts were fast let me get out of the hôtel for if we leave her time to turn round she will have me killed by the servants but you can t go out so said kitty you are naked that s true said d artagnan then first thinking of the costume he found himself in that s true				1973.1266335164685
do you see that said the king				18.377131957995545
he again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound				3100.2143460884918
jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it and while jussac was recovering himself glided like a serpent beneath his blade and passed his sword through his body				499.8379486433566
in fact after taking a few drops of wine and a piece of bread charles weary of waiting for death had suddenly decided to go to meet it and had given the signal for movement				69370.42085667275
he was now a lieutenant				7508.735859458203
you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself				202.3164487916555
villefort thunderstruck fell upon his knees the child dropped from his arms and rolled on the floor by the side of its mother				4784.185635704816
but after all asked porthos who is milady a charming woman said athos sipping a glass of sparkling wine				735.2784643078944
fernand was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of ligny				13188.086061901166
i place no confidence in their hypocritical faces				5856.901206865096
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them				17.413062617643543
for instance you shall see how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea time ma foi i should like to smoke monte cristo took the gong and struck it once				1538.9420798408762
but go on beauchamp				772.4524589670425
aramis at this movement drew his sword				213.84491676628184
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter he opened a drawer and took out a purse				177.24909115128807
giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord for in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness d artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible				156.44265988116808
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp château renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else ah true a diplomatist observed debray				83.14678724539651
from that moment the old man s eyes were fixed on the door and did not quit it				13.749624237951942
as we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the abbé faria s pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading le drapeau blanc				4335.597518453183
i looked into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs his back was turned towards me so that i could not see the expression of his countenance neither should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hands				170.18435746769083
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength				3786.13298357331
he was well known at the hôtel of the musketeers where everyone considered him a good comrade				27496.792651441803
and blood too				470.4476160646899
and why i should like to know persisted caderousse should they put dantès in prison				1165.572247968487
two aces the englishman looked and was seized with astonishment				459.5628567869626
yes read it morrel opened the letter and read my dear maximilian there is a felucca for you at anchor				2522.9286266985237
happiness almost stifles me the two friends began to dance around the venerable st chrysostom kicking about famously the sheets of the thesis which had fallen on the floor				159.1384578988839
there must have been in his life some strange secret that no one knows but then by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or high position both sir he has both fortune and position both this must be impossible it would seem so but listen and you will understand				111.19915517314614
but if i were wrong i watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday i have been thinking of your firmness all night and i said to myself that justice must be on your side or man s countenance is no longer to be relied on but morrel albert is your friend simply an acquaintance sir you met on the same day you first saw me yes that is true but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me thank you morrel then ringing the bell once look said he to ali who came immediately take that to my solicitor				115199.7388149206
i should like to offer him a last salute				37188.11809269465
once or twice the thought crossed his mind that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his mind was made up when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to examine the opening he would kill him with his water jug				6892.26324591721
not at all				19.972353711241983
it was a chaise drawn by three horses driven by a postillion rochefort s lackey would precede it as courier				25844.99011231409
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him				4.205841209640686
and yet it is very hard added she that a man upon whose affection i thought i might depend treats me thus unkindly and will not comply with any of my fancies that is because your fancies go too far replied the triumphant bonacieux and i mistrust them well i will give it up then said the young woman sighing				4202.40558773429
why the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by god for each other my lord cried the queen you forget that i have never said that i love you but you have never told me that you did not love me and truly to speak such words to me would be on the part of your majesty too great an ingratitude				57767.02077279609
what do you ask of me said he your son s life				128.3754903505999
that s unworthy				1118.0607670075594
valentine uttered a cry of horror morrel took her in his arms as if to defend her from some unknown danger				463.31370319507954
by my soul said aramis she is charming				368.0937249400147
it s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young cavalcanti whom i do not really know at all but i do have you made inquiry is there any need of that				99.8280638445445
upon his return to the hotel franz found albert in his dressing gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar				9044.058314562752
must i use any password to procure a horse only dismount another will be immediately saddled albert hesitated a moment				197.81430163584756
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman the most satisfactory part of the matter said d artagnan is that there remains no trace of it she had a son observed athos				8.31220680595512
besides one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused in order to lash one s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power				1379.1797704128087
very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent english				7913.881690857748
the duchess is at tours and the duke at boulogne				288.06113210449416

well asked danglars				82.2188217276937
bonacieux and that he should find her next day at the louvre sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another who in a jealous fit had surprised her and carried her off				970.961057275259
i began to fear that he would not come				160.42132119513835
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered				107.42163738545635
i saw the executioner return into the king s room change his clothes put on a black hat and a large cloak and disappear				4870.814195025276
then you must have something on your mind said athos				3.7853888815299257
for the moment she wished nothing better				178.7989751209602
gentlemen thus d artagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him				6.204415619402233
what is he doing there said the inspector				50.922336903315745
i don t know much about it said athos				4.245418318541133
my adored valentine words can not express one half of my satisfaction valentine had approached or rather had placed her lips so near the fence that they nearly touched those of morrel which were pressed against the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier				1413.5775935948338
we are saved said valentine				224.3480119643399
felton made a slight bow and directed his steps toward the door				13.169468063894012
grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort				6094.43756550504
saint denis				31.18342083154499
the council of the musketeers chapter xlviii				163.18536769603648
ten minutes afterwards general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves				10607.895555753334
the lemonade morrel was in fact very happy				4357.371845047253
here they are monseigneur there was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it				27.360265766957067
two open ings have been made in these caves the treasure is in the furthest a ngle in the second which treasure i bequeath and leave en tire to him as my sole heir				1816.8057011143203
milady faltered d artagnan and fainted a second time				58.22111473180741
mademoiselle de villefort no longer requires help said d avrigny since she is dead dead dead groaned forth villefort in a paroxysm of grief which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron heart of that man				1470.420901768094
he then said it is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o clock but perhaps valentine will not wait for that consequently morrel having left the rue meslay at half past eight by his timepiece entered the clover field while the clock of saint philippe du roule was striking eight				3369.277772592642
he was a man of execution this worthy porthos				750.1288410614438
sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted up hem				27450.783625204276
and now when are we to go asked athos				4.392887112945402
he was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like lucius brutus have kissed his mother earth it was dark but at eleven o clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second pelion				5616.681479928214
dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress got in by his side				504.1528065860653
since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto				646.2276420388246
oh oh said d artagnan comprehending the slight frown of the musketeer				502.7398031389219

your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf s remark				26324.216941802264

one is for seven o clock and the other for eight there will be time for both hum				14792.693517717667
but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious				7910.712474005377
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls				20342.51541580639
d artagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice				138.91850714780375
attend to yourself answer me dantès waited expecting a question but in vain				112.46970613193486
he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present				1608.3393378819221

about three months ago i was near having a duel with aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house for a handkerchief marked in the same manner i am sure monsieur said the young woman you weary me very much i assure you with your questions but you madame prudent as you are think if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief and that handkerchief were to be seized would you not be compromised in what way				1087.9299608080023
what is the king doing they asked				43.895286522150556
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue férou drove up to the green door				96.57515947961147
let him pass d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard				390.5010240108638
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him				5.829568765260315
that is not probable it is possible said milady				37.98085960913035
my only fear is the chance of dantès being released				5054.268606464404
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again				512.620012786212

they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends				288.03750745402806

upon my soul everything degenerates and i don t know whether it is the game which leaves no scent or the dogs that have no noses				43305.83042453599
but aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke s finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him				25.32923100615573
d artagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions				26732.261311325667
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover				2881.121057361938
ah ah said he what does this mean this is the gentleman i am going to fight with said athos pointing to d artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture				246.76281692771929

well then said mordaunt i choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called comte de la fere calls himself athos athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends monsieur mordaunt a duel between us is impossible				309.60969686640897

he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing				32364.18168366225
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given				1264.6418892248166
bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband				406.19682990666416
we know the count s vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man				533.9578107118163
why you must have lost your senses whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel listen to me franz said albert i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us				65.28024605201378

at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore and holding a spy glass in his hand				11.800940431983246
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber				141.42908692994394
he was carried home in the arms of the people				514.5328645608976
at the language you use what do you find so astonishing in that language said milady smiling				19.545254960332144
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him				5.825972871781964

we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to speak				241.75217512651224

he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill d artagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts				8347.166267230949

felton darted into the palace				514.8617364591759
it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp				901.5747458522682

besides d artagnan has not told us his idea yet and the musketeer with his usual coolness reseated himself before the remains of the breakfast				8223.376544447003
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her				14.804822388873099

this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga wines				1197.8865280841096
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind				168.11962014934556
the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious and then that which was inconceivable in athos who was always retiring was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society those manners of a high degree which appeared as if unconsciously to himself in his least actions				1029.8442705264747
the next morning d artagnan ran to find athos				51.60243931574104
the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread				1110.0234934476878
his eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of the wall of which all the windows were closed with shutters except one on the first story				434.0493616528308
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway				7972.483242722368
you will not sign that order my lord said felton making a step toward the duke				58.015042125522804
monsieur de beaufort took the pieces out of his mouth and presented them with great formality to monsieur de chavigny saying that for that evening the entertainment was ended but in three months it should be repeated when pistache would have learned a few new tricks				19859.516634010604
if you make a single step to find her you are lost that s pretty positive continued d artagnan but after all it is but a menace yes but that menace terrifies me				4.903084478178708
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousin s with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required				10236.588005096708
but this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature concentrated and insensible by force of austerity				29310.519319299234
chapter xiv				118.43434416979208

the doctor closed the door after her with a gloomy air				263.80270953005333
they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the place of the sun so frequently absent in our climate				8530.961936312464
you have heard what i said				23.1247059016645

i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above another s				319.6081025711551
the cavalier in the gilt cuirass fell upon aramis and struck a blow that aramis parried with his wonted skill				4028.4538617614
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction				7997.590287442867

grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully				124.00821159462342
let us call one of these lackeys with a demi pistole in the left hand exactly so cried aramis				23.26867044301069
not even me asked the count with deep emotion				2788.825547345947
albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there				98.35843226774168
but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of d artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer				1104.816313639737
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queen s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty				14581.337129235091
i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him				8.144232973975837
but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature				3673.416974020285
well albert this money which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman i adored may now through strange and painful circumstances be devoted to the same purpose				462.4341522388613

she had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor				9221.820737877551
it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our mazarin impossible				113.14520882220987
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest				16611.059413462175
athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it				13.02356049835527
good caderousse he said how happy you will be i will do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife				1051.4874738871122
i willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon me				6.012896441539065
monsieur said d artagnan i beg you will have a care what you say for if you utter another word like that be you marquis duke prince or king i will thrust it down your throat				1257.795014601626

d avrigny took the young man s arm and led him out of the room				37.30496987176132
once in paris i shall prosecute my search for that unfortunate woman well you may be assured that your horse will not be half so serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis				849.8513038656262
do you think emmanuel would oblige me i will answer for him count well				172.43241120282178

i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an avenger you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes				5608.82366186991
well asked he				9.41876891368676
what do you think of the plan gentlemen admirable replied the young men in chorus				697.2765354848101
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris				118.9636673960064
at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room				123.34840741972684
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again				161.09758013219246
it is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son hasn t his mother s energy what my good fellow replied athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours ago he does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are				93.34640408653468
here are ten thousand more francs he said with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket they will make twenty five thousand				39453.35228078807
fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory				77531.23783757439
the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the nave				10783.632144864747
however there are plenty in the world but you don t look in the right direction for them my lord indeed				264.1221601840358
preparations were making on every side chairs were placed scaffolds were raised and windows were hung with flags				13664.406006965382
what with d artagnan grimaud and mousqueton we can manage to dispatch eight of them				65.77693752116237
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so				37.5746425266035
are you also the victim of a treachery no said the novice but of my devotion of a devotion to a woman i loved for whom i would have laid down my life for whom i would give it still and who has abandoned you is that it i have been sufficiently unjust to believe so but during the last two or three days i have obtained proof to the contrary for which i thank god for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me				12.244535382602637
mordaunt remained standing near the door				23.854940584390455
it is the password				52284.199993592105
buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs and avenge himself for that little treachery but buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy				9588.68249890162
hang it said groslow i thought i had succeeded better				121.86869362326722
within two leagues of this place at the inn of the red dovecot in that case i am lost said d artagnan				1.0436643352860484

the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow and knitted his brow like a man disquieted				21527.470872344984

they had seen no one				1484.2753063247035
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom				1383.8721341029955
what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will no sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses				2273.75725153476
but if he annoys you this young fool to be sure he does				300.90145461567306

five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to danglars house				313.61887727464307
undoubtedly madame said d artagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own				105.91680453140766

beauchamp related to the young man all the facts we have just narrated his story however had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living things over the coldness of dead things				850.6901605637868
it may be judged whether d artagnan looked or listened with avidity				17272.917048591553
in prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious				3635.127786289398
the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts				1352.380199128618
ah said porthos let us hear what he says d artagnan opened the letter and read as follows dear d artagnan dear du vallon my good friends perhaps this may be the last time that you will ever hear from me				6.150397032115001
they are contained in this box which you will not open until you are on the other side of the channel very well and you what will you do i i return to paris what without chastising this insolent boy asked the lady				829.7925009031005
they would have carried him to greenwich he said and put him on board a felucca with five barrels of powder in the hold				4737.326498480484
the siege of la rochelle is about to be resumed monseigneur				2461.0172483738306
of what nature why you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage certainly and i also know that we have done all that human means afforded to endeavor to get one now then in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my brain franz looked at albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination				1023.7549316462782
mordaunt drew a handkerchief from his pocket and tying a knot at each corner the signal agreed upon waved it in the air and the man came up to him				5.459168562363762
no you are right my dear rochefort it couldn t be for that but you will probably learn the reason soon ah indeed				72.43820961110312
before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying help a second blow struck him almost immediately in the side and he fell calling help murder then as he rolled on the ground his adversary seized him by the hair and struck him a third blow in the chest				10516.66518373482
she has a carriage then this niece of the doctor interrupted porthos one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue				8148.774801009203
believe me continued tréville in enterprises of this kind in order that one may arrive four must set out ah you are right monsieur said d artagnan but you know athos porthos and aramis and you know if i can dispose of them without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to know we are sworn once for all to implicit confidence and devotedness against all proof				1857.2702814898933
no well i shall see him to morrow and tell him about you but i m afraid entre nous that his liking for wine has aged and degraded him yes he used to drink a great deal replied porthos				12.124333451984564
neither had any				3391.2728756281913
no sire replied athos				3.1344636698307218
i wish after such a scene to be alone mazarin bent low before her				25.11929783494245
do you understand asked villefort				100.13771634092407
all england is with cromwell and since you ask for my prisoners i bend sir to your wishes				2841.8524226023333
d artagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past eight				2706.5601756546216
the executioner made a sign and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him				4.713896915060263
ah said aramis				12.789286474016976
you said only imagine and then paused				675.3416660530743
vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover				531.375192771106
franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment				232.34893691297728
the youth s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day				191.71009447538057
it looks as if you were trying to fleece me i				81.3256399894833
the blade of a dagger was buried up to the hilt in the left side of the executioner				1143.495778425845
fighting here are you				255.31440016645627
aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls				1206.8649505278795
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china				2862.5165908808904
the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms				387.07008169894567
but as we have said it was at least a league from the château d if to this island				4617.755446745512
this point settled the duke turned to d artagnan				1.0680577784185001
the other in the rue de la harpe no				48.231177573254136
let us pretend not to notice that he is watching us and spurring on he plunged into the labyrinth of streets which led to his hotel situated near the marais for having for so long a time lived near the place royale lord de winter naturally returned to lodge near his ancient dwelling				30891.926802361733
but be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody you hear him cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him				8.772483013343333
these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken				909.6451347246774
on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger				481.4014540065617
monsieur de beaufort told the guards who took him to vincennes that he had often thought what he should do in case he were put into prison and that he had found out forty ways of escaping my lord if among these forty there had been one good way he would have been out long ago come come not such a fool as i fancied thought mazarin				42.7031097598282
the count took out his watch				241.48925740756948
is he prosperous and happy he died a more wretched hopeless heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head				34.57462070839491
the duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter ah				547.7032801497529
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded				2249.4360304320994
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe				56539.87043727397
supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well supposing the assertion to be really true a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father s honor ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit that is precisely the fault of the age and do you undertake to reform it yes as far as i am personally concerned well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow yes i own it are you quite impervious to good advice not when it comes from a friend and do you account me that title certainly i do well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject from whom from haydée why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair what can she do in it she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition you reject this means of information then i do most decidedly then let me offer one more word of advice do so then but let it be the last you do not wish to hear it perhaps on the contrary i request it do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp visit him alone that would be contrary to all custom your case is not an ordinary one and what is your reason for advising me to go alone because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp explain yourself i will do so				10.742959936435547
now what is it they want to know				182.31851388423547
but it s of no importance continued d artagnan with natural assurance it s of no importance				1896.5748588538568
if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again				136.3167045427793
for soon perhaps i shall not hear and i shall die without knowing what she has written to me laporte made no further objection and read my lord by that which since i have known you have suffered by you and for you i conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against france to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause				1498.658236232806
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately				2126.464853136419
there is here no question of crime or treason				6537.840843272446
by notre dame				29.908852210960692
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling				1825.1658104732542
the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner				128.60383853582482
sir said d avrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentine s maid if you please villefort went himself to find her and d avrigny approached noirtier				70.10604749801142
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles				12380.355629695614
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach				8524.041213883102
why i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man				14.978129881927712
would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret				3304.746613715622
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips				56.372500972941666
yes madame said the young man				1.64025625597415
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve nay be not discouraged				10170.486562418873
during the daytime valentine s perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter s room and watched her with his paternal tenderness villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child				594.8932382943478
as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them				274.05032778756424
what is the matter sir asked monte cristo advancing to meet the commissioner				10857.279926804329
the watchword is king and ré saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendant for that night he himself slept in the camp				265.4342106565387
the others followed				242.2361281894256
ah indeed said d avrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to you noirtier did not let him finish				43189.7689894693
then internally if renée could see me i hope she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator well when we quitted naples captain leclere was attacked with a brain fever				1168.4681611059432
the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel				4480.247233012621
the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room				26.340022587030454
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage				248.59481397357524
yes i should expect so besides if they forget i shall take the liberty of reminding them the queen s voice				73.43075473709251
my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself				942.2664208161616
all gazed at him searchingly				23834.351778869506
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance				176.82801157389113
at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention				519.3652254395948
roman bandits chapter				1.0808672909588064
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her calm yourself				388.40163559180803
stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed				6191.243460927298
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said d artagnan				1.0370781424142046
then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression				305.68937305626054
do you want anything d artagnan shook his head and set off at full speed				518.1813113575619
i see				89.9691985026995
but said he did you observe one very singular thing what how attentively he looked at you at me yes albert reflected				321.3290596056528
you have seen my dear albert i ask the question as a mother you have seen m de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be what does he appear to be why you have just said a man of high distinction i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such but what is your own opinion albert i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese i do not ask you of his origin but what he is ah				65.03178907746904
but whom are you seeking debray i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man				1.7760991992498638
my sword is shorter than yours it s true but bah				783.2905084020495
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections				2670.839610549497
in this way we shall not be separated for an instant well go down to her then to make your request				7311.386355267132
you know it is you alone whom i love how can i know that by the scorn i will throw upon her d artagnan took a pen and wrote madame until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me your first two letters were addressed so unworthy did i feel myself of such an honor besides i was so seriously indisposed that i could not in any case have replied to them				39.213090767187055
at ten o clock every one was in his appointed position at half past ten the prince visited the posts and gave his final orders for the following day				85.82481449840957
rochefort he exclaimed you				671.9422283403694
m bonacieux who was ignorant that d artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m de laffemas whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinal s executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture				3872.264559342737
albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume				1010.5842817589411
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather no no no replied the eye of the paralytic				4074.2999668135235
i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers				21554.54668357032
my sister is happily married her husband is only my brother in law that is a man whom the ties of social life alone attach to me no one then longer needs my useless life				214.17749274357612
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too				1462.2339970973492
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant you who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris really				768.4165216793111
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of or livres				1037.771489469087
even his breathing seemed to be arrested				1223.1616216038783
i gave one to the sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father the pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the emperor napoleon to his predecessor pius vii				269.1936074405972
who goes asked the captain				48.70319198038853
i mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked it				254.13924565185852
eugénie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage				75.36355472951658
as a further precaution they had bound his hands				61.800377534605815
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily				75071.78767766237
and to you also m morrel my thanks are due				920.6956346755219
the idea of suicide which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence now hovered like a phantom over the abbé s dead body				225.73851744338904
the garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers				164.62797644490254
for a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him				11.585267073052828
i was just reading the name of the place when the wind blew my letter away i suppose to the spaniards there s no use in thinking any more about athos				100.7976770939588
but the latter went on without pity seek whom the crime will profit says an axiom of jurisprudence doctor cried villefort alas doctor how often has man s justice been deceived by those fatal words				468.360634836771
because replied franz you seem to me like a man who persecuted by society has a fearful account to settle with it ah responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth				1845.5341466673308
debray muttered albert				47.901511646532356
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known				642.7825484477031
what a splendid business that last case of yours was my dear villefort remarked a third i mean the trial of the man for murdering his father				71.95061606689747
yes and who is it said porthos				10.746128758071084
we have already observed with what rapidity d artagnan seized the expression of a countenance				400.04408928714383
they can t be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night				813.3832434046087
well repeated porthos				11.144673023005438
while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief				1741.7008195930248
well he asked that will do will it not yes my lord on one condition what that grimaud shall wait on us at table nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud				22613.693768263747
that woman that woman which the one with a white dress and so many diamonds the fair one madame danglars i do not know her name but it is she sir it is she whom do you mean the woman of the garden she that was enceinte she who was walking while she waited for bertuccio stood at the open door with his eyes starting and his hair on end				663.5839632226398
d artagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but athos raised his hand				20.07321442311123
chapter xxxix				81.02125230918342
he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the duke				237.83625025122697
let us talk a little said she				28.622174984604477
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected				154.31746711473755
i warn you however his services will cost you something				1744.3213797441438
in a few minutes porthos had rejoined his companions who were already in the boat but when after they had all got in it came to his turn there was great danger that in putting his huge leg over the edge of the boat he would upset the little vessel				1749.3674498936996
she was walking with her nurse marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback i stopped				347.09545836126784
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat				293.4985927964603
ah my dear replied d artagnan upon that very horse i came to paris what does monsieur know this horse said mousqueton				137.31950341551828
and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent said aramis				17.478031473002922

at one of the extremities of the camp near an immense tent in which the scottish officers were holding a kind of council presided over by lord leven their commander a man attired as a cavalier lay sleeping on the turf his right hand extended over his sword				114.75854087903663
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced				19890.544827196372
let me look at that sapphire again the one i mentioned to you had one of its faces scratched by accident d artagnan took off the ring giving it again to athos				117.75887335972175
the day passed away as rapidly as an hour				702.7976199111226
where are your passports we have none we left england ignorant of the state of politics here having left paris before the departure of the king ah said the sergeant with a cunning smile you are mazarinists who are sent as spies my dear friend here athos spoke rest assured if we were mazarinists we should come well prepared with every sort of passport				22772.175064143918

the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states				224.5436520299685
for the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman				463.52893430677284
as we have said he perfectly understood the old man s vocabulary and if he did not use it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing				3416.0330746001405
all is over				211.59889103318488
and how do you know it asked milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart				30.87526822880111
valentine summoned every effort and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep				366.3853211973602
the scheme goes forward it seems on wheels dear friend good				344.3813669376075

the parliament				124.27506411077368
already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de morcerf it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional circumstances detailed by debray				401.4361623848626
amidst all these alternations of hope and fear the clock struck ten				1324.7577227026748

ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know come i will reform and morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to m danglars said baron i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugénie danglars for my son the vicomte albert de morcerf but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer to reflect said morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them i do not understand you baron said morcerf				94.58365961228397
and is not this daughter dead demanded monte cristo i fancy i have heard so yes monsieur one and twenty years ago and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three times thanks thanks said monte cristo judging from the steward s utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it				74.912223997921
if he defers he will find the place of honor taken shall i send word to him as coming from you yes certainly shall i tell him that he can count on you to the end and you will leave the command to him of the war yes but in politics you must know it is not his element he must leave me to negotiate for my cardinal s hat in my own fashion you care about it then so much since they force me to wear a hat of a form which does not become me said gondy i wish at least that the hat should be red one must not dispute matters of taste and colors said rochefort laughing				2770.245034279845
but what is the meaning of all these questions to tell you my lord that the moment has now arrived when with a single word you may recompense all these services oh said oliver with a slight curl of his lip i forgot that every service merits some reward and that up to this moment you have not been paid sir i can take my pay at this moment to the full extent of my wishes how is that i have the payment under my hand i almost possess it what is it				33.74406500566769

the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand in whom the grand vizier ali tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence well said monte cristo what do you see in that to annoy you what do i see in it yes what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer it signifies to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name is fernand did your father serve under ali pasha yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny oh my dear viscount do talk reason i do not desire to do otherwise now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person				380.01739125261963

well for my part said athos i found aramis s spanish wine so good that i sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lackeys				4432.728010767934
but the mind of the procureur was made up he felt assured that benedetto was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his self love which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen heart				150.44412704031305
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate				25072.71983881167
it is not he				296.717496141398

besides in accepting it she added in a voice full of emotion you render me a much greater service than you imagine this woman is full of mysteries murmured d artagnan to himself				30.294990547344504
de chavigny who according to report was a son of richelieu s and had been a creature of the late cardinal s understood tyranny				97104.35351472994
diplomat or not i don t know i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly				2082.7396342023562
he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act my lord said d artagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d herblay who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis				67.71370787207557
fie pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher higher				97069.16963774325
one hour s rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man s bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence seemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future				986.0582023591426

you are mistaken it is olivain who leaves me you are to remain on the contrary olivain is to stay and i am to go				511.01706678059674
this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued				3435.494917364565
can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities he resolved to end his anxiety				5110.770299321531
dantès struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices				8185.998496029649
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as d artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but d artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line				1305.7338417535857
after having well beaten him he forbade him to leave his service without his permission				3830.799254271617
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself				589.5863764209788
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake				14188.20633835397
the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court				1522.3036739821632
the house to which d artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening				72.75460542524527
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimaud s shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them				19.25073676624192
bring her in said the president				33.20472624591074
listen beauchamp				76.38940739646347
nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us you re right yes let us go on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate				516.3669152259894
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort				995.7172817715056
only warn him that it is you why should i do that because monsieur some mischief might happen to you of what kind in the name of wonder monsieur porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains what have you done to him then we have asked him for money the devil				291.2859524049561
he now arose his head bowed beneath the weight of grief and shaking his damp dishevelled hair he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes someone by whose side he might weep				9584.129628980787
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject				5957.383342713857
in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another				734.7671049979566
the litter borne by two servants now entered the house				87.45836014349891
chapter lxiii				37.59691097745891
tis a last resource but let us not employ it till it is imperatively called for let us rather persevere in our researches they continued their inquiries and at last met with a light dragoon who had formed one of the guard which had escorted d artagnan to rueil				10317.307482250957
what have i done then				49.19584523965457
the only time i have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at windsor				7952.284487721906
yes indeed count said madame danglars and tell me did you ever see at the court of ali tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer costume did i hear rightly monsieur said monte cristo that you served at yanina i was inspector general of the pasha s troops replied morcerf and it is no secret that i owe my fortune such as it is to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief but look exclaimed madame danglars				14.518180441850612

your daughter will be married tomorrow if not today in a week if not tomorrow and i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter madame danglars gazed on villefort stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm				1165.3605119142878
if you know a prayer say it for you are condemned and you shall die at these words which left no hope milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak but her strength failed her				24.648163072322884
nothing said milady smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile				227.2849874530752
and i a plain chicken said aramis				20.065922147269966

friquet had put on his sunday clothes under the pretext of having a swollen face which he had managed to simulate by introducing a handful of cherry kernels into one side of his mouth and had procured a whole holiday from bazin				1359.6881391761526
he said he was going to the catalans and he is going to the city				622.7513724169559
reload the muskets grimaud said athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our conversation				386.90437386029777
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life				360.90599240275213
he had a haughty bearing a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial				9718.14754543773

raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell				650.6169125827405
and yet i have punished her i have dared to tell her i have repent and die but no she must not die she shall live and with me				33.373906529656956
listen hermine i consider myself as brave as most men but when i drew from my breast the little key of the staircase which i had found in my coat that little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring when i opened the door and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre i leaned against the wall and nearly shrieked				5056.418839987359
albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done				145.4666154654582
now mazarin was alone and defenceless as he well knew				1976.424278150379
it had glided down it tearing the robe and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs				55591.47075017418
yes i have something of the highest importance to tell you true said he and i have some questions sufficiently serious to put to you				14.210470656139178
around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette				6976.13448847379
and i he said i feel that my place is not in the judge s seat but on the prisoner s bench you said madame danglars				9.684278131459987

instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a letter				344.11544325228465
god bless his majesty yes repeated the leader in a whisper god bless his majesty and all these men who had entered enraged passed from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their turn				175.226015917169

oh monsieur chevalier do you love that woman still no no it is one of my friends who loves her monsieur athos this gentleman here i cried athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an adder				16072.024549439293
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource				6123.205441975177
he immediately ran in the direction of portsmouth which he saw at nearly half a league before him standing out in the haze of the morning with its houses and towers				2941.4967573956887
thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands				62.339250255006085
as he passed by m noirtier s room he perceived two figures through the half open door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further				960.4799151252115
no one had entered the house since i had left it				6.082024803724023

they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood				400.75757954549397
the procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit as he expressed no surprise at the sight of porthos who advanced toward him with a sufficiently easy air and saluted him courteously				12629.027870295273
but grimaud s ingenuity was more prolific than his speech and therefore at the first halt he sold his steed and with the money obtained from the purchase took post horses				531.0532450765251
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor that in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them				13.813852092762232
old dantès was dead and mercédès had disappeared				99.27925434573342
the ballet was called poliska				1059.407500267841

friquet whose eye ever on the alert could alone have discovered them had gone to devour his apricots upon the entablature of a house in the square of notre dame				59.47358048111189
the spectators saw the muskets leveled at them and divided between fear and curiosity remained noisy and excited				1102.7478596930814
he buried his brow in his hands and thought of the world so beautiful when one is about to leave it of the caresses of children so pleasing and so sweet especially when one is parting from his children never to see them again then of his wife the noble and courageous woman who had sustained him to the last moment				204.76084133011886
an event took place in the church of st louis au marais				8262.60349850821
at length a hand and an arm surpassingly beautiful in their form and whiteness glided through the tapestry				3911.1301407870405
it was brought to me				9.185374629732008
from pure zeal resumed mazarin with his artful smile from pure zeal and devotion then my lord has perhaps no faith in those words said d artagnan				1.0442517991329965
good said mazarin i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation why do you say that asked the queen almost timidly				4936.028453016428
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent				2435.144654888149
rochefort had returned to the chevalier d humieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll call				11326.148803006065
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene				1744.9752634706124
if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all i wish				714.3996960247594
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed				2904.097375234373
wait how long i must calculate our chances i will give you the signal but you will not leave me you will come to me or you will let me come to you				12.47029931191076
the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques				25.408822458980847
i looked carefully around i was indeed alone no noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night				308.238570160124
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercédès has declared she will kill herself if dantès is killed caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès				266.1670417757197
indeed sir i thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth will you permit me then to recall another to you relating to him yes and no faith said madame de chevreuse say on				180.76880510913932
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort				44.93935101941027
the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house				155.30050713955967
well sir replied eugénie i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eugénie				223.11411621984828
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal				11819.34535209885
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while d artagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table				99.2565337279958
just heaven what have i read cried the duke				10.990222730383598

i come in the name of our master ali tepelini if you come from ali himself said selim you know what you were charged to remit to me yes said the messenger and i bring you his ring at these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view				37118.95412028261
but who then is andrea cavalcanti asked danglars in amazement				310.50564918226206
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there i had turned up the ground				75.11822356412688

i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and sensations				4036.052481135552
all is over but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss did you not see his face asked athos				4.195835650654581

he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and d artagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after him				3.4511867315193765
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme				66.81586394130822
defend yourself one minute said the young man				1.758425475984662
then they did not watch over this man				261.80470360830066
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter				2796.7505191331416
milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition				2022.0197539374312

he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land				681.4392565483001
he hastened to the side door with ali entered hurriedly and by the servants staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant				6783.001797453603
when the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed				1148.0479322712674

if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey said athos				5.351927924823009
the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hôtel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gaëta as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended				16164.407182805824
you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body				3700.3394871879677
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle				2092.6138000968963
haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water				3350.897212864994
athos did not move				839.2748315982187
a gentleman in his opinion and according to d artagnan s portrait of him the stranger must be a gentleman would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter				220.75526114383254
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson				6636.97273007858
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule				5138.441587192841
you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time really said albert i do not know when i invited him three months ago he was then at rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone and you think him capable of being exact demanded debray				51.604936881173096

finish mouston finish the work cried porthos				293.0639471340489
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened				4431.734688049552
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantès where he was				152.94354622159486
well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society				3858.613944914313
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color				8777.881644519648
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly looking				3846.251060158404
and driving the coadjutor s carriage said the queen				9.548580254043088
i have not said good morning to you monsieur d artagnan he said nevertheless i have remarked you				116.35281489849027

how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution				880.9972432046245
however because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool				3803.8488638108884

i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher and what did he do the rest of his time monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory which as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholics all in the name of religion he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic sometimes a huguenot				5211.730258240141
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued				558.0191453188103

i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go the count rang and a footman appeared				73.83259132609015
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch				3313.323915516758
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to himself				36.77617776465011
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door				12.461082977930305
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation				82109.99024705637
it was evident he had his orders				295.12596003636656
m de tréville contented himself with asking d artagnan if he could do anything for him but d artagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted				158.19153312210594
the young man was thrown from the top of the rock the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared the count breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of anguish				818.9164494236882
athos bowed				36.56109578311876
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle d armilly s fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantio s malediction on desdemona				17295.746863768494
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d artagnan				1.0600433354062102
well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end				1311.6765574942012
you might have taken lord winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage				180.19753212890387
and then besides the useless blood				988.386502593021
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor and i i tell you against both				4871.492437120267
dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible				169.92268706512803
farewell monseigneur should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days i shall presume my letter will have miscarried				100277.77725069031
the contract shall not be signed cried morrel				22.228984324055396
that was d artagnan s road as he was going to the louvre				1347.7258518488015
contact the foundation as set forth in section below				2991.0986316780377

it is not god s will that they should be accomplished				34371.61451848622
who can tell whether dantès be innocent or guilty				1376.3600480529587
the woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon stifled				79448.44636873232
here comes m morrel back				472.1044891749492
exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello				6584.017235291957
but de winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying my god i thank thee that he knows me only chapter xli				54.350941741378975
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box				1369.6964137982982
first you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined				2656.504868793347
the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimaud s hands but grimaud shook his head				7.773332733045681
alas i have them no longer how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son well let us see said mazarin isn t there still time to repair the evil				6660.369767193003
the host drew back and burst into tears				659.1200986777956
oh it s nothing nothing cried milady				37.595207893635816
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king				971.7438262580263
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant				2791.615565436783
when one is eating ideas flow easily				3032.7303239811986
from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years				966.7984628565092
that was a noble example to follow monsieur why replied danglars not entirely so with the servants you understand i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government				1372.4442387783415
who knows				20.430357234450664
if your man is mine with one blow i shall obtain two revenges that s all but where to find this man i know not have you no information as to his abiding place none				147784.59411131882
it was indeed planchet and grimaud				84.99327339690065
athos required no more				170.94668082322423
follow my advice swear and do not insult the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the president s desk what is the form said he				29.54793868836796
he was a picard whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge tournelle making rings and plashing in the water				1109.9456890086944
they both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants				24955.733046359477
never a mistake or delay a fellow who paid like a prince				223.29047262253872
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost oh yes yes lost beyond redemption				13768.84575376871
sinbad the sailor he said				3.651511604539285
come she added				256.94289819756045
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead sea i think i can assist your researches said maximilian				695.0683335272743
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table what are the two fish asked danglars				24.480571213575086
my lord added henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire horrible cried de winter the daughter of henry iv and the wife of king charles				1983.4039772791614
however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover what relics are those by which you swear asked mazarin smiling				13.625671758365273
read he said				5.119189277656368
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an auberge recommended by a sign representing st martin giving half his cloak to a poor man				141.9493189574814
but d artagnan had now slipped through the window				53.09895455975863
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and d artagnan turned to him				8.044996492564323
write my lord he said				2.7060427621611876
that is true said d artagnan let us call the others they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis				32.3481173925998
as to aramis he never played				48316.90440315549
now said he that suffices begone which way the way you came you wish me to get out at that window you got in very well oh you have some design against me reverend sir idiot				19836.461702285455
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his feet				100.49781963649086
he will speak to me of god and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public charity and he raised the medallion to his lips				38.83857885253913
yes yes murmured d artagnan that s the place milady s own residence then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him as well as all who loved him and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court since she had discovered all				89.1833217333742
say no more i entreat you				9.707739651231797
taste some of this ham d artagnan it is exquisite said athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young man s plate				33305.089425065846
on cried d artagnan all goes well				123.63683027709152
around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings				27772.166384079497
a great favor				343.9053119504021
come with us to marseilles come along i will not what do you mean				26.293341168175214
but first interposed d artagnan you must present me to madame du vallon a third sigh from porthos				55.957549200085104
i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you				26.212303879669133
i am determined to tell them all about it be silent you simpleton cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety				2788.6380496426623
add another day for landing and that would make four				567.4443338538006
in ten minutes after the strangers had departed franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert after the manner of pliny and calpurnius touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators				4498.914974225035
d artagnan glanced at the dinner service				435.44575878950087
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening				1861.2651550686626
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison no sir not at this moment at least sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating				17760.61315865809
dantès read it				6.799888653768802
a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict				37957.91489244006
ah that is really original said beauchamp				91.05390749621425
franz returned to the manuscript and continued sir said the president you have been invited to join this assembly you were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfolded you accepted				12517.000801419334
the notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar client				34084.8835791862
here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to die like a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance				470.57639733097795
friends well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be possible				192.4689615817533
but to return to these registers true this story has diverted our attention from them				19.6776338019918
why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi				77934.43985875185
d artagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak				630.3965992774545
besides which in a short time resumed d artagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety well then i decide i have your word then yes tis given				14062.723929428023
milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole hôtel				479.07852036524446
morcerf asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen				635.0022486319268
no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not come				116.99935330095151
the queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the gascon s eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd				133.4778678750805
the papers had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galley slave and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains				41999.837496925844
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess				18811.598300373083
difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms				3397.8348783499305
it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey				1679.277383015877
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the jew s again what				148.9237129508297
pray relate it to me caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time well my good friend returned the abbé in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end				2031.1352942291699
besides i shall only take the time to go and return yes yes i understand said danglars and then in a low tone he added to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him				13.418062199067634
he kept himself upright and dreamed without sleeping				1181.902373207223
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after				1335.614034078985
do you permit me to return yes to morrow the cardinal took the queen s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips				39.47968582828833
but what ails you father				317.1109125497979
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended				4374.889208105126
that french officer yes fernand yes the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand				71.68227452055905
well monseigneur replied the latter three musketeers and a guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion st gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed i don t know how many rochellais did you inquire the names of those three musketeers yes monseigneur what are their names messieurs athos porthos and aramis still my three brave fellows murmured the cardinal				1869.7531701099483
monsieur said athos i have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their custom i have no seconds on my part monsieur said d artagnan for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de tréville to whom i was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his friends athos reflected for an instant				646.7547854763412
but now you are happy doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain and your present happiness has it softened your heart my present happiness equals my past misery said the count				6.786489521254699
and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to you my love for you				16.21933582029794
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give				5025.833031406401
false he muttered				11.147859337840824

yes the priest oh i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night before was it ever known who this miserable fellow was he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady				506.4156953769041
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousse s murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends				11126.694747107042
you have lived three years in paris				108.86668223605304
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind				110.24702205385775
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything even his father then sire may i present him this instant duke				2311.7783637227813
madame he said to the duchess i have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you it has succeeded since you deign to receive me				8.024897182104846
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him				4.031188827933045
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one				914.7586493200258
have you your sword athos cried d artagnan				1.0372556429860156
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man				305.67159035917524
m de tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the king and then for himself and his own friends				84.88703503389105
the brigadier had a moment s hope				869.8759377529608
england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained				5261.59066230055
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart				38.1249673694366
both orleans and montargis are ours				580.2005133155762
i congratulate you				8.421882578221735
what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede it is not for me to say you are wrong you must advise me what to do do you seriously ask my advice valentine certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it you know my devotion to you valentine said morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain				489.25646944446515
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife				149.43744828736806
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges that is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade but my debt and he threw the money into the river				412.70112998059903
let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea				242.11291336851755
precisely madame replied monte cristo but i perceive i have not much to teach you				8.988017793213308
but we must say at the present moment d artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested				58305.27215252693
d artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for				155.84597493085064
aramis smiled as one who hopes				4580.9328531536
on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away				377.68592264504184
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps				19867.16967063768
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening				1074.6780232536466
not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or i will hamstring your horses peste said porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each i will pay you two hundred for them said mazarin				36.80040329879756
an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones				14541.6760678189
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell				307.9453384371214
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you				15.462420846404573
how pale you are the abominable creature murmured d artagnan				1.0372362145818566
the greatest possible gayety prevailed at court				435.4561407491716
at two o clock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of monsieur de tréville				27.771713468460767
it is twenty years since i saw them and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them and these men were your friends one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me				26.270256970761938
how strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least we shall see				227.68927112336175
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him				4.530182450174711
you have decidedly some genius at your control ma foi spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf				78.14613420478253
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st				974.9518790206092
but here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp				355.97067924319094
but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base				5079.264725777563
what dost thou there rascal asked comminges				142.41481750430916
i demand the suppression of the thesis since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably				45106.24085896928
meanwhile what of mercédès				2137.131180576979

i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me it is but christian charity replied d artagnan not to lead one s neighbors into temptation it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them d artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute italian				3984.966388958124
what is this asked mercédès				610.5103193579956

it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmond s admiration of him but at the same time dantès could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there				139.43050155265047
no boat exclaimed groslow it is impossible tis true however answered the sailor there s nothing in the wake of the ship besides here s the end of the cable what s the matter cried mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his torch				33026.59409351267
i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself				251.76011639666558
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none				9883.21497016161

noirtier rue coq héron no				37.68935159630934
but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you now that i see you young and with a promising future now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth edmond turned away his head with a sigh				397.49099181164013
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air à l anglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures				963.0352425773186
these two men were the executioner s assistants				70692.83820214508
at last cried d artagnan				1.0335227250384011
aramis here cried athos				2.599056096413467
ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag				7866.686528666185
yield you yield to me do you not a giant had seized also aramis s two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp				416.6059170054254

this is what i shall do i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned				10880.021063819688
drive to the palace said comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive				34738.06024158955
besides i am a picard then it is understood said d artagnan you would rather be killed than desert your post yes monsieur and there is nothing i would not do to prove to monsieur that i am attached to him good said d artagnan to himself				34.9644648704102
doubt if you please but i am sure of what i say				56.06526382107559
ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere yes sire replied athos				4.047616348370966
mercédès raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her				14.69571257895243
oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them				24.709237514782398
if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years old				335.55804261211364
begone then d artagnan saluted m de tréville who held out his hand to him d artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude				2476.87404588478
yes what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer				241.59452840682115
five answered groslow one every two hours d artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive				28567.065166082917
do as you like she said i rely upon you will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business command sir what do the people want this time demanded the king				18.661385668347076
these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo				7224.511026979543
i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money today and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to danglars				233.85592914790968
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you				337.4464534490555
in the first place you will sup with me will you not asked aramis				17.274896351727218
haydée s nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers nay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence				677.6871953701209

you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here				134.85640793952592
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words				559.7527106715883
he kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road				481.6629825858719
that falls out oddly				7661.82868668968
you mean to say we have lost said athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table				85.16845337351089
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead				647.1172531481202
one night more and he would be on his way				297.0311946659694

no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued				41687.38142348354
many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him many others said he would not appear while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels and others went to the police office to inquire if he had taken out a passport				13824.264733938586
but as we have said d artagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty				19320.007276077416
why did we not destroy the child with the mother what need you fear said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves				3549.237489211345
it appears that the method i have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best				4052.6259113937754
and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman				63950.13007030073
why did you talk of a regiment athos				899.9159831042579
he thought a moment cut a branch of a resinous tree lighted it at the fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch				5739.851170458083
they quitted paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by faction				30264.910619722028
king judges spectators all turned their eyes to the bench where the four friends were seated				1645.037619276892
ah said caderousse no				77.33730808587788

perhaps he would have sought to escape by flight had he seen any possibility of doing so				55.024217106595664

i hoped to be able to rely upon that and i madame said d artagnan embarrassed you promised me take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way d artagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme				51.887632512799776
besides we must try our own arms bah let us enjoy that pleasure said aramis with his mild and careless manner				203.94495171902255

we have undergone a great deal of fatigue remember and a little rest will do no harm i rest				862.0371132790632
i bought said he the business of my predecessor on the strength of his assurance that he supplied the castle whereas on my honor monsieur de chavigny though i ve been here a week has not ordered so much as a tartlet but i then replied probably monsieur de chavigny is afraid your pastry is not good my pastry not good				138.49732102575894
and does he not live in the champs élysées yes no				33.189213288442794
you will assist me in the work will you not most undoubtedly				36909.55777638341
yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain				3925.8313022448183
does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat				349.4013281892139
and now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy haydée s apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son haydée said morrel what has become of her she departed last night to leave you to wait for me				20.541522004965117
beware of a profane taste in your theological style				2988.997052804392
the evidence will support it				10.417847102233917
but he said mouston is not so young as he was my dear fellow besides he has grown fat and perhaps has lost his fitness for active service that may be true replied porthos but i am used to him and besides he wouldn t be willing to let me go without him he loves me so much oh blind self love thought d artagnan				554.3465493010337
perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends i hope yes my lord but with the hope of soon becoming enemies be satisfied i promise you that i depend upon your word my lord d artagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside				44910.2537940677
you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign where is the treaty here it is anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that d artagnan presented to her				33.57922031190078
i practiced this exercise and as nature has endowed me with some faculties at this day i can throw the lasso with any man in the world				69.3681979854182

the you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand				62.13282102764303
it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count				29.610626119435654
i suppose that is not all to take my orders from the coadjutor and to see if we can not wake up mazarin a little a bad plan you ll be shut up again in the bastile oh as to that i shall take care i assure you				11.457323704683333
can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos				5.133872279208435
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy father abandon thee valentine it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin and this time as though nature had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own strength the words of morrel were stifled in his throat his breast heaved the tears so long rebellious gushed from his eyes and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the side of the bed				196.60677228501788
i think i have killed the insolent fellow				434.2215955745823
planchet said d artagnan cocking his pistols i will take charge of the one at the top you look to the one below				7575.317669766355

the truth was that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed teresa toward another part of the garden				172.65027305224962
bread and salt madame de morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion				321.8855822976165
i am glad to see said d artagnan that you have still that honest lad with you he is my steward replied porthos he will never leave me				5.049086734109763
with this light was extinguished the last irresolution in the heart of d artagnan				1.0802309541499497
this was the last blow to the prisoner				143.29832227922012
did the sun shine in my eyes and she leaned against the window				44.30503627463092
villefort traversed the antechamber cast a side glance at dantès and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the prisoner rapid as had been villefort s glance it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate				1293.6588460386736
well am i to rush into his arms and strain him to my heart crying my father my father like monsieur pixérécourt do not let us jest gravely replied bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it bah said andrea a little overcome by the solemnity of bertuccio s manner why not because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you oh these are fine words and there will be fine doings if you do not take care menaces i do not fear them				23.225865105511353
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood				392.0030449711915

peste if he is giving away hats like that porthos let us look out and both demand a regiment to morrow				1708.7716921456126
on his right hand and his left were two footmen with the seams of their dresses laced				51495.06499465945
adieu valentine adieu said morrel bowing				195.13900645177017
but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him				19.045743230094214
the former dantès proposed to augment the latter to remedy				101136.86761354738
he sends me for that purpose and here i am the poor woman s head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees				296.87713519665164

take this pen and write caderousse awed by the superior power of the abbé sat down and wrote sir the man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon				12045.405725600469
i was at the end of my journey and of my credit				6334.336240258999
grief had made her blind to all but one object that was edmond				2670.657498311979
it was scarcely eleven o clock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which d artagnan had left him a little cavalier				2752.461531445318
well be on our side now resumed aramis				20.194151408659934
franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained				49495.076879623266
cardinal mazarin as king				62.243250879669326
what is the matter dear grandfather said i are you pleased he gave me a sign in the affirmative				1334.7328962269335
then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss				2095.8762708893246
well albert said franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels				39446.128817572935
nevertheless d artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him				26.519281854849833
he passed on to another it also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full				9658.119847630589
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening				3058.916244485335
duc d harcourt fontrailles and the others escaped de rieux was inclined to do likewise but i told him they wouldn t look for us where we were				395.5888007891576
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened				2527.1596042078677
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with d artagnan on one side porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan				365.87431302974704
do not be alarmed maximilian it is nothing and has already passed away				142.06951372589054
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition				2884.951078888522
dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying				1211.0212879340697
she asked me not to send the protestants of la rochelle the assistance i promised them i have not done so				17.506223696760962
her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts				835.93743517157
you guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country priest				6627.308281436288
he repaired then instantly to the office of the lieutenant criminel				20326.01259891905
nothing but intrigues				523.2624729746811
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success				24433.40078547054
i can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river				798.8869391645381
the valet re entered				56.84430872965768
your name the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times possibly madame				392.3037301939788
the steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each other s torches				15613.711818453206
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping				3707.701066812508
yes in italy it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle yes madame and i were there two years ago				3056.5425571157434
in short groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception				74726.92621175
well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and i may believe it in every particular see sir replied caderousse in this corner is a crucifix in holy wood here on this shelf is my wife s testament open this book and i will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix				22677.1438156463

these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will i trust do me the honor to breakfast with me but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure				1141.3739567695372
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it you know his business here then pardieu he has come to draw but i don t know how much you will know presently my friend very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day what do you mean of whom do you speak				385.31567704239995
quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal				59.85638037252283
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements				2211.4530084728303
the young man pressed valentine s hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase				1021.1967346734486
my dear athos i have reflected on your arguments and i am convinced				391.8279385365295
monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison				644.3737306575512
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience				2164.845457509961
sinbad the sailor humph said the major very good				362.0580996177963
it can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts				1575.5301944470968
madame cried mazarin you have ruined us all the king yourself and me at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges				483.79977958183366
well everything was finished as you know				71.00590363522502
m de monte cristo has only shown us kindness				1663.3005980626797
soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them then at last the volcano was extinguished then all was dark and still the floating bark and heaving ocean				984.2111505416935
in spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in love				307.3204358794317
you who love and are beloved you who have faith and hope oh do not follow my example				794.9042781606231
the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum				73201.80939031404
you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and i think you relished them tolerably while speaking caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions				3317.611419265128
you ll bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur groslow by this arrangement d artagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis				469.2340052933427
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister				308.9447329416252
while monsieur d arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry				12628.401598889039
it was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole body				287.0709738246561
the count s tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune				4150.884080610939
in the rue meslay				199.01937762359728
what is it listen said the guide i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years so i began to sound the wall ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbé s two hiding places				152806.66121211438
second porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh as the englishman without making any further resistance then surrendered his sword porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his carriage				119.42785432602578
did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so monsieur de beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun				461.215041995545
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of us i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter				8.223207145259046
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry i am very much in a hurry aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of him				7.926092384089871
no this is his blood where were you then where you left me under the scaffold did you see it all no but i heard all				52.438346060532844

you are free to night without fighting so much the better				123.77480209509274
it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him nevertheless believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father however much i might be proud of such a son				413.0720512511624
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground				47.11978991871748
come monsieur bazin make yourself easy said d artagnan people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven monsieur was already such a good theologian said bazin almost weeping he might have become a bishop and perhaps a cardinal well but my poor bazin reflect a little				373.85933738192784

ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore you d artagnan felt himself bewildered				5079.976838446314
hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you desire that is to say replied d artagnan that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it				6.7336991169122316
will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hôtel of the duc de la trémouille and that they did not endeavor to burn it which would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example				3050.241118219993
felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would see				344.09230775880206
no it will all go well m d épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m d épinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation				55245.87678902797
you owe me nothing but some trifle of francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself				47.142488535555614
lord de winter perceived nothing of this				175.05915397380386
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength				2211.621735384059

they proceeded to the rue saint denis				199.086293253777
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris				87.96442977258475
charming said mazarin				68.8936473307285
she will be the sooner with her mother				309.60703947646914
dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone				185.70054419577755
three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities				14686.733167029277
thence introduced into a half subterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment				24763.29713672513
they are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite wine				363.91252704526454

monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt				39840.37436628304
this morning you rose at five o clock you must stand in need of repose				267.7458740665923
danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage				903.8880144098914
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity but if he had escaped impossible my precautions were taken and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done it is possible				162.39763037005224
night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dantès agitation				542.566631894928

i will be an abbé if it suits me				17.710807947240045
there is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth oh go on monsieur go on said madame de chevreuse eagerly you can t imagine how much this conversation interests me you encourage me said athos i will continue then				206.7019389795932
it concerns me much said d artagnan since you can not marry madame without my consent and since and since asked the swiss				500.63177821609446
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd				199.98694825885917
d artagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in flanders spain yonder woman here				460.1088310973151
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family				968.8770625992937
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force				6991.713131336047
bravo bravo morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained				12951.778823455055
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs				99138.52709165461
four hours later he was in neufchâtel				780.5850607736033

this man has often made me shudder and one day when we were viewing an execution i thought i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the sight of the executioner and the culprit did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your blood asked beauchamp				40.952850503286626
come d artagnan don t let us play a sidelong game your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble voice ah				56.67188176836626

i never knew till now the delight of speed said morcerf and the last cloud disappeared from his brow but where the devil do you get such horses				799.4413976961198
this unexpected circumstance brought back richelieu s former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the sea				114.48498814700113
in fact ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the king s closet opened and m de tréville saw m de la trémouille come out				30.407891910722764
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m de villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden				353.1610855644027
behind the executioner came in the order in which they were to die first peppino and then andrea				3270.322025513754
she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon d artagnan when he spared the life of her brother				269.5699695316019
i had about a million in their hands but warned in time i withdrew it a month ago ah mon dieu exclaimed danglars they have drawn on me for francs well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per cent yes but it is too late said danglars i have honored their bills then said monte cristo here are francs gone after hush do not mention these things said danglars then approaching monte cristo he added especially before young m cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question				268.7071722415363

i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the king s attorney and this king s attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly				100.6235473270648
now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to him				7.930222514770727
andrea cavalcanti the count of monte cristo entered the adjoining room which baptistin had designated as the drawing room and found there a young man of graceful demeanor and elegant appearance who had arrived in a cab about half an hour previously				7052.849377690929

in fact it seems to me so great an honor for a prisoner that i think monsieur de comminges must be mistaken what				308.8654869221512
scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cæsar s podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a half dilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin				8627.489644445008

he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly				6033.271901118572
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile				122.74021367590102

instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters i am free to do so				18.18941886591499
the citizen followed him				6.050367671812122

monsieur d artagnan murmured raoul				81.15983474730447

toward eleven o clock the king entered the hall surrounded by guards but wearing his head covered and with a calm expression turned to every side with a look of complete assurance as if he were there to preside at an assembly of submissive subjects rather than to meet the accusations of a rebel court				1292.1841470733737
danglars instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well				110.57206670233838
the white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead and her eyes already sunken by the furrows of age now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief				629.3820015769558
yes and important				582.5227388224193
mercédès and albert were in that room				534.6403492405461
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph				5170.787600001557

hear the end				97.50336724948065
no cardinal said d artagnan but only his lantern where the devil then is he exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture				35124.62177300714
mademoiselle de villefort is the culprit she is the poisoner				88312.21639373356
the carriage stopped at the door of the palace				461.3043399739247
thanks to the spurs which served as stirrups in a moment we were perched upon the croupe we were well placed and saw everything				222.77499297459158
i have something better than that said monte cristo i have a slave				775.1733349088036
the petition finished villefort read it aloud				226.7387698269951
as to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin				70083.59341846626
she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance				48956.898339474086
m villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m de villefort				5.845708084693969

athos began to despair				518.2121982910478
now said the baron look at this woman				295.110339750078
pardieu said athos it was hardly worth while to distribute ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes mattocks and shovels				15158.952918868108
all i ask is that villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles				7701.240771443696
and i too added aramis				15.841741824995353

andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long				443.66547285054776
yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four hundred but four hundred what listen cried d artagnan				1.0304979081243792

we are about to have the honor of charging you replied aramis lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other				45.4454228348984
noirtier closed his eyes				36.09025390113918

at last they lost sight of each other				55.104116050257865
albert threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the papers looked at the theatre announcements made a face seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth powder of which he had heard and threw down one after the other the three leading papers of paris muttering these papers become more and more stupid every day a moment after a carriage stopped before the door and the servant announced m lucien debray				2395.9661330320846
but where is my old friend winter the two gentlemen turned away their heads in silence				216.3273798524487
the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose				605.9369582609278
have a care cried porthos to his opponent i ve still two pistols charged the more reason you should fire the first cried his foe				8753.129366615998
your eminence might knock against something or fall into a hole monsieur d artagnan muttered mazarin unable to recover from his astonishment				6473.342346043652
what art thou then				77.9741315420948
i have already had the honor of telling you i was said morrel				33.393661547310806
time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses				18468.414971127924
the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the half closed teeth the white lips no longer quivered the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax				71569.81242742126
i don t very well know				128.07405876745455
his house has been full ever since				623.6065840648954
oh d artagnan the devil				92.18667818273602
my friends said athos this is what i expected from such hearts as yours				259.3106569496488
oh continued milady do your wounds still make you suffer yes much said d artagnan who did not well know how to answer				580.0688375456181
confided to me it shall never escape my lips say albert my friend do you wish it albert threw himself on beauchamp s neck				1238.2356652731517
presently presently cried the latter when you haven t your cloak on at one o clock then behind the luxembourg very well at one o clock then replied d artagnan turning the angle of the street				301.63524881837293
his soldiers formed a legion of devil may care fellows perfectly undisciplined toward all but himself				538.7775763603775
the blood mounted instantly to the temples of d artagnan who arose and replied i consider it worthy conduct of a pupil of jesuits on seeing d artagnan rise porthos rose also these four men were therefore all standing at the same time with a menacing aspect opposite to each other				93.78779201857276
the first named malefactor will be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato				99668.92501008924
bravo count bravo it is frank at least said morrel				29.0286361131073
you have understood me then dear monsieur d artagnan said milady				41.698073209182304
i do not say i regret no i will never pronounce that sentence which would not be orthodox the jesuit raised his hands toward heaven and the curate did the same				355.19411810758965
there is nothing so expressive as the face of an epicure who finds himself before a well spread table so la ramee when receiving his plate of soup from grimaud presented a type of perfect bliss				4751.298233479099
no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence renée uttered a smothered exclamation				4806.860347595691
athos repeated m de tréville himself				319.01368244121477
yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman				461.0164929482686
the palace of the louvre contains two things the king who must die and royalty which never dies				6602.912717062687
why for him and not for me				5.732807236669739

chapter lxii				92.32819969518142
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues				12845.669426677414
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey and do you command nothing in your own name in my name said mme				22.837809911744348
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with château renaud and beauchamp				188.00477500124524
the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the island of corsica				987.5587763118633
if those who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault we will allow the besiegers to get as far as the ditch and then we will push down upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a miracle bravo cried porthos				15.11694798908596
and you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you the old man nodded				10587.833343143227
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them				212.15718979926865
you know dear d artagnan i am nothing more than a good honest country gentleman				2588.482599548706
thinking that i might wish to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the papers establishing my identity a letter promising if he approved of my choice livres per annum from the day i was married				16698.082372512752
faithful to his mission of vengeance athos had requested to be conducted to the garden and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest				167.03600066524214
the lackeys were sent on before with the baggage and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth				120058.79799710898
bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive				124340.81161365281
every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent pistache				22484.666676108438

a million in gold remains it is buried in the cellars of newcastle keep				19671.640848135165
sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet he also was dying of hunger				1241.0883942673063
i am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak i speak of the adventure eh you know well what i mean alas no my lord replied d artagnan surprised				129.54260940529176

in france chapter lxi				21.983694881669802
everyone therefore ran to the court some to witness the sight others to comment upon it				6.029630281336651
the two men smiled at each other shook hands and saluted his eminence				367.480965975582
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre				118529.21317832689
the king s musketeers are arrested by the guards of the cardinal are they continued m de tréville as furious at heart as his soldiers but emphasizing his words and plunging them one by one so to say like so many blows of a stiletto into the bosoms of his auditors				5298.0809288202545
she has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may obtain his pardon				1594.3034922234076
from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the fête exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight				1006.5219930769082
see it is on fire yet with his hot blood for it is not thirty hours since it was drawn from the wound and grimaud threw the dagger on the table				67.84806391799272
it was something terrible to witness the silent agony the mute despair of noirtier whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks				402.4204987009235
they both advanced beneath the trees through whose branches streamed the moonlight				35440.30500742598
at that time it was believed that the separation of the musketeers and the guards would be but momentary the king holding his parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after				1099.9985664723006
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken				180.63447348096577
hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort cried the prisoner laughing violently and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee the king s commissioner la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window				60.68816194403954
he accepted therefore with delight an offer made to him by his friend the steward of the duc de grammont to give him a substitute he also spoke of it to monsieur de chavigny who promised that he would not oppose it in any way that is if he approved of the person proposed				22311.945000700158
monsieur said d artagnan you must excuse famished travelers				61562.2059231694
for the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance in order to watch the shore of the mediterranean				10591.923557604634
beware monsieur there is certainly some magic underneath meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter				144.1145848450212
well said morcerf i may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your wishes				1295.4143990888738
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence				2267.0688466535917

your pardon my officer said athos but we were ignorant with whom we had to do and you may see that we were keeping good guard your name said the officer who covered a part of his face with his cloak				411.5713264698075
the money is nothing that letter was everything				1515.3170855532665
come come give it to me				8.0897811813432
eh he said negligently this money is not mine				1101.2019490309344
gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man which the traveller did not understand but which evidently concerned him				4.082808585947934
two lackeys dragged milady whom each held by one arm				289.66000759561075
the next morning she found her grandmother in bed the fever had not abated on the contrary her eyes glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability				18976.631735442897

they passed to the third story it was the telegraph room				137.50985183789052
then he bowed a second time and retired				341.2046138516022
her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels				1248.0567652075533
will you not come with me he said i shall pass by blois raoul turned toward athos who showed him by a secret sign that he did not wish him to go				507.2642341097042
it is on her account i am here i wish to see valentine villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that valentine was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her step mother and that she should be fetched				384771.1475516549
he resolved therefore to let things take their course without making any direct overture to the count				56.43756242607096
how did you penetrate hither				23367.64799618859
felton barred his passage				175.76057435763875

see my father see villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man who almost a stranger to him called noirtier his father				48.61683080348733
bravo bravo said franz things go wonderfully				21530.797021038474
if so i will give you a letter of introduction to him oh father i exclaimed you are very good but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have reason to repent my recommendation i extended my hand and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would dictate but he stopped me				7.364699590669202
yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to effect				4949.217244792577
my friends retire they all bowed and retired by degrees as noiselessly as they had entered				1357.313364963857
alas alas murmured he if the procureur himself had been at marseilles i should have been ruined				1252.1579132311495
capital answered the mendicant				7288.600349442781
no indeed cried d artagnan				1.0431412451933761
bills upon his majesty s private treasury answered d artagnan who reckoning upon entering into the king s service in consequence of this recommendation believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply without telling of a falsehood				1786.9303654687758
he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable oh with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started alarmed and blaisois was near fainting from fright				4447.230455371975
gentlemen said he although a companion is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable				2161.694141787864
but so it is a woman will often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe				2385.8013536804856
it was however too late albert had followed the footman and hearing the order given forced the door open and followed by beauchamp found himself in the banker s study				791.0127563825197
at his announcement d artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his bones				2532.8852174381395
porthos seized his opportunity caught the next soldier by his neck gagged him and pushed him like a mummy through the bars into the room and entered after him				4.9169682772641705
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour				519.6421749039334
the last two mounted guard at the door during this examination then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and exposed and porthos and aramis i could not find them they did not come but they may come any moment for you left word that i awaited them yes monsieur well don t budge then if they come tell them what has happened				805.5931714788968
pray reflect a little				87.58109587170847
it is the work of another age constructed by the genii of earth and water how so at what period can that have been i do not know i have only heard that an emperor of china had an oven built expressly and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively baked				29877.730965293722
while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting with the appetites of convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in misfortune d artagnan related how aramis being wounded was obliged to stop at crèvecœur how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four men who accused him of being a coiner and how he d artagnan had been forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach england				588.0205600151914
on reaching the courtyard they heard the noise of a carriage which stopped at the gate				346.57780467896987
yes sir replied mousqueton				67.44244880281168
each one stretching out his hand to the bag took his seventy five pistoles and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed				1058.8918524758753
the bandits shouted with laughter				2343.3402713062596
alas my dear mother some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of happiness which heaven had made them on the fragments of all the hope which god had given them				19.32614191978067
look at my eyes and you will see what no looking glass has ever shown you a frank and honorable countenance to this flow of words not perhaps in the best taste but characteristic of d artagnan whose principal object was to divert his opponent s attention mordaunt did not reply but continuing to turn around he succeeded in changing places with d artagnan				1.0504909758955137
and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant general the count of morcerf peer of france oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretch to reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me				14.651034484899636
know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this world s affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east				3256.54099937642
what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion				688.0195761670806
he replied in monosyllables and athos and aramis looked significantly at one another				490.087941032546
so call me mercédès if you please we must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dantès he is so easily mistaken so then the wedding is to take place immediately m dantès said danglars bowing to the young couple				28185.742411607887
what do you say to that i might answer sire that he is too deeply interested in the question to be a very impartial witness but so far from that sire i know the duke to be a royal gentleman and i refer the matter to him but upon one condition sire what it is that your majesty will make him come here will interrogate him yourself tête à tête without witnesses and that i shall see your majesty as soon as you have seen the duke what then				63.09093045720134

bonacieux but why then did you cry out so do you not understand said milady who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind				644.9897766742617

then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of forges they stopped on the road but you continued yours				628.3381757283777
most probably morrel and château renaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces but it was not the case with debray				565.1062245148647

and like every other reflection passing in a mind that entertained none but noble thoughts this feeling was expressed in his eyes				84.06173391294843
franz could not we will not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern head upon manfred s shoulders or beneath lara s helmet				242166.04870278318
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris				188.28612037535459

the servant who had travelled at the back of the carriage waited on him baptistin who rode in front attended the count				25.818320264290907
well inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to drew a smile to franz s countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him				7.3984977282851245
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you i am at your command my lord returned d artagnan				1.045668841103477

for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled dantès to learn it by heart and dantès knew it from the first to the last word				347.0347222354103

i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses				7805.407937648993
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle				1461.4330791413388
hallo fernand				26.540110646770113
for the first time in his life danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire the time had come when the implacable spectre which exists in the mind of every human creature arrested his attention and called out with every pulsation of his heart thou shalt die danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase first it flies then despairs and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers				151048.1597828704
in addition to this everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection				5945.702480877672
remember it is you who have ruined me yes yes to be sure kitty said d artagnan be at ease my girl				484.90028489127445

now i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you from the bottom of my heart the count bowed again but lower than before he was even paler than mercédès				761.9950616723162
then there was the ring with the lion s head which cæsar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand				132.71286508525495
you are pale it is this answered athos with a trembling voice				21.207262640820794
i am in the power of men upon whom i can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or granite they know me by heart and are steeled against all my weapons				10261.698283767648

madame de villefort at this really did turn pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the name of edward but the count on the contrary smiled and appeared to look at the boy complacently which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm				1442.132352385487

a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers				537.6909202509244
you must yourself have remarked how much you have been considered in all the circumstances d artagnan bowed with respect				1891.282721950827
that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it and that is why on account of the living mercédès and my deceased father i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand and i have revenged myself and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that i am satisfied madame that he did what i have told you besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards that a stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and murdered ali				21208.59955552563
this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall				1619.6626464434814

oh yes and with all my heart for i know what it is to be in love you know what it is to be in love said d artagnan looking at her for the first time with much attention				1465.0682625110044
monsieur bertuccio chapter				2.6439384808760495
in the avenue des champs élysées				28.582288884914153
and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king on the contrary i am certain he will do so				10.709379818822137
let us see said the queen what the count says and she opened the letter and read madame being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand i have commanded my son the count de guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens and that this victory can not fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe				1821.6696592807098
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time				160.5155905337172
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely				370138.0901372527
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than once i can not believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this relates i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it and will your grace sign that order without remorse buckingham looked at the young man haughtily				4119.15121270336
exactly like me				6.1940938865078286
come come my little fellow don t be angry				2772.6885585330233
is he a deputy oh no				34.35680635161692
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day				1165.2777174635205
au revoir not farewell				2351.798511401425
i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged				882.4561698697602
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene				888.5156058992258
she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again				215.89261509918407
this tranquillity proved one thing that d artagnan did not yet know milady				276.1973605167265
at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast				1389.8536535298886
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark				10349.473161015098
bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life				310.1505069197857
for two days no one knew what had become of her and everything remained in suspense but once free and placed in communication with laporte matters resumed their course and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which but for her arrest would have been executed three days earlier				4838.604713043179
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud				358.2541863071562
you who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledge and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl				111.08733103108938
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle				1826.9621369550653
he promised to be here and i have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad but if he does not come said d artagnan				1.0345783225760854
have you monsieur le gascon asked mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands				45.856247801455225
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer				21990.868288126378
but there are some with which on the contrary i am not acquainted				5221.267025351988
the queen entered and d artagnan remained at the door				10.02257061396235
you know it is not my fault said morrel				33.94995612961395
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct				14322.332477438606
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box yes what do you think of her oh she is perfectly lovely what a complexion				6014.056184626549
maximilian smiled				8.017635727844606
bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st denis or in the fair of st germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom d artagnan had often remarked this				278.0481404393762
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties				2444.7023531164473
and now now escort me where where i am going but where are you going you will see because you will leave me at the door shall i wait for you that will be useless you will return alone then perhaps yes perhaps no but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman i don t know yet but i will know it how so i will wait until you come out in that case adieu why so i do not want you but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy the word is rather hard how are they called who follow others in spite of them they are indiscreet the word is too mild well madame i perceive i must do as you wish why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once is there no merit in repentance and do you really repent i know nothing about it myself				349.77539559550485
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me but i can not leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped				636.7122977171638
what would you do i should give up broussel said porthos				12.186212330164798
d artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance				117.67624690184061
m de tréville had intimated to them his majesty s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of may and they must immediately prepare their outfits				46654.22633401473
monsieur de beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot				1792.6330093962608
the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place				125.89998760004829
i received this morning five millions which i paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure				1584.8198987885016
what cried porthos are we all going away then				126.10456869996342
well sir he said				3.1663863661453853
how are you sir asked morrel with a sickness of heart				973.0755180676683
and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked cavalcanti				373.3119147709222
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation				97550.43910873942
did you know that i am at liberty i knew it from the fountain head from planchet				315.09566204029943
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable				24950.021785989473
valentine said he dear valentine you must not speak thus rather let me die				157.60613824311756
m noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain				15788.965265419083
i am hardly nineteen i know nothing i have no part to play				18983.29279390858
ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise d armilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine				1077.6759088480374
at a league from beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud				21046.844447901232
they believe me her accomplice and will punish me with her				43.7016227304823
it consisted as we have said of a small dressing room opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone				248.34707194119918
what is it cried many persons present				1838.35486955789
read this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe				40100.34301452793
that is my failing a capital failing i admit but with that exception i am a good drinker athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d artagnan was shaken in his conviction				5592.026287772148
tis not for me a private individual to disunite a queen from her kingdom				2719.808118802223
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand				94.89251836010254
does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him there will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs				158625.64827844978
here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm				220.1493507036608
there is but one favor i would entreat of you speak guard carefully the secret of your birth				10510.899817384328
i not only permit i desire let them come in the marshal introduced the two young men and placed them face to face with the prince				198.2437581917237
and very princely added château renaud				7.935353676783179
charles stuart said the colonel of the english regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner colonel tomlison said charles kings can not yield the man alone submits to force your sword the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee				751.2743205462288
stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear d artagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it i pray d artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure				2050.8897750742717
he felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress				482.96262515136044
summon bertuccio said the count				6.948460978413895
i will lay a wager that twas that saint christopher porthos who performed this feat				21347.316832136872
and so my friends we return to paris				312.7443625163269
d artagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous				34710.24319648826
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me				4.483773699255872
he has returned said he				11.158285666999888
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs				115.67217104481611
and what has happened to you my dear porthos continued d artagnan				1.0498976710181398
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber				53.31235767811389
in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the cross roads				75550.69781329378
charles shuddered				6.562930997926839
it is six o clock said madame de villefort evidently agitated				7786.115114967767
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property				69769.63054295872
the third then fell from the clouds i suppose no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master or his mistress interrupted d artagnan				1.0486588459502688
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph				170813.96290197776
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god				196.55390472451276
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself				39.743668003944265
you are going sir yes said cromwell				153.9187881557594
a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner				313.94221086979513
the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass				1972.8594473408239
in another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept				17741.754423684743
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger				1321.943992819613
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarin s niece				20115.049727050275
the young man s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie				509.0184893114577
the count s tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere				60.048173567846135
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned				3843.640280193975
oh my god my god				29.83826914197458
why he is surrounded by sultanas like a turk				16358.957095416694
we need not say she stopped at the first floor				259.69511898455926
and now you will do me a favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me just then the count felt his arm pressed				176275.68146001053
no doubt m danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs				1440.1395099332528
you are right and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos				4.937762359041184
his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbé was not in paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abbé was known to be a great traveller				6755.243022150773
it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation				38393.41249754473
yes especially if you will show me the poor abbé s room ah				42.53459785636389
all the same resumed he after having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows				68098.06455109228
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken				632.0815865095659
to eat do you hear are you hungry come you understand me what would your excellency like to eat a piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place bread				6808.835403144763
there was no fear of her falling asleep				665.6277061895229
it was at this period i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by napoleon had bestowed on him a son named king of rome even in his cradle				23240.036523220002
listen to the voice of your heart morrel and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me my friend said maximilian the voice of my heart is very sorrowful and promises me nothing but misfortune it is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud				13070.950224789784
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows they ascended five or six more steps and then dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro				150502.90584102168
you are in a shocking hurry to be off you forget one of my guests				9701.942163518652
doctor doctor cried barrois who felt another fit coming				4069.1975448955595
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos				8.614693777790071
high walls not more than eight or ten feet that is not prudent said caderousse				30.895893941530673
has anyone been speaking to you against me yes said the old man s look with eagerness				1107258.279270302
at any rate tell me there s more chance of fighting in paris is there not in that respect my dear friend it s delightful				18588.004287905642
m d épinay became very pale he looked round him a second time several members of the club were whispering and getting their arms from under their cloaks				4898.181165853812
mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement				25719.493912313283
in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa				16567.694453476415
how did your father receive him albert				410.2401444072038
strength and sagacity				113.07061802545502
listen now to what i say in this my dying moment				429.54806751192666
then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel				378.2478755097998
what undertaking can have brought him to paris				302.13043311597227
a carriage had been sent to meet him and the gigantic porthos who stood a head above the entire rabble soon announced that he saw the royal equipage approaching				1580.1640757873072
this evening with you to morrow at stuart s the next day with me you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said d artagnan				1.0358473048648429
sir said madame de saint méran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child yes madame replied villefort it is not only projected but arranged your intended son in law is named m franz d épinay yes madame is he not the son of general d épinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of elba the same does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished mother said villefort m				83.77686142568098
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared				119.1259016744682
the best				148.9383422154979
then is it not resumed the duke the superintendent emery who gave his son when he was married three hundred thousand francs and a house compared to which the tuileries are a heap of ruins and the louvre a paltry building the dog again shook his head as if to say no then said the prisoner let s think who it can be				122.68006256646181
yes my poor girl replied morrel i come to bring and to hear bad tidings this is indeed a house of mourning said valentine speak maximilian although the cup of sorrow seems already full dear valentine said morrel endeavoring to conceal his own emotion listen i entreat you what i am about to say is very serious				32655.179977449334
it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered				636.3674923320193
now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever				1149.1411265211887
so many times in order to follow valentine in thought at every hour in the day had he made her describe the whole house that without having seen it he knew it all				81.53737751114724
whom does this belong to he inquired				6572.210740386732
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourself whom he considered the first three personages in france d artagnan added m de tréville to the others as may be perceived but he thought this addition would do no harm				65313.50553809188
live the guards m de busigny was the first to come and shake athos by the hand and acknowledge that the wager was lost				468.90453989926124
about this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of				116.30078503296369
further this woman as if not certain of the house she was seeking lifted up her eyes to look around her stopped went backward and then returned again				111.1810754968777
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings				776381.1960102968
this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible upon my word said dantès you make me shudder				5182.507643378952
what does scandal signify to me				7.175750938120689
are you not the beloved of one of my best friends dear d artagnan				1.0536618241240367
such news was decisive it destroyed in favor of the court the struggle commenced with parliament				3523.615964092059
the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking				896.7200565921428
how did you get this passport when i went to ask m de monte cristo for letters to the directors of the theatres at rome and naples i expressed my fears of travelling as a woman he perfectly understood them and undertook to procure for me a man s passport and two days after i received this to which i have added with my own hand travelling with his sister well said eugénie cheerfully we have then only to pack up our trunks we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract instead of the evening of the wedding that is all but consider the matter seriously eugénie oh i am done with considering				852235.9189029635
there are the prince de conti the duc de longueville the duc de beaufort the duc de bouillon the marechal de la mothe the marquis de sevigne and i don t know who for my part and the vicomte raoul de bragelonne inquired athos in a tremulous voice				49.32093174122336
this evening m coquenard is going to the house of the duc de chaulnes who has sent for him				4.406724925669781
la ramee adored his wife and children whom now he could only catch a glimpse of from the top of the wall when in order to please him they used to walk on the opposite side of the moat				11316.064733732552
it seems to me that in the most critical positions of our lives we have always dined oh				487.44130526262717
you know i always did call you my child come come what then patience patience i am patient but go on all at once i see you pass through the barrier with a groom a tilbury and fine new clothes				981.1625610469036
yes your french husband				276.2861413673908
let us pursue him and we shall overtake him my dear friend said aramis remember that he goes in an opposite direction from that in which we are going that he has a fresh horse and ours are fatigued so that we shall disable our own horses without even a chance of overtaking him				5.540844235577096
ah i can understand how the sight of him struck you replied lord de winter				7.447600450930452

immediately said albert				44.793476341662334
he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still insensible				1486.714826139343
in his time they armed gentlemen not disarmed them				32.079582131264566
we are not living in the time of cardinal richelieu who would have closed the ports on bare suspicion it matters not you were wrong to reply to him as you did continued aramis following with his eyes the young man now vanishing behind the cliffs				115501.15716480734
yes my lord said the young man with such peculiar emphasis that the cardinal felt a shudder run through every vein				136162.9473396142
our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year from which we derive an income of francs				149.29913060825882
it was time for athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his knee				1085.868267911868
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it d artagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you				9.904009379004387

wretched wretched that i am hallo catalan				101764.48874007916
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand				15.57164588145902
in the space of five minutes the monk turned around to ascertain whether he was followed or not				7887.231983981097
but pardon me are you free				684.1399345683537
listen morrel it is noon if valentine is not now dead she will not die how so cried morrel when i left her dying monte cristo pressed his hands to his forehead				346.917086572536
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready				984.5434770166158
go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible madame faltered d artagnan tis twenty years ago i have a good memory since i had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville of kissing one of those lovely hands there is the other replied the queen and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him take and keep this ring in remembrance of me				230.34508018902284
arrived at the staircase it was still worse				846.6773220570818
d artagnan meantime pursued his way with the indifference of a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression				1777.2303546512837
speak madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart				4883.2326038395
the king s procureur alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism				56545.64023823822
what is his name said he				7.705034388359989
taste the hashish guest of mine taste the hashish franz s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth				1263.4153219514235
they might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks				11213.588195461316
the other was in a feminine hand long and crossed				756.6667555698588
no he murmured none of my enemies would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of time that they might now come and crush me with this secret				572.7539614158001
come sir said he addressing broussel silence that woman and follow me silence me				20.078939088666555
but he also was spurred on by a ferocious desire of vengeance				243.00292090170723
barrois asked mademoiselle valentine noirtier nodded his head				10.113227332974786
i had the money with me i made the tenant sign the deed of resilition and when i had obtained what i so much wanted i galloped to auteuil				920.373448993793
come in come in monsieur porthos the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity				16449.647228919544
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly i shall go he said to the queen well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take that opportunity of going to paris to whom zounds				1820.6197764382107
luigi vampa what think you of that inquired franz				39.2355350984683
i bought it from him but it belongs to d artagnan				1.0682220449144526
every soldier must be ambitious must he not				234.38665469625917
but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me				65.6183912078857
from m beauchamp replied florentin				328.7238349685354
the old man wrapped in a large black doublet in which the whole of his slender body was concealed was brisk and dry				50873.09811586719
you hear comminges said the queen				10.058581409326282
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper				1277.9021695984861
now said d artagnan i ve one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges at your service sir you will see the count again to morrow morning will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained you want the cardinal to come here no i know my place and am not so presumptuous				109779.36686236004
at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away				184.58914100497964
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited d artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place				472.30353451848737
perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them				16.767152567530577
keep near me said the latter				172.46793484368453
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said				266.61658496753114
suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name				141.1482144939755
as to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men the soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it				5.848208962892538
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years				846.1845146105585
take care you are going to immure a traveller sinbad the sailor a man who comes to see paris you are going to make a patriarch of him oh no said morrel my sister is five and twenty my brother in law is thirty they are gay young and happy				2446.094624977071
as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port				572.0328581344853
it was fourteen years day for day since dantès arrest				15827.710581090003
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms				6370.102272870515
his guards taking him by the arms and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind				846.0069966571086
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne				9983.725778592372
i don t know what it was				333.8310710982181
the matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for kitty				5107.345018369424
we must extricate ourselves from this position but how listen				99.22463897042762
felton did not enter				1610.7738359633097
having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the side gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house in the champs élysées				100.77600252550644
go said the duke				10.13884235095692
you know anne of austria the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life if you let him go i am a dead man i needed nothing less than that consideration my dear d artagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer				13832.203688069114
the game at tennis which upon a sign from grimaud monsieur de beaufort had consented to play began in the afternoon				9068.361903384237
for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercédès my betrothed the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry edmond dantès then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligible home home the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived				20151.41555294434
what horses asked athos				3.877856471164338
nine tenths of the english people are horrified at what you say this voice was that of athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser				19864.365740721718
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half scared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person				1106.1626250925076
stay said d artagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw d artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms				226.0223284576462
now the queen is of a sensitive nature				2221.565543934253
so the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game				2949.633338565174
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat				60583.327884287544
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another				209.49040213399826
madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself				711.6674521101193
but to her great surprise d artagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better when will you do that immediately i hope ah				87.68217624362252
she must live that my infamy may diminish hers and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage				75.56495796212008
say rather crime replied the doctor				252.238363406792
if the thing were to do again i would again do it villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement				955.5121381382347
the boy found him sitting where d artagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary				1770.6257717133008
ah it is you peppino said the count				7.140129443528145
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family				791.9419293725384
we must seize the felucca said aramis				15.409789581050738
villefort rose and ran towards his mother in law for it was she				18541.034260591157
friend d artagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future				458.28750134192217
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way				885.5831014513004
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly				1654.004300106539
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving d artagnan s composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge you accept however i always accept do you think the thing possible everything is possible shall you be attacked on the road probably and what will you do in that case i shall pass through those who attack me and suppose you can not pass through them so much the worse for them i shall pass over them and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain yes on your life on my life you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration				406.7424326289367
my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world these words carried a ray of hope into fernand s heart				44.275237108659915
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly				7347.257866717527
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do				368.0259801591485
pray go valentine said m de villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfather s is valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m de villefort altered his intention				45794.36958007531
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features				3439.789609193456
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor				8617.268529380399
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart				30.877888940597288
the young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired				3188.842668405228
just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain				576.8818072449976
yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate in four days said morrel it is extraordinary indeed said château renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too				3929.4721229304578
swear to me then never to let them put a crown upon your head unless you have a legal right to the crown				39357.22317234432
decidedly athos you were born to be a general and the cardinal who fancies himself a great soldier is nothing beside you gentlemen said athos no divided attention i beg let each one pick out his man i cover mine said d artagnan				1.03163790761862
come there can not be too many sir said maximilian you are not perhaps aware that i am m de monte cristo s friend i was not sure but i thought it might be so				33.307230248100055
more than a year had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever faria still continuing to instruct dantès by conversing with him sometimes in one language sometimes in another at others relating to him the history of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory				16429.79870411315
it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette				12367.068277781158
i am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills myself this is a magnificent emerald and the largest i have ever seen said château renaud although my mother has some remarkable family jewels i had three similar ones returned monte cristo				1.0752080645497015
while the three gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces franz s attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the mantle and the transtevere peasant				170749.4663293078
he then called for his horses drove to the chamber and inscribed his name to speak against the budget				101167.64036513977
just god he muttered whence comes this thought				1997.9718058053288
i never saw a man with a nobler air than his without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can said porthos				12.601818552641907
the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death				245.7582374368211
the air they breathed was heavy damp and cold				409.34421678744746
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them				18.255251658650014
the same evening all villefort s servants who had assembled in the kitchen and had a long consultation came to tell madame de villefort that they wished to leave				318.65853361492844
or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity				33519.728337497356
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller				104392.78392187398
fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome fate				11452.032110018858
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day				358.0502746442741
i can t see				118.90786181289955
it is true she said the arch hypocrite see i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces				32888.76982062306
that s very kind of him here monsieur said the cardinal to the young man				1.8766906362797475
well try the hotel de luynes raoul and ask if the duchess can receive you				14.359438937958304
yes my son and a sacred command say it my father the house of thomson french is the only one who from humanity or it may be selfishness it is not for me to read men s hearts has had any pity for me				5.203814371020301
little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark				1305.9330961277321
men would have said that the king had escaped human justice and been overtaken by god s				177.65931300862857
knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was characteristic				69982.2083734211
the king s closet at the tuileries we will leave villefort on the road to paris travelling thanks to trebled fees with all speed and passing through two or three apartments enter at the tuileries the little room with the arched window so well known as having been the favorite closet of napoleon and louis xviii and now of louis philippe				78992.95217460387
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousse s letter				158.775543913755
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother				598.895855442602
monseigneur said he my life is yours henceforth dispose of it				10.104476122206433
but monte cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes				59.30601551603548
if you received the work on a physical medium you must return the medium with your written explanation				1715.2436983921148

come in said a voice which he recognized as that of the mendicant whom he found lying on a kind of truckle bed				1021.513784781759
this hole communicated with a kind of loft the space between the floor of the king s room and the ceiling of the one below it				209.85272663896933
i have but one promise and but one heart to give that promise is pledged to you that heart is also yours				409.37330121006687
it seems sir steward said he that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price his excellency is not perhaps aware that m danglars gave francs for his horses very well				143.7272551797082
you are free my brothers				1391.0550462402157

yes monseigneur enemies against whom you owe me all your support for i made them by serving your eminence who are they replied the duke				11.112828127341249
three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were villefort valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken				819.672005016772
i understand now why they murdered him valentine could not help casting one glance towards the young man whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold				118617.75519512309
our partnership began in the month of april				25811.04788489532
and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue sir added caderousse				38.51684309983128
monsieur albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general excuse me said the implacable young girl monsieur albert claims and well deserves his share				16948.0227823169
only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france no jesting upon that subject gentlemen said porthos thank god the queen is still of an age to give one they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france replied aramis with a significant smile which gave to this sentence apparently so simple a tolerably scandalous meaning				3908.0951442477426
it was at this moment d artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor s carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them				13.607322961655987
my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of wine				369.7076558499899

you do not know her replied the stranger				127.8830507708624
my lord who told you that nobody but i know it i regret infinitely to tell you my lord that you are mistaken replied the gascon impudently firm to the promise he had just made to anne of austria				57.39278804296062
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know d artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul				249.23884070683144
you know what athos told you the other day you eat at everybody s mess				253883.7023889126
he opened his eyes				33.855659221386546
m bonacieux was introduced afresh and upon a sign from the cardinal the officer retired				228.8968368808034
alone never again to see the face never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth				410.4998112994661

but where is louise asked the comte				2078.9374438685077
bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was d artagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you				207.1909956692078
how could i then return to brussels				11450.230202825758

the sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franz s mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness				932.7010185001616

la ramee continued my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to morrow en tete a tete grimaud made a sign which meant that he didn t see what that had to do with him				11.785872173750361
fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercédès did not even feel				377182.9294736076
the swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only				2751.578376856023

what in the devil does he say asked the prince				147.24099628595985
the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected something something had occasioned the noise and something must follow				6805.135164424619
i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted may consider himself in safety in comparison with you the devil said d artagnan whom the positive tone of m de tréville began to disquiet the devil				401.2669830478247
there is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church				393.9056493824677
one however fell at the duke s feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket				91.57471261756943
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide no no continued d artagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman				6981.944941239387
grimaud entered				30.331249460605743
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted				54112.469245204156
your horse is tired already he froths at the mouth whilst mine looks as if he had only just left the stable				13221.14241095778

cap de diou				56.695721295598574
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt my faith yes said d artagnan				1.0275895587535202
but he bethought him of m de villefort s promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible				1703.790724557432
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards				7665.475692124044
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival				925.243683246153
but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of château renaud this was followed by rather an awkward silence				854.7525857602839
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness yes said the old man				2.006419930770538

i once knew a bragelonne is he still alive no sir he is dead and i believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which i take my name and your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name the comte de la fere madame replied the young man bowing				314.47994169595654
pardon madame he said i am not a lawyer i am a mere soldier and probably therefore i do not quite comprehend the value of certain words i ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people				284.0200943863043
i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition he had just completed this monologue which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue when the servant maid watching at the door suddenly cried out ah				291.03937759200375
i thought so but we will return to my lord duke presently				376.85983261346945
the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the swiss but yet detail them to me why they may amount to said porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one				171.9304368676638
and now gentlemen that s well continued the cardinal				25.349360813039187
in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st louis above the order of notre dame du mont carmel and st lazare and gave it to villefort in the meanwhile take this cross sire said villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officer s cross ma foi said louis xviii take it such as it is for i have not the time to procure you another				180.17089738498785
it is very evident that it is the letter w which m noirtier wants said the notary				376.4210792328052
a conjugal scene as athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down				113.64439013964258
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem				17890.695577004415
the meetings were always held from that time till midnight				1322.6545904614695
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution				3728.0494563080215
it was mordaunt with the order in his hand				24.39362023629097
your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and i am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require this manner of acting roused much respect for d artagnan s policy among the musketeers				646.4501612851122
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel morrel				133.765927283744
d artagnan picked it up and offered it to lord de winter				7.89069768123962
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action				627.2470276108231
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table				65.08688540622155
grief has consumed her said villefort yes grief doctor				1722.410275445419
the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired				15337.437080721964
yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the money				523.9111042149552
reflect how glorious a day it will be how grand how solemn that day of complete restoration on which you will say in this very office my father died because he could not do what i have this day done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what i should do my father my father cried the young man why should you not live if i live all would be changed if i live interest would be converted into doubt pity into hostility if i live i am only a man who has broken his word failed in his engagements in fact only a bankrupt				8368.998518452872
your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words				757.1240359373527
silence d artagnan said athos				3.12041584069816
d artagnan sprang back the wall had closed again				88.87867723030045
i will be silent then said milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner				1042.430518712051
what is his bearing mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth				319.6721174092532
you have a park and horses servants athos smiled				14.260508423119317
the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension to tell you the truth i consider it lost well then i will buy it of you you yes i but at a tremendous discount of course no for two hundred thousand francs				136.17481653746228
well in that case we can manage famously said d artagnan which of the two horses will you ride that which you bought or the one that was given to you that which was given to me assuredly				6139.601435204845
then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort do not be in such a hurry to do that said valentine with a sad smile				54.15637247897419
at this moment grimaud appeared at the door				6.891380219520158
the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter re entered it				11.38482960247543
and then our gascon with that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed compared himself with de wardes and asked himself why after all he should not be beloved for himself				54.4470733854207
this fawn colored hair or perhaps the sort of ascendancy which she had over other women gave her the name of la lionne mademoiselle paulet took her accustomed seat but before sitting down she cast in all her queen like grandeur a look around the room and her eyes rested on raoul				1378.4434055990698
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement				3512.9059342254627
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti				159.07488053919255
you are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your publisher aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and re buttoned his doublet				2012.7829157032218
it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo				1.037417413648906
it struck me as very odd that a princess should live in the rue aux ours attorney but how do you know all this because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter saying that monsieur porthos was a weathercock and that she was sure it was for some woman he had received this wound has he been wounded then oh good lord				186.00806329160574
milady clarik received d artagnan ceremoniously				50907.653499723936

here guitant spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were progressing				130936.51181886904
barrois therefore as we have seen watched for valentine and informed her of her grandfather s wish				2309.643012067559
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room				687.7817641339556
the count continued i have given him renewed life and hope in the assurance that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen years the major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety				1497.1982728587093
the coming instant would in all probability decide the rest of his life				262.6592395254935
as for planchet he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush the poor lad s strength was almost exhausted				3909.064297387053
yes my pocket has a hole in it oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling				53333.161484339216
and you go into that house cried he briskly				1668.6023361855105

laporte give the light to monsieur the chevalier de coislin the queen touched with her lips the white smooth brow the royal child presented to her with a gravity which already partook of etiquette				3178.792440901409
above this floor was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre eminence				7330.243844520652
but said franz in his turn interrupting his host s meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was ah yes you have ordered your carriage at eight o clock precisely i have you intend visiting il colosseo you mean the colosseum it is the same thing				2018.2523828200297

it is you bernouin she said				53.14044419100781
i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much				410.77139464705516
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated				3227.219535924585
no no cried the countess you must not leave me				5.425766872117985
pardon me at least such i have heard is your custom nay madame				125.87927764523488
dantès was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering				13248.55681208657
after every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges and these reasons howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our lives				19477.144768962648
save me i will not harm you andrea the murderer cried one of the ladies				2147.375845502171
your very devoted husband baron danglars the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his self control change color once or twice				3284.5434988925344
madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child				252.60643761600107
i am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living athos was for a few moments thoughtful				326.0607213374501
where has he gone i do not know what do you mean				33.03570257694494

the next day m noirtier sent for the notary the first will was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his fortune to valentine on condition that she should never be separated from him				4.266942186849581
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling				711.9987342901537
when he came here monsieur d artagnan provoked and braved the soldiers and inferior officers in order i suppose to have his sword back				332.7349888943232
thanks to the garden we yet can flee i have the key but make haste				4338.319036447985
the members apprised of the sort of presentation which was to be made that evening were all in attendance				11939.956233878322
what brings you to paris affairs of importance which you shall know later				2756.8224024838983
a gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by step this is uncommon then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures this indeed is praiseworthy nay more it is sublime albert looked on and listened with astonishment he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm				475.7337462983072
all four came up together				724.9782006282907
i say that she is a hostage for the parisians answered the cardinal				17.507375705941943

the catalans beyond a bare weather worn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the catalans				44808.007246818546
no replied d artagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way ah you surprise me				9.60899924642815
d artagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past m de tréville grasped the situation				1473.0813703643084
athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep				597.8105097535312
what do i see down there by the wall in the direction of the catalans				44808.60550225185

our charming gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful as ever				441.7495377886315
on reaching the palace d artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay				4778.381027423188
she would have taken d artagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache				7650.540559474187
yes i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly				3248.0456434439134
d artagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water				983.5041567614376
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true				347.5465951142621
albert bathed took his supper and went to bed				329.8458648742208
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him				14.750694112482117
m andrea at his departure inherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the marquis bartolomeo and the marchioness oliva corsinari				2270.2893364041374

you are in constant communication with the baron danglars the count inquired of albert de morcerf				63.918997348349926
d artagnan went to the window with his habitual composure				5781.372735555098
a bad joke of the husband s substituted the other but the husband has been punished since and i have obtained full satisfaction planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn leading their masters steeds				2183.4647981412736

lord de winter exclaimed the count				8.871944474072146
gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted				106476.01320918064
perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you when i am married no they told you then that m d épinay consented to our all living together yes then why are you still vexed and grieved the old man s eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection				3188.5324895218682
monsieur de mazarin is not a man of genius as i thought he is a man of no origin once a servant of cardinal bentivoglio and he got on by intrigue				9952.687333967917
in the first place i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find it his threat completed the intimidation of the host				344.78836491089055
oh as to that i do not engage myself				176.5518325241351
albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera				482.5266442229628
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table				159.94584680022336
cromwell had sent him to mazarin				320.2582961796439

and as much at least in pearls diamonds and jewels said eugénie				99.74070531336245
her friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution				47485.193126464554
madame de villefort remained immersed in thought				1151.9489757611018
they breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all				112.20348193309958
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women				1801.2245519069043
and besides he said going out of this chamber isn t all dear friend said porthos you appear to be in a somewhat better humor to day than you were yesterday				2855.0300690858903
peppino remained breathless				90.17118669347522
sir said he to danglars understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the count of monte cristo he bowed to the banker and went out with beauchamp without appearing to notice cavalcanti				616.3651532091232
we shall soon succeed in sending him to join his boon companions				681.6810514917627
he was notwithstanding anxious to set out but his illness becoming more serious he was forced to stop at villeroy				27397.430162586657
now an englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us and our masters asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion mousqueton smiled disdainfully				963.8810211889257
that s the thing replied the gascon				51.440589598547064
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother ah excuse me then said d artagnan				1.0248012542609257
behind her but in deep shadow was the outline of a masculine figure but the features of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish				7744.252172443832
remember if you talk if you babble if you get drunk you risk your master s head who has so much confidence in your fidelity and who answers for you				10.644820570602175
the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries				37355.07250553297
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak and that milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken				742.7196566034961
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying hand to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a man a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief				1879649.9969330542
well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy				125516.72814691937
i am disposed to believe your eminence he replied though i have had but little evidence of that good nature of which your eminence speaks				5342.0180077976665
emmanuel did not conceal his joy at the peaceful termination of the affair and was loud in his expressions of delight				919.1975949552822
meanwhile villefort and d avrigny had made all possible haste valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified twofold				259386.6134060993
villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin				1228.441471730242
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man				153.18929594745467
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there in sardinian				68388.2636498422
the cardinal s house had no secrets for me				18.414148624328817
no longer could edmond look into those wide open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed				34180.78054527309
monsieur morrel said valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather m noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you				20.322095378604214
and you have come here with that purpose grimaud repeated the sign				20181.26379805259
are you alone athos parbleu whom do you expect to find with me at this hour well well and d artagnan rushed into athos s chamber				788.8950661867015
this arm is paralyzed not for a time but forever				639.1683542308328
nothing but saddles now do you understand said athos				4.18984873896715
after the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from m de tréville entered bringing a sealed packet				147598.39098699822
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated them				11.432667185069718
there he is somebody has disturbed him without doubt said d artagnan				1.0494902136365438
the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually				33495.8895080734
i must absolutely see it i shall find a way no nonsense caderousse i will offer myself as floor polisher the rooms are all carpeted well then i must be contented to imagine it that is the best plan believe me try at least to give me an idea of what it is how can i nothing is easier				137921.6687179723
you have promised me to go said the queen				9.54635403896021
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest				626.0607448876527
it was estimated at fifty thousand francs bless me exclaimed caderousse fifty thousand francs				242.77267487946006
stop i want to remember his exact words				332.1776062780374
ah said the count you have then not forgotten that i saved your life that is strange for it is a week ago no excellency and never shall i forget it returned peppino with an accent of profound gratitude				2300.230508356286
the court of his hôtel situated in the rue du vieux colombier resembled a camp from by six o clock in the morning in summer and eight o clock in winter				14375.59146474791
he is really king of paris he can t go out without being mobbed by his admirers ah				316.73885131165264
bonacieux for such protestations may be made with the worst intentions in the world but the voice was all				618.5551058826693
franz coolly cocked both barrels				39831.180699710276
now the four friends began to speak loud scarcely waiting till one had finished before another began and each assumed his favorite attitude on or at the table				133.01988630742906
but poor captain leclere what happened to him asked the owner with an air of considerable resignation				20058.615315350515
come this is no longer our home the words died away the steps were lost in the distance				698.8456437759459
you notice my ring said the gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his friends				60.17308679877516
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know				365.0046061692084
the carriage rolled rapidly onward				1400.4458603554503
he remained there all night not knowing where he was				130.08460459290785
dantès had entered the château d if with the round open smiling face of a young and happy man with whom the early paths of life have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past				3247.3921203022783
but i must not forget one grand point which that i have been singularly assisted nonsense i have indeed by circumstances no by you by me				28.158765087753288
then when the cardinal had ended alas sir				405.6420942474221
begone and may god guide you amen cried the young man and set off at full gallop				357.1143538324551

aha said the brigadier stopping the servant the person who is ringing appears to want something more than a waiter we will attend upon him with a gendarme				22044.18103589428
i will ask the cardinal it was the cardinal then who informed you of this fête yes madame replied the astonished king but why do you ask that it was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs that is to say madame it was he sire it was he well and what does it signify whether it was he or i				347.56615099385954
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them i countenance nothing that is marvellous m albert				64.56775080737215
nearly four years had passed away at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time				300.6646607149175
patience had in vain been recommended to them by reports of brilliant victories gained by france laurels however were not meat and drink and the people had for some time been in a state of discontent				26640.99643603689
i said nothing for we must have peace in the house and francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much				389.9829721180777
d artagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand				14.625672258570384
what s to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do i must then remain here here or in the neighborhood you can not take me with you no the order is imperative				284573.35507508693
for the last time where are you going to the devil answered d artagnan				1.0376198306037925
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him				6.627499627386291
he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the carriage				149.94773619478232
good day dear friend replied d artagnan				1.038655878231668
your body is covered with a coating of fat which preserves it from the cold air ah				460.81627149669913
it was then that the door of edward s room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared				31765.242499187032
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to monte cristo now he added with a sigh it is you who will conduct me thither				39117.326982727354
the reference is no doubt to the wistaria frutescens ed				938.0590897628573
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm				552.9505170190853
he was if i recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many others then he added monsieur you may rest assured i shall perform my duty impartially and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and i must do my duty as he had now arrived at the door of his own house which adjoined the palais de justice he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the spot where villefort had left him				5.686460576196694
why to converse with him of course				9515.84131610349
twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in england she was already married in france				146.61206835575794
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned				17533.869449965812
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing				339766.98378321656
you understand dantès relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience				8497.18422486388
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game				19411.611733974285
i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which it produces				18542.97939451484
march it seems that i am named la bruyere remarked d artagnan				1.0328471675512119
i know it monsieur everything is turned topsy turvy in the world nowadays while this dialogue was going on the two young men and the poor lackey descended				26690.484041714695
i will answer for that you know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination				5857.431860647298
porthos did the same				129.65879044488364

open it is i but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained closed				392.37781492673656
his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal				218.35521872733287
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of spain				3903.6103513555895
it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan that is true said the king but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him				5.499690879336063
do you see the waistcoat				3871.7032823776526
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton				98.47242068831918
oh not the least in the world madame				3136.962116703925
i gave it away in a night of love as it has been given to you d artagnan became pensive in his turn it appeared as if there were abysses in milady s soul whose depths were dark and unknown				129311.00357124589
as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him				8.160285574739138
what sort of a man is he ask the vicomte de morcerf you hear m de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess				69.53006856502743
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart				24.766849242140772
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master				2394.785094016215
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor				988.3445578354755
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution				2344.1181050064324
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it				7.6821424109570815
well said beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend i am broken hearted said albert				37.295872216813294

he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and maximilian and emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within				21783.120239002805
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle very well said d artagnan his eyes aflame battle				3253.2382323341485
it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail				11970.237988324618
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan				2975.52596666197
milady recoiled uttering a cry				738.7013295522493
have you brought your arms i what for				250.51900221165636
what have we all done then dear grandpapa said valentine you no longer seem to love any of us the old man s eyes passed rapidly from villefort and his wife and rested on valentine with a look of unutterable fondness				16224.485158416983
one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome				546.1963440691783
can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future				461.1917305908702
ah madame said comminges hastening to d artagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector				1305.543333193854
whenever you hesitate as to whom you ought to serve abandon the exterior the material appearance for the invisible principle for the invisible principle is everything				4272.359182402122
the weapon as we have already stated was plunged into the body to the hilt and as the surgeon taking it by the end drew it forth the wounded man opened his eyes and fixed them on him in a manner truly frightful				5702.058098107844
their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right				2727.5837862754524
another person was confined in the château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest ah indeed mad repeated monte cristo and what was his mania he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty monte cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him and the firmament				57931.48047811933
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said				84.30213864934612
the ribbons which held them have been cut with scissors if my lord suspects they have been stolen perhaps the person who stole them still has them in his hands wait wait said the duke				10.814274824375143
if i am not saved i shall be avenged you are not a woman said athos coldly and sternly				27939.634519471012
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				7595.884467620959
don t you think so d artagnan i think so indeed cried he				11.480826213031724
the insult chapter				1.8466896865219784
i have brought him up				236.4826093763835
the marshal bit his fingers				2793.5690398348775
i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses indeed said monte cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent				18635.466516198627
if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received				190.36391965909155
on your knees count athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula i make you a knight				69396.02825909194
bonacieux yes there are traitors here but by the holy name of the virgin i swear that no one is more devoted to your majesty than i am				467.49446289214967
here it is at last he said not without some trouble though yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting as he said this the man came towards edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence				3653.652487986813
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins				98933.29165421406
have you been working all night				743.6601825087506
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued				1992.7188269420096
sir said d artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman				1300.0864520112902
don t worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to smile it is nothing it is nothing i was giddy that is all another attack of giddiness said morrel clasping his hands				32.413368253226004
have you by any chance been in the bastile no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it ah				225.3929332731369
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot				5769.096093078059
this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d artagnan s adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the fight a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness muttering nevertheless a plague upon these gascons				14184.688733201454
at the sixth cabaret then as we said d artagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him				5.378821234490552
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed renée you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint méran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past				1782.4132713549802
the young man s finger glided over the words but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign				922.7147119159224
but hear me continued she				23.650312569722214
so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction				363.0757022417221
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you like that is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached				229.299832724291
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them				46.35204099925534
contact the foundation as set forth in section below				2991.0986316780377
be satisfied beautiful constance				823.0406095321122
athos merely glanced at it				9.710295201610807
the room of the retired baker chapter				4.847231728838579
he was thinking of mme				27.956836681554357
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness				2456.14616432829
to whom then to your new master who and where is he he is here and kourchid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the death of my father said haydée in a tone of chastened anger				501.1629727402208
i never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more				428.82257808291524
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villefort s departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind				171.59864501900407
my sword				165.31377032297613
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy				15777.706248766337
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation				5661.732468676186
mordioux answered d artagnan i believe we must				54173.81152644843
for me said d artagnan are you sure of that pardieu monsieur i can t be more sure				441.94126414350245
and when is the wedding to be he asked				20.23140305369388
well for my part i shall go to bed said d artagnan come porthos porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend				171.5347518963564
one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting these words redoubled the eagerness of d artagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace				441.10859651526124
d artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st leu and followed him instinctively				16326.99047730885
with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet				8277.320357262339
june and july were the terrible months with athos				156.33870527821657
the jailer stared				408.87739223254295
she wept abundantly and let us speak it to the praise of m d artagnan the younger notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm as a future musketeer ought nature prevailed and he shed many tears of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half				2471.7558787327166
and now gentlemen i repeat excuse me but on that account only and on guard at these words with the most gallant air possible d artagnan drew his sword				121.13371609912232
have i friends				204.6230234715986
he meets albert de morcerf in italy it is to rescue him from the hands of the banditti he introduces himself to madame danglars it is that he may give her a royal present your step mother and her son pass before his door it is that his nubian may save them from destruction				19986.607957654993
are you sir the chief of the people who brought me here yes your excellency				885.8534012085197
then i thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose i was your accomplice so i took what little money i had and the best of my things and i got away				85.1720678722188
follow me mr commissary said the brigadier tread in my steps wait an instant said the host number has two staircases inside and outside good said the brigadier				3054.3046981135267

employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads my dear monsieur de rochefort mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails you				19.20580988615173
the whole establishment had been changed another valet was engaged for himself a new servant for noirtier two women had entered madame de villefort s service in fact everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new faces were presented to the different masters of the house thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family				733.1274805755722
in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the post the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking				6620.1701964375525
his looking glass had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper				38684.315264043784
are people to be run against without warning				1933.4521791083785
i wish i were on board already and he looked back again				68.44404303651476
what is the matter				47.454494991133345
but à propos resumed m de tréville what has become of your three companions i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them none monsieur well i left them on my road porthos at chantilly with a duel on his hands aramis at crèvecœur with a ball in his shoulder and athos at amiens detained by an accusation of coining see there now said m de tréville and how the devil did you escape by a miracle monsieur i must acknowledge with a sword thrust in my breast and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais like a butterfly on a tapestry there again				270.3525037534674
how do you feel this morning he inquired				603.8607817168506
mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times frederick of prussia used to be				1276.797284373056
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly only they had agreed to meet once a week about one o clock at the residence of athos seeing that he in agreement with the vow he had formed did not pass over the threshold of his door				146.96862317566698
merciful goodness whispered aramis to athos did you see what asked athos				4.3961261763697275
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist				2185.1031526965226
a man has carried off your mistress a man has seduced your wife a man has dishonored your daughter he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart				28.826709651023876
the queen is too virtuous and besides loves your majesty too well woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal but if the queen be guilty let her tremble indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it				10.325981064583152
de sévigné				8.008492251336225
great god cried d artagnan loosing his hold of her dress and remaining mute motionless and frozen				5944.664913153642
one only chance was left me that of beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the abbé busoni who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that morning				943.6868532087886
so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hour s time he stopped before a little isolated house				581.2843762253906
it was chance that threw me in your way i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends one of your friends interrupted mme				18.518059986920704
d artagnan then looked around attentively				297768.2157810335
she cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was cruel				127561.92258211976
then you know him almost screamed the countess				73.56631584754983
and you said athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter s name				158.648628861966
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind d artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice				136.80847603448328
perhaps god will pardon you but i never for pity s sake said the executioner extending his arms				166.4551771030073
his honor s equipage is waiting said mousqueton				121.10853489598269

haydée chapter				3.4380027243614584
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions				44561.69435804118
for the pleasure of a meeting with you i would go to the end of the world very well to morrow sir i shall rely on it				7.5147329867395865
pardieu said d artagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long no said aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the philipghauts and how were they treated asked d artagnan				97.39686298006636
he turned towards his wife				103.04081379883597
but your wife monsieur what has she to do with all this her devotion to the queen is known and they wish either to remove her from her mistress or to intimidate her in order to obtain her majesty s secrets or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy that is likely said d artagnan but the man who has abducted her do you know him i have told you that i believe i know him his name i do not know that what i do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal his evil genius but you have seen him yes my wife pointed him out to me one day has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him oh certainly he is a noble of very lofty carriage black hair swarthy complexion piercing eye white teeth and has a scar on his temple a scar on his temple cried d artagnan and with that white teeth a piercing eye dark complexion black hair and haughty carriage why that s my man of meung he is your man do you say yes yes but that has nothing to do with it				6.439879615442796
you know not then anything of your birth you have never seen your mother yes my lord she came three times whilst i was a child to my nurse s house i remember the last time she came as well as if it were to day you have a good memory said mazarin				33.02758308355903
oh yes yes be assured i shall save you				9.065131482468635
brought up in paris where raoul had been but once at the court which raoul had never seen his follies as page two duels which he had already found the means of fighting in spite of the edicts against them and more especially in spite of his tutor s vigilance these things excited the greatest curiosity in raoul				563.1841828215662
he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary				3532.8051287835665
those barrels i saw through the door port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum				440.3841605064782
what cried d artagnan is your first witness monsieur porthos yes that disturbs you by no means and here is the second d artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos and perceived aramis				160.10922023214445
well sir said the young girl do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject but before the notary could answer villefort had drawn him aside				6821.177564108971
do you hear the guns pray				1932.5534947344984
this time the illusion or rather the reality surpassed anything valentine had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her reason was this time not deceived made her shudder				1214.4881131707436
behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions				40507.46210365334
let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the comte de la fere said d artagnan for the count must be furious comminges began to laugh				292.5582320009611
the marshal then entered the rue saint honore but there he was opposed by the barricades of the mendicant of saint eustache				2254.737767208719
yes i understand was the reply contained in his look and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt				724.9685211896494
at length he interrogates me said milady to herself at the height of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result				9809.314993764718
they arrived at ablain without accident				6906.594062382688
before we are alarmed we see correctly when we are alarmed we see double and when we have been alarmed we see nothing but trouble				12727.872211670085
it was evident that he shared his master s apprehensions				46232.43829601798
i know no better means than to act with candor				20421.062614554452
bonacieux became livid a fearful agony pervaded her frame and she sank panting into the arms of porthos and aramis				16.621175723000455
there was no time to lose				3545.8475228945726
it is very easy he went on with a smile i will remain here rush on the first person that opens the door strangle him and then they will guillotine me but excessive grief is like a storm at sea where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave				75288.24152296425
with what my father said just now he returned a sign in the negative				6615.872108128939
athos now descended the ladder in his turn without losing sight of the young man				3.56456656619079
he was very successful upon that question				646.8463857864816
if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests				3373.618377634826
monsieur de mazarin had thought that we had rendered service to general cromwell instead of king charles which would have been a disgrace rebounding from us to him and from him to your majesty a dishonor which would have tainted the royalty of your illustrious son				631.8947461373532
bonacieux he will rouse the whole quarter bonacieux called a long time but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer s house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac				6324.28613334084
the count pretends i have not him to thank so be it i will erect an altar deo ignoto listen said monte cristo i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the father in law and the young man there is only mademoiselle eugénie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me and do you say this wedding is at hand oh yes in spite of all i could say				236.57509368643096
or solitary confinement				337.3407541025762
if you succeed i do not say that you will save a king no in presence of the scaffold as i am royalty i assure you is a very small affair but you will save a husband to his wife a father to his children				2377.2593633280167
lucullus dines with lucullus porthos looked at the bottle which was near him and hoped that with wine bread and cheese he might make a dinner but wine was wanting the bottle was empty				342.82241156964386
d artagnan went straight to the stables day was just dawning				227092.07008635797
and you did not awaken me i wished to leave you still to enjoy some moments of sleep my child you must be fatigued from yesterday oh sir how good you are athos smiled				30.2833494880728
the queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care				3618.79124907993
in person and fortunately it seems for you my young friend				41.15318684483642
the duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that la ramee should seat himself opposite				944277.0584998656

mademoiselle danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor				5507.188873011409
now said planchet let us thank the queen				15.423179704900525
at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos				182.31216764902
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke				1564.5959947238525
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms				131.35241620563897
did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem				56608.01321365539
you have not played for a long time i said you ought then to have a good hand well what then well the englishman and his companion are still here				288.12638466351103

edmond was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to dantès chamber				190.42910553723016
after a moment s silence the lady inquired do you know my dear count she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium				155615.7150671526
if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed him				6.0473614858143945

besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets				17652.978833489455
they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans				61786.18117237907

the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue				230804.01890076263
but nothing escaped the count s notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister s secretary				73516.14175435457
i want to know what crime i have committed to be tried and if i am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty are you well fed said the inspector				32.09506616456667

you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough				285.70400884283646
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine				13009.069191332748
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black				3482.6077709640613
we are compelled to admit to our readers that d artagnan thought nothing about him in any way or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be				98.8720207292959

madame danglars had started when villefort on the count s invitation offered his arm and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own				145.0513727569293
henceforth valentine you will never again be separated on earth since he has rushed into death to find you				15.055969960121134

but as to what had been done by porthos and d artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau				1735.7289344139342

valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event				1741.758125564932
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived athos and became thoughtful she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan				1622.806700546686
franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host				488.40684531488415
bonacieux at home it was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king				64.69793165695697
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together				343.44170596980933
besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses				17089.89313799492

and now where is he gone inquired d artagnan				1.0415092706323117
give way at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late				376.4085150334544

scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him				7.031820627396033
of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile				124.5467667657246
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper				13600.999471431951

for a hundred pistoles i have discovered a secret for which richelieu would have paid twenty thousand crowns without reckoning the value of that diamond he cast a complacent look at the ring which he had kept instead of restoring to d artagnan which is worth at least ten thousand francs he returned to his room and after depositing the ring in a casket filled with brilliants of every sort for the cardinal was a connoisseur in precious stones he called to bernouin to undress him regardless of the noises of gun fire that though it was now near midnight continued to resound through paris				182.80548441269767

this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find d artagnan				1.0683038254796384

villefort was about to retire but m de blacas taking his hand restrained him				4.742770940535554

well sir said morrel sinking into a chair you have heard all and i have nothing further to tell you i see returned the englishman that a fresh and unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you and this only increases my desire to serve you oh sir cried morrel				33.814534090371716
the viscount of morcerf can only wed a marchioness but two million francs make a nice little sum replied morcerf				82.79668586627672
nineteen returned dantès				59.29657097796545
sire murmured lord leven crushed by shame sire we are ready to give you every proof of our fidelity i ask but one said the king put the army in battle array and face the enemy that can not be sire said the earl				97029.1866089916
condé himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him				214.00833383717998
milady recognized his step				498.74040198420283
but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have the good fortune to be beloved by you				19.63486559444716
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived				15353.930481254034
d artagnan cried she is it you				160.0999062879419
yesterday s affair must have shaken him a little his voyage would upset him quite planchet was sent for and instructions were given him				14.920418674420866
i wish to see everything if your majesty wishes to look out well then look replied d artagnan				1.0385245085091128
good day commander ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him				17.577414634758956
madame said athos when must we set out you consent then exclaimed the queen joyfully				1285.3922434971794
and m de monte cristo king of china emperor of cochin china said the young imp looking slyly towards his sister				922.0751959393567
the most humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans bless with holy water sprinklers which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers				43599.01348329757
well asked the duke				12.217086591218287
the haste which the young woman was in to convey to the queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words				829.2422982184661
athos nevertheless was visibly anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question				396.40244927431627
these thoughts gilded as they were by a last reflection of love were not the less sad				4863.536010955283
and for whom for some grisette some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some garrison				12000.871217437334
he was incessantly attacked by them and the superior to whom he had confided this misfortune wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them had advised him in order to conjure away the tempting demon to have recourse to the bell rope and ring with all his might				775.0351050725742
for his death the death of your prince yes how so because he has made his will in my favor indeed on my honor for how much for five hundred thousand only that				365.6542076284191

i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear and i set fire to the villa san felice to procure a wedding dress for my betrothed an hour afterwards luigi vampa was chosen captain vice cucumetto deceased well my dear albert said franz turning towards his friend what think you of citizen luigi vampa i say he is a myth replied albert and never had an existence and what may a myth be inquired pastrini				25607.571506051554
they arrived that very moment at the gate of the town guarded by two sentinels				15291.577251232484
they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate				61897.35260792098
but said debray to beauchamp if i spoke to the president you must have been with the procureur it was an impossibility for the last week m de villefort has secluded himself				48.214012309723536
well then you must give me your word to return immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this man tonight				86982.04134056273
the devil				18.90679370397141
monsieur mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently not to refuse you afterward				1110.5296200278597
to conspire against my honor with madame de chevreuse madame de longueville and the condés oh sire what an idea				936.7190381427889
this noise redoubled when d artagnan with a company of musketeers placed himself at the gates of notre dame to secure the service of the church				717.287435374645
imprudent thrice imprudent no monsieur be satisfied nobody saw her replied d artagnan and he related to m de tréville how the affair came to pass				839.7399898634812
hold your tongue said he and let me answer				147.8633149743151
let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me a little of what is going on in the world yonder chapter xxvii				146.21851438326246
oh no he was afraid to encounter him face to face i do not condemn you albert i only restrain you				10.158775541594157
d artagnan was over him at a bound and said to the englishman pointing his sword to his throat i could kill you my lord you are completely in my hands but i spare your life for the sake of your sister d artagnan was at the height of joy he had realized the plan he had imagined beforehand whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted upon his face				111.72959472289136
morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but monte cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp				445.8005414178502
but dantès was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man				3.256236732821345
my husband could accompany me but do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor you have ample proof to the contrary if you look opposite said the baroness as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek				7951.260728546972
and why were you alone because you had been arrested edmond and were a prisoner and why was i arrested				924.6989732978981
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror				1317.2404989408672
oh good lord monsieur chevalier said she what are you doing i said d artagnan nothing and he read you have not answered my first note				3990.5340019282626
villefort had calculated rightly				161.2614379182022
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses				773.8386372135861
is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him				4.965511993552637
see the fatal example on the vendomois road d artagnan you so brave and you porthos so valiant and so strong you were beaten to day aramis and i are beaten in our turn				146.69549481064084
why do you remember when it forgets				59684.64040153231
how can i if her husband fails in controlling her asked lucien you know the character of the baroness no one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases ah if i were in your place said albert				34.68067559149774
haydée saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her two auditors she continued when my mother recovered her senses we were before the seraskier				26929.18391331197
you will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your turn yes monseigneur				1984.4067370380233
well i can weather the storm i whom notwithstanding you tax with fear not with bravado that is not my way but i am firm				1507.5126558943064
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but d artagnan confined himself to telling them that m de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused				10670.95616188319
respect to fallen majesty				501.3962647949153
it is a folly i admit but still it is the fashion				2177.137501176521
the tower of st jacques de la boucherie				44.37554849498497
your mode of life as a smuggler said he to me one day will be the ruin of you if you get out don t take it up again but how inquired i am i to maintain myself and my poor sister a person whose confessor i am replied he and who entertains a high regard for me applied to me a short time since to procure him a confidential servant				564.6224749773302
you may join me at the hôtel des gardes				2288.1248948669404
well porthos follow my examples walk back and forth till some news of our friends reaches us or till we are visited by a good idea				1447.9810579487737
and yet he said i must admit that i sent for you to appoint you to quiet service i have certain apprehensions well what is the meaning of that in fact a great noise was heard in the ante chamber at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man covered with dust rushed into it exclaiming my lord the cardinal				43.601088313341954
dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings				277927.9396980899
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it				7.154309523804651
the fate of our friends to say nothing of our own is perhaps in that very despatch this young man must not however fail in his duty said athos				4.59957607156158
although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends				128.25666739100507
no less said athos as pale as a corpse				519.5217654932725
and aramis i have seen him also said d artagnan but he seemed to me cold ah you have seen aramis said athos turning on d artagnan a searching look				150.4213162924997
he would never think of faring in the same manner as his master he only drank from the cask				10788.209528573989
three quarters of an hour after barrois returned bringing the notary with him				18.60838631371192
almost instantly a female head was put out at the window with two fingers placed upon her mouth either to enjoin silence or to send him a kiss				3903.8523390964483
before he had spoken a word the count saw in the next room a veiled woman who had followed closely after baptistin and now seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and swords on the table rushed in				256.94608373526347
laporte pointed to the child who was asleep				638.1110362513031
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer				15708.8223706133
four men carried me from paris to châlons walking six leagues a day madame de villefort followed the litter in her carriage				116.84302368645758
a man of from thirty five to forty years of age dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young woman dressed after the eastern style				998.8873006713984
how he had found grace in the eyes of the minister he did not know but without doubt m de cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the guards had found him at home				477.11611804739715
realizing this villefort came to the rescue of the crest fallen minister instead of aiding to crush him				9.489857878875078
and when				56.614567414267185
i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms				704.9315461077089
and you porthos faith				253.68146538882988
he had recognized by certain unmistakable signs that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy				8122.480457028389
ah sir replied raoul her fall is a very serious one and without any ostensible injury the physician fears she will be lame for life this is terrible said athos				5.04369360052383
i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys are leading about				13564.444735637118
look here				60.31795852212832
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old				409.942913163848
anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their steeds aramis				562.5003402074302
it is said that we must not trust to the face but in what then shall we place confidence if not in the most beautiful work of the lord				4148.11794720591
at last raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet again				623.3092961581065
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance				4400.254452357156
you may retire said milady				34.53451593303697
danglars accompanied him to the door where he again assured albert that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the count of morcerf				239.80234133774297
tell me on what footing your household was established by your first husband and although i am only your brother in law i will arrange one similar my first husband cried milady looking at lord de winter with eyes almost starting from their sockets				11742.407528683712
porthos could hardly keep his countenance				125.69855543704692
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his				192.8821226596841
sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other men i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings				11743.415430860123
i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday oh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rival s attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly pale				257.41932925314586
notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated				9182.680060515877
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp				612.0087723798048
d artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon				503.94802841557316
what next de wardes can not boast of anything how is that				134.23761462533759
at the same hour as on the preceding evening d artagnan retired				217.19850202550512
well asked he what now				80.65202165760898
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it no madame no the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features				2155.4350713078197
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open				1073.75806347583
she bore me rapidly away				149.3578750451157
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening				19472.743026328742
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity				5704.581845002317
pardon my frankness dear friend				181.02015858055427
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting of course of course said the prisoners anyone can see he s a gentleman well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper				17096.658226377178
then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited				48659.788075012744
i tell you the queen does not love me i tell you she loves another i tell you she loves that infamous buckingham				681.1488260674835
then you were going to rueil yes				154.49372852117574
your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which i am deputed to see you				12.132065558283553
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort				24.193166174049434
they soon arrived at the silent solitary inn				712.3794238818695
continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster				64310.29646095937
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped				130625.82786189967
at the sight of papers of all sorts titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i found nothing				235.77337651707336
scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight				4457.476278214534
ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal				160.40602295524408
however be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work				1204.7375589581384
apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among men madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful				363.03190350323524
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop				369.7231697261041
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet				598.1415540246627
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening				305.8687154280277
you are still with us i presume more than ever				119.22250704037091
there seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king louis xviii was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphius s rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horace a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch				6367.199083238678
age produces good sense and as i doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation i want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to mine rather say to take him back with you into the world				105.95918676081288
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them				15.108347303737842
does your majesty wish me to drop the subject by no means my dear duke but just stretch out your hand which whichever you please there to the left here sire i tell you to the left and you are looking to the right i mean on my left yes there				191.0583225979467
madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawing room a visitor inquired valentine much agitated who is it some grand personage a prince i believe they said the count of monte cristo i will come directly cried valentine aloud				430.5617090260273
d artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry				5707.602018025596
to horse my friends to horse and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to béthune				15624.436585168693
after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down				113.82780812933
the two brigands looked at each other for a moment the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow				170.6915703677469
the dead are everywhere said morrel did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris maximilian said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles				202.37993732750837
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes				52.589816940450994
he whose intellect was thus supreme raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away				95.54679131106262
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law				1874.5112703155921
the first moments of her captivity were terrible a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature				6852.00350833419
adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme				62.961401134115796
d artagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbé d herblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend				175.64947852038128
this night i am determined to be free and if i defend myself or call or cry out i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman at this moment the clock struck				1309.8758555626753
now said athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and i will watch in a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to france but the benign aspect of protecting providence				723.8931805254387
about seven o clock in the morning they set out				58.00381173914119
morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied dantès				88.7302147844755
now although la ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of henry iv				33.89733543373629
a fine thing indeed grunted porthos				22.09937011641616
go away he said				2.7611744473587625
as for winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were petrified				5867.506635375094
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring				15372.552572156046
what do you think of this he asked in a low voice				21.18295118219231
m de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel				628.3600480033303
but pride restrained him and he did not utter it				12.181018547340617
he went to him				7.497731554300601
the two friends having agreed to leave blaisois and grimaud at compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres				107314.38985624001
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign				990.2919151856883
we have arranged the ransom of each of them on arriving in france				114.96047516753926
all my researches have been useless				71.43427865107748
on the seventh of january between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property				8965.32820639149
there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house the only title i desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day				260.1895560457355
do you hear that madame				133.4582659747228
athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him				11.03837060134915
in gascony tis no dishonor sir nobody is rich and henry iv of glorious memory who was the king of the gascons as his majesty philip iv				43.863169340435796
my wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with her				66.7845526183632

why did you leave the closet monsieur d artagnan asked the cardinal				17.826311753921168
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet d artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant				152.3890523540475
when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom				756.0460617402059

d artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing				280.4513368589699
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes				9499.547482700698

but m de tréville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queen s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful				34305.79118131861
a young and beautiful girl with hair as black as jet her eyes as velvety as the gazelle s was leaning with her back against the wainscot rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor her arms bare to the elbow brown and modelled after those of the arlesian venus moved with a kind of restless impatience and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her well turned leg in its red cotton gray and blue clocked stocking				120159.94142132046
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way perhaps replied d artagnan				1.0265344379452135

but when the time came to pay for his rosemary this oil and the wine the only expense the master had incurred as he had preserved a strict abstinence while on the contrary the yellow horse by the account of the hostler at least had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done d artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained for as to the letter addressed to m de tréville it had disappeared				155.24919685234443

porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles				2526.610164061123
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion				1124.7780811000328
my god my god said she thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer give me then strength to suffer the door opened gently the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued god of vengeance				236.04594094708193
i respect old age but i don t much like it boiled or roasted and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt				2308.193024212623
very well said he				5.957796817871225
he is calling you said the count he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom death would have separated you calls you to him				38.77450737607492

oh meddle in nothing which concerns me				5.4817249883436325

he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords				93555.4034130527
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglars so be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned				5824.477647824588
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded				1031807.5640036814

i the offspring of a noble family who placed reliance upon your friendship i was near dying of my wounds at first and of hunger afterward in a beggarly inn at chantilly without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to you but monsieur porthos murmured the procurator s wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was wrong				1154.1300796784822
for stealing for stealing				10344.736632367023
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark				26961.150870694295

let us talk of something else said he				8.711518788990585

albert was punctual				65.4262127722663
i feel myself quite in a humor for it and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine upon my word the drum draws near said d artagnan				1.0313225983978365
i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs				1426.7535404164948

there was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age				1296.9348368991266
and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt				24339.954482257457
come he said if i pay you the francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease certainly said peppino				229.31710888661502
yes he continued sadly shaking his head yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us				49.143748263297645
he has grown a good deal it seems to me and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place				314.4892390881355
it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes				18792.96772857507
go and tell m albert that and he may know what to answer you oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose you are right				161.46849637987637
the perspiration poured forth upon the young man s brow and he felt as if he should faint				30636.03510275215
five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort				3.742119194641818
the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin				7874.057195745935
by the bye he said i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for porthos and d artagnan the thing is done dear friend said athos i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself you are a wonderful man my dear count said aramis you think of everything well have you made up your mind to this journey quite and now that i reflect about it i am glad to leave paris at this moment and so am i replied athos my only regret is not having seen d artagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project when supper was over blaisois entered				32.76833373206182
is it you said he i am here is your jailer gone yes said dantès he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before us i can work then said the voice				262.85369277297
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion				293.79445835892545
bonacieux what is it it is the uniform of the cardinal s guards				731.5061648011805
there is however a proverb current in france relating to water which is quiet continue said the queen				10.48652375081447
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are no but thanks to this diamond replied the young man				1.664122317395816
at the end of a long corridor with which the door communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the right albert s breakfast room looking into the court and on the left the salon looking into the garden				167.43009004344577
if a man had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father your mother your betrothed a being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breast do you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain yes i know said franz that human justice is insufficient to console us she can give blood in return for blood that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to grant i will put another case to you continued the count that where society attacked by the death of a person avenges death by death				185.09179629323546
morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o clock and to bring emmanuel				1172.1523871653242
you have done your duty and your conscience will be at rest valentine fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting heart				242.52795948575323
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way				754.0956944456752
ah you will tell all i have said will you not reverend sir yes and much more what more will you say i will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house in the hope the count would kill you				11.888501023301895
meanwhile barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier who having heard the noise in the house had as we have said sent his old servant to inquire the cause on his return his quick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger				4971.924897420878
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment why so				13.079478105447086
everyone hastened to purchase moccoletti franz and albert among the rest				325.5059823064888
the other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato and he your excellency is poor peppino the fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example but peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes				34013.8997466193
the crime which i have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just done come be candid said the coadjutor you have not all your life followed the trade which you do now no my lord				21.837593258427116
it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which villefort left the palais				76451.83677308644
if you know monsieur de tréville you must have visited him often said milady who having entered this track and perceiving that falsehood succeeded was determined to follow it to the end				436.563862096049
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he bowed to morcerf who replied with the most impertinent look possible				471.7070999614064
he certainly bodes us no good said athos but let us embark once out at sea let him come and athos sprang into the boat which was immediately pushed off and which soon sped seawards under the efforts of four stalwart rowers				6921.205493700806
i did not wish to contradict them besides i might be deceived monsieur you insult the majesty of justice not at all said athos calmly				43.165840683794016

he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocket book and both began for the third time to count their gold and bank notes				7829.936556072563
the fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off				368.9065801906365
i can pass that is true said mousqueton glancing at his friend s long and thin body you will pass easily and he knows the full casks said blaisois for he has already been in the hold with monsieur le chevalier d artagnan				2.0616180430029027
what mean you by that they have eyes cried milady but they see not ears have they but they hear not yes yes said felton passing his hands over his brow covered with sweat as if to remove his last doubt				1212.9746762877824
alas speak to me more gently father in my last moments i need a friend do you suffer much asked the monk				786.3948429983175
i was obliged to sound a retreat toward the rue tiquetonne i was pursued and took refuge in the house next to this where i have been concealed between two mattresses				40178.62557999777
the challenge then continued beauchamp i took advantage of the silence and the darkness to leave the house without being seen				941.6865431535799
we even joked very pleasantly if i remember rightly on the very probable contingency of your being charged by the cardinal with my arrest				18755.49361915995
but did he know what was meant by the terrible word vendetta he knew so well that from that moment he shut himself in his house and never went out unattended seeking me high and low				722.6657296954861
constance replied the young man where are you				1377.9616939927027

the young men first approached the dead man				5.355783468062657
i say there for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there				211.37965197227146
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries				12048.760511756096
but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of paper on which spada had written i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst others my breviary with the gold corners which i beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle the heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid hands on the furniture and were greatly astonished that spada the rich man was really the most miserable of uncles no treasures unless they were those of science contained in the library and laboratories				26043.24871942026
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured villefort				1324.9390312027701
the two gentlemen traveled by byways in order not to encounter the mazarinists scattered about the isle of france and also to escape the frondeurs who were in possession of normandy and who never failed to conduct captives to the duc de longueville in order that he might ascertain whether they were friends or foes				1230.1636598919226
then it appeared to him that monte cristo smiled not with the strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of his heart but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child				731.4573331262152
through the closely fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the pavement that was all but true parisian as he was bonacieux could recognize every street by the milestones the signs and the lamps				24512.123315088633
he appears cool				1215.914726764964

what he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond worth five or six thousand livres which he wore on his finger and even this diamond supposing that d artagnan in his projects of ambition wished to keep it to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queen had not in the meanwhile since he could not part with it more value than the gravel he trod under his feet				174.72632320662217
he added that he did not know either m or mme				179.61119159428554

as for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when i have completed my affairs in paris i shall go and die in the east and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan ma foi said franz it would be the easiest thing in the world for i feel eagle s wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four and twenty hours ah yes the hashish is beginning its work				2185.40429363671

at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject				338.0318576176611
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation				947.7779591512763
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind				233.24853723645535

they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly				7606.61315717205
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination				51238.51961109657
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed d artagnan to porthos and went on his way				357.0287105505989

it was that of a man from five to eight and thirty in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries				76699.62159976996

you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger				197.17985231441685
heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured				69901.232612776
mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed				677.1287054371522
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent oh i take everything on myself				243.89934019132266

he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it				5.532196856006555
yes that is a great word sir				190.60989060799093
are we to pass the night in the king s room asked d artagnan				1.0361267335543862
bonacieux d artagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left half fainting upon an armchair				1488.8601492171108
he went toward the place where he had left him				7.460049245993166
but this is infamous cried he				12.965832260386245
under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend you will help me to recover my spirits to morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent				6693.825996282814
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went				663.383065992226
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time thank you sir it will be well employed i hope cromwell turned as he was going				310.83303564886074

eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d armilly her singing teacher				23130.718463328027
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars villefort complied and they passed on to the dining room				47.39308824134084
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables that is to say athos porthos and aramis				17.07267299104486
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results				1275.0462895350352
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter				809.1338353126176
really porthos you are a gifted individual i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera				1274.284706291964
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are				49.52300009698874
humph murmured athos it is certainly she and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady				209.80670152105233

men of the robe and men of the sword on the day after these events had taken place athos not having reappeared m de tréville was informed by d artagnan and porthos of the circumstance				1495.5100911631937
to delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh offense				117900.69715033683
but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of francs per annum paid quarterly				80540.11775002416
the people who wrote are anglo germans you know oh as for the composition of the letter there is nothing to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have doubts is it possible asked the count assuming all air and tone of the utmost simplicity and candor				13230.829411924718
only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest				124810.08846699269
he approached her				17.129574699693475

this man was the executioner				633.8436110386998
oh then you were glad to hear that m morrel i didn t dare to say maximilian had been made an officer of the legion of honor he signified assent only think of the poor old man s being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect stranger to him had been made an officer of the legion of honor				613.6083283968469
after the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires				69271.32268058951
i can not thus in a moment relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a father s untarnished name inspires a son				383.8440385570418

a letter from charles the first				273.44282959269685
in the first horseman she recognized d artagnan				1.0880342710958557
i own to you that that young man s visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep				1532.1085103492399

endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said				13.257643082812157

after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier				2632.0488311820113
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude				45243.75925422798
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his friend would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three years that he had travelled all over italy a similar piece of good fortune had never fallen to his share franz was by no means sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion				502.44598615699135
during the day i had nothing to fear				218.293068004491

in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant				10078.076640333844
nevertheless it was necessary to finish				9270.335872801666

owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet the pauses between the performances are very short the singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their costume when necessary while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps				736.2818875108669

paradise is at noisy le sec upon the site of the archbishop s chateau				3117.0295896273847
i do not recollect it said haydée				157.92201956502765
this idea while darkening his brow drew several sighs from him and caused him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance				313.073810834597
this miserable strain confines me to my bed but mousqueton forages and brings in provisions				20946.824050001454

well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome with pleasure there was a cry of shut up from the audience				1935.7805611850397
gentlemen he said the wood that i am carting is his i cut it in his copse and i am taking it to the chateau d artagnan determined not to question this man he did not wish to hear from another what he had himself said to planchet				324.4561086358276
friend said he for athos this is too much for the comte de la fère it is too little				1076.0183933615742
the bastion saint gervais on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends d artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber				55.96160510815648
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot				717.5830095740594
and yet it is difficult to suppose such a resemblance should exist between two jewels do you know this ring said d artagnan				1.037204742730396
soon as kitty left him d artagnan directed his steps toward the rue férou				1929.4330081388805
but the abbess on her part maintained a reserve still more prudent contenting herself with making a profound inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the name of his eminence				384.9586659112379
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer				174.5586053225602
let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen				848855.0776771334
when we show a friend a city one has already visited we feel the same pride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been				1356.7685172575077
within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you				25.671761340770644
yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle the poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while milady was reading with her lynx s eyes the very depths of his heart				33.43578940569079
then that person is a most amiable person albert looked around and perceived franz				249.79578176258886
her face is very pale and i have listened in vain i do not hear her breathe you are right said felton after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her				11.059025474263471
yes replied the narrator that was the name which the traveller gave to vampa as his own well and what may you have to say against this name inquired albert it is a very pretty name and the adventures of the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth i must confess franz said no more				801.698251595531
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression				545.398397882469
and clement vii but it will never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and napoleon was unable to complete his work				1052.3712913038273
my dear d artagnan said aramis don t be too angry with me i beg				2797.665514652054
she will remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the bourse then taking up his account book he cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away				85.28382745020066
the past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance				13480.993238698964
toward six o clock d artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night				303.49320181831735
the terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass				727.0976469120501
anne of austria opened the door to him herself				1258.5485430568713
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations				78764.94588032318
peppino placed himself beside ali and they set off at a rapid pace				434.4183404755566
he found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch patrol				63101.256200463686
the traveller descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his arms crossed				1361.3372436941809
i hid myself in the one nearest to the path villefort must take and scarcely was i there when amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans but you know or rather you do not know your excellency that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears				1369.0943675327642
madame de villefort wishes to remind you sir he said that eleven o clock has just struck and that the trial commences at twelve well said villefort what then madame de villefort is dressed she is quite ready and wishes to know if she is to accompany you sir where to to the palais what to do my mistress wishes much to be present at the trial ah said villefort with a startling accent does she wish that the servant drew back and said if you wish to go alone sir i will go and tell my mistress villefort remained silent for a moment and dented his pale cheeks with his nails				23581.060737699434
that s well				52.8508347517965
he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hour no change took place				236.55174362519458
as for you raoul i am sure it is your fault some giddiness or folly no sir i assure you muttered raoul it is not oh no no i declare it is not cried the young girl while raoul turned pale at the idea of his being perhaps the cause of her disaster				61744.24160021894
friend he cried i feel that i am dying thanks he made a last effort to extend his hand but it fell powerless beside him				4.418040166686565
bonacieux darting at her the most loving glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little person and while he descended the stairs he heard the door closed and double locked				3125.9244785687306
he received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge				9737.341859688308
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night there now				363.6351631011668
he stopped however at the door for an instant				930.4670679289687
this sleep provincial as it was brought him to nine o clock in the morning at which hour he rose in order to repair to the residence of m de tréville the third personage in the kingdom in the paternal estimation				7055.338481701421
a priest can understand a father s grief and m de villefort giving the key to d avrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work				842.9667454068924
that s ingenious said athos				3.3709611816325613
there is neither happiness nor misery in the world there is only the comparison of one state with another nothing more				870.8421031007683
a light cloud passed over the count s face				76.84538717907111
onward cried the gascon				24.718164205932197
go on count said morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours there is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome i have descended from a planet called grief i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning for instance you told me to live and i did live you told me to hope and i almost did so				21.858116458894518
good day said he				6.602435101052854
no my lord be assured we shall not d artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation				244.62998398003842
why did he detain her				31.378109088112566
on his side the prince sounded a rappel and all the officers of the royalist army mingling momentarily with the parisian troops ran to him				26.202525236226183
the officer reappeared				75.70832170176297
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man s eyes				116.23968798435479
see my lord said he in a deep gloomy tone here is a woman who was under my guard and who has killed herself be at ease felton said lord de winter				5.982510487833541
rumor will probably be busy respecting me my occupations my manner of living that will signify but little that concerns god you and myself mercédès said the count i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune amassed by m de morcerf half of it at least by right belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and economy i perceive what you are intending to propose to me but i can not accept it edmond my son would not permit it nothing shall be done without the full approbation of albert de morcerf				67.35757016667823
behold nebuchadnezzar exclaimed an old puritan soldier whose eyes flashed at the sight of the man they called the tyrant				95274.0567126328
julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawing room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the allées de meilhan				24.427457280438524
remain neutral monseigneur if you find that i act as becomes a gallant man young man said richelieu if i shall be able to say to you at another time what i have said to you today i promise you to do so this last expression of richelieu s conveyed a terrible doubt it alarmed d artagnan more than a menace would have done for it was a warning				4795.143735612553
treat her as one of your sisters				8360.335314775275
what the devil				5.113646284081671

he is alone said grimaud				32.05623251601506
i broke my word it is true but what signifies that				90.58511980108635
the day passed away in utter silence night came without recurrence of the noise				837.5637332690112
i am on my own ground and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall and to look over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character				267.738852243676
already dantès had visited this maritime bourse two or three times and seeing all these hardy free traders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds				26935.399594936924
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge				12705.824001462732
on opening the door villefort found himself facing him and the young magistrate s first impulse was to pause				2867.8940956686856
they will return said d artagnan				1.0494867575065858
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded				546.2822982468489
i embrace you with all my heart				32.00349475825947
but the glass cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies				17868.35844804095
to be decapitated				250.68773196560917
yes but he has been avenged				470.16011685718036
why did you not come down to breakfast				3267.098752934008
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act				2932.6553633682265
i warn you that i will never again work in the dark and that i will know not only to what i expose myself but for whom i expose myself an illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits you				11.0210567347628
yes if you really wish it said d artagnan and even with great pleasure i confess the journey has given me a devil of an appetite ah my poor friend said aramis you will find meagre fare you were not expected am i then threatened with the omelet of crevecoeur oh let us hope said aramis that with the help of god and of bazin we shall find something better than that in the larder of the worthy jesuit fathers				20580.34376221031
franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime				13630.449364373286
athos and d artagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the musketeer				1375.5386061611107
why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today because i am he who saved your father s life when he wished to destroy himself as you do today because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the pharaon to old morrel because i am the edmond dantès who nursed you a child on my knees morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo				1.068225618455054
but what s that to us				67.70747649529305
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction				14088.65836584845
i should think so but not without difficulty				1248.8008867525218
do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it i shall never forget it replied d artagnan				1.0333162532306797
however difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished him				10.240246125168749
the great man has called me his friend yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemnified				17850.883348878026
but i am grateful i swear to you but what does this note contain milady will tell you ah you do not love me cried kitty and i am very wretched to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women				1498.1638035849253
with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a labor saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre				53770.121037560755
peppino put out the torch peppino obeyed and franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall				92.40739151643531
that will do said milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you for monsieur de wardes said kitty				679.2708446693437
well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the lady s agitation revealed tell me what is the matter oh lucien can i confide in you of course you know you can do so				10.951370029409485
where are you taking me he asked				10.344942817791729
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and d artagnan more than anyone				546.4261063818511
in the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche				22.348060103455957
morrel called her and she ran to the gate				643.6496155885255
he found tréville in a joyful mood				986.2872110843161
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect				743.0133102379186
she stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of maximilian				1073.7462873623035
thank you no sir neither of those something connected with this story really				2093.6168656206473
good morning my dear host cried d artagnan				1.0387837895117078
the young man appeared on the threshold of the minister s closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter				275.2263266709041
and pray upon what shall i make my campaign upon grimaud i have brought you another said d artagnan				1.0344084514473488
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host				419.33617451477033
then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated				18328.13567938338
immediately replied d artagnan we have not a minute to lose hello grimaud				401.88778383758256
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library				13361.880203179278
diable when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father				244.81634284820151
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to paris is he he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling i understand well i am come to ask a favor of you of me yes of you and pray what may it be well to take his part ah my dear sir				57.71082229743224
it is well known how violent the king s prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men				296.74593617574084
d artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed quietly				1587.909945985352
felton arose				72.57522592513595
the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia				3070.7860039098678
yes and that s all settled exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail				58495.414398598165
it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it				9.98721972091296
he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german				16388.547942984234
and who is the assassin they asked together				637.3188918250927
old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m noirtier which she can not be when she becomes the baroness d épinay				117.5058447918394
at daybreak i left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion asleep				285.94388182975706
he he murmured she can it be he and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed				21429.151138917663
you are free you leave the count s house and you take your mother to your home but reflect albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her				34.22930020286251
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her				14.687607181703976
i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is planchet hesitated				1120.6109801015111
yes where at the louvre are you sure of it perfectly sure who told you of it madame de lannoy who is devoted to your eminence as you know why did she not let me know sooner whether by chance or mistrust the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all day well we are beaten				10938.563735995998
i am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me rochefort extended his hand to d artagnan who took it				6.4890614324110985
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count				11887.226734235495
i am inclined to think so and do you like him why he pleases me in spite of franz d épinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world the countess shuddered				447.20126345803027
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar				40727.63649721631
ah she cried what a frightful dream villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream				251.21149278725935
in that case replied the abbé he should be a man blessed of god rich happy caderousse smiled bitterly				10.333226532038216
my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty one				276.5273371895262
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain				1393.033769614258
who are you who are you said the voice				205.92279088340692
the decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the floor				168.1393420637823
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians d artagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans				14733.954326518511
oh miserable creature that i am cried she clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven				57.61667526756895
ah if i knew				407.3818056189363
be satisfied of that these two can not have drunk all the cellar				1054.6917049040503
everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder				5895.259539807682
i should affirm the culpability and i deny it said tréville				507.39123828494405

he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him				6.224750809991041
m noirtier being deprived of voice and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify yes and to wink when he means no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with m noirtier try noirtier gave valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary himself				58.11560383986716

a tear which appeared in the old man s eye expressed his thanks to the doctor				341.0375628458893
i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles that was no reason for staking my diamond replied d artagnan closing his hand with a nervous spasm				55239.554761930434
the queen bent over him and kissed his brow				144.72596699317882
at the barrière du trône they met bertuccio who was waiting there motionless as a sentinel at his post				811.8875141124777

he could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of athos				29.378989600641912
all that which a man wounded in his self love could let fall in the shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman porthos let fall upon the bowed head of the procurator s wife				94.11298790319135
the king was riding in front surrounded by troopers and when he saw athos and aramis a glow of pleasure lighted his pale cheeks				968.8382556633367
never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle				1310.3974983004387
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again				90.54685768902456
there was no family no servant the tall man alone inhabited this house				604.4251261042152

the carriage stopped near the meta sudans the door was opened and the young men eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a cicerone who appeared to have sprung up from the ground so unexpected was his appearance				675.8751550275119
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me and you you would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis				18.44449283882041

franz waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the captain returned with a mysterious air				155.86931100749214
who and what are you demanded villefort turning over a pile of papers containing information relative to the prisoner that a police agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an hour s time had swelled to voluminous proportions thanks to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim				13868.130920757827
then i shall also remain then rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man s head he slowly added by the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while you live faria gazed fondly on his noble minded single hearted high principled young friend and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose				385.8063721545114
alas do you not know what new calamity my daughter mademoiselle danglars eugénie has left us good heavens what are you telling me the truth my dear count				452.7621515051299

there are your instructions said mazarin go go				346.04854713695283
by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar				9679.900044617538
you have a charming young person with you tonight count said eugénie				99.88672640560635
oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular				99652.76753191983
the air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitic he was in prison				1367.2402668665234
i didn t understand it all he said but i understand now how droll it is you think so				12.305328936082244
suddenly a terrible cry a cry of despair was wafted through space and as if the shrieks of anguish had driven away the clouds the veil which hid the moon was cleated away and the gray sails and dark shrouds of the felucca were plainly visible beneath the silvery light				893.2534655339151
faria smiled				10.98993450410152
ali returned a sign in the negative				9595.836149608773
the cardinal therefore rose to open it				9.402367804636786
as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign				784.8203707300004
the cannonade of the isle of ré presaged to him the dragonnades of the cévennes the taking of la rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the edict of nantes				67160.68888640663

he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue she a poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will she might at that very moment perhaps be preparing to die				329.787989894741
in short continued the cardinal as i have heard nothing of you for some time past i wished to know what you were doing				1005.8761915652523
this child was the only heir to lord de winter if lord de winter did not marry				5927.381791575164

he however arrived without accident in the camp established before la rochelle on the tenth of the month of september of the year				1034.937906525988

did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter yes d avrigny reflected a moment then approaching noirtier pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation				1422.7744119677875
at that instant the little side gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared				267.7521300275812
very good said d artagnan and now in what direction did they set out that i am forbidden to tell d artagnan drew from his pocket a paper				1203.509981558961

mordaunt followed the carriage and when he had watched it drive beneath the sombre arches he went and stationed himself under a wall over which the shadow was extended and remained motionless amidst the moldings of jean goujon like a bas relievo representing an equestrian statue				694.5283053349168

before entering his closet the king desired to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived				138.08393025267327
the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard				88.80420325664379
d artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder				281.23689293877885

bazin remained at the window				61.531883620585475

the thing is simple enough				161.7510810204602
i am ready to speak my lord ah				56.62871504870233
signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear				2908.7622925702235
what can i do				54.90894509241749
the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day				141.61669067695925

then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it not at all ah that gives me more confidence this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascon s soul				2841.264369690801
the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him				5.257222684089869
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism				31542.490008971945
monsieur said the prince turning toward raoul i know that you have a letter from my sister madame de longueville but i see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel my lord said raoul coloring up i did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count				87.1770653412623
well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal				16.9690216727251
d artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it				8.212407606709288
the elder prisoner pondered the matter				406.54484568237916
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could				1768.8426639147754
that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights				10548.17475175469
what is this said aramis to juxon				3023.3941219210064
it was m de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers				5538.37959385392
i was chosen				95.09494852926186
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example				695.5033115209529
when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place				109.80846505335805

the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one				298.5031652567398

as it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo or the campo vaccino they wrote to signor pastrini the proprietor of the hôtel de londres piazza di spagna to reserve comfortable apartments for them				21.0432247919895
she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughter s innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof				29934.544213128363
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage				925.1245694605187
the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an ill bred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it				9.004657876770834
really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream				563.175052292641
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached raoul				252.08229265210488
d artagnan shows himself chapter x				755.5026067846475
adieu my noble and generous friend adieu i will go and tell valentine what you have done for me and slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the count s hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by monte cristo				1.058311103487495
now gentlemen a sortie cried athos				3.7717958683471373
do you see this firman i do said my father				39.4115403525751
d artagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends				65.28538238182689
and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbé and not from the good abbé himself and that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came it was i the comte de la fere said athos rising and bowing respectfully to the duchess de chevreuse				43.04763983114576
at one end was the receipted bill for the francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel nut with these words on a small slip of parchment julie s dowry				54155.47384947455
this chase was however advantageous to him in one sense for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead his heart began to cool				69309.38500779388
each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy				9047.940436274923
i will do my best well then let us go i must trust to you it is very fortunate said d artagnan to himself				49.832307131728015
you will find good cigars on the centre table				199.99743826685759
on their way they met grimaud				70.60743081059998

once outside he and planchet set off as fast as they could and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate				1235.4896410709528
i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but i conjure you do not abandon me				4.810860673506095
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened athos you are becoming mad no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur d herblay and myself to madame henrietta				2332.8157984109585
she has never been so kind before				414.1273733545708
well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related				1963.8115952945266
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head				33.15929218839811
scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair				172.62878728616496
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts				8583.443777470795
the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head				39.53439260373939
i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court				632.1240853364662
mazarin again				143.76488554325732
happily i vanquished death				379.04989544944823
i too would give up that good monsieur broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean did i say dead or alive replied mazarin				34.91025509135316
but d artagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it				44.19867709025568
oh were i not a foreigner				15859.24413357397
you will be very kind to me will you not morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus				1177.7196122328032
were you present during the last struggle asked m d avrigny				19.912649453913037
all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand				16593.92770680656
i think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality				9913.516760029906
it was seven o clock in the morning and daylight began to appear				1767.0874726030395
cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure				808.102411178169
do you not recollect morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess of the arabian nights if you like but tell me my dear lucien what it is that constitutes a princess				519.4759379674147
ah my friend said the abbé turning towards dantès and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass probably if ever i get out of prison true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty but wherefore are you here because in i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my cæsar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me				9.286062975339318
now my excellent signor pastrini said franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the count of monte cristo most assuredly replied he				997.6515737769645
not with us sir replied dantès				90.40741998739524
the idiot how so if he loved her asked d artagnan				1.0458315615604619
that would spoil my plans sir said the gardener glancing at the sun dial the ten minutes are almost up i must return to my post				1103.4184982590382
pray d artagnan said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that i shall have no head to converse with you				34.945396896348726
of course we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this man that i intended to ask shelter what was his name inquired the count who seemed to become somewhat interested in bertuccio s story				212.7546974332033
what is that asked d artagnan				1.0362540477025617
are you one of us monsieur de rochefort i am very desirous of being so my lord but i am totally in the dark about everything				224.02357017035604
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me				5.3245362101371985
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached				2611.0455846002988
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread				16603.362208577008
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold				3809.82827000621
you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor impostor repeated villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others				307.6606009843017
what do i see cried the lieutenant				56.73309546282327
i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote corner of the earth and shall be happy if you will accompany me viscount willingly then it is settled yes but where i have told you where the air is pure where every sound soothes where one is sure to be humbled however proud may be his nature				1456.1082971422811
the address to monsieur the baron danglars banker rue de la chaussée d antin caderousse wrote the address				2453.409467160524
you are quite upset				7530.364188962008
madame danglars did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart and restraining the tears which were ready to gush forth				10556.275777260445
but i forgot added the gascon smiling pardon i forgot you are no longer athos but never mind let us hear your plan for dinner porthos my plan yes have you a plan no				83.4320235682751
that is what i want come if you will only put this scheme into execution and be steady nothing could be better do you think so m bossuet				9529.263643369075
charles stuart you are our prisoner and both extended their hands as if to seize the king but before they could touch him with the tips of their fingers both had fallen one dead the other stunned				1907.6765589625036
hold sire said d artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute				30310.114733243463
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched				883.3048861322835
in the year i was transferred to piedmont in france				217.24697740629068
i have done and d artagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis				31.872979511227218
it was indeed for him that they were there				168.26839327695413
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence				18888.557023805013
although about forty four or forty five years old she might have passed for thirty five				4710.557253796108
but i doubt that your object was like theirs to rescue the holy sepulchre you are quite right beauchamp observed the young aristocrat				435030.51760015247
so now i have told my secret a telegraph repeated madame de villefort				3.9832913501234843
at the letter s the old man stopped her				16.384037927769217
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athos s compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it but said d artagnan it is the queen s diamond the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos				4.750311213378148
my dear la ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless compliments no my lord duke replied la ramee in the fullness of his heart i say what i think there is no compliment in what i say to you then you are attached to me asked the duke				10.450533028470716
this war may not only bring great catastrophes upon england and france but misfortune upon you my lord for which i should never console myself				199.68297725042822
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces				7666.784359565692
noirtier s eye remained immovable				260.37063430975627
it was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of arras				2801.213616730265
a door opened through which the attendant and the baron disappeared				414.1220416632568
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed				682.9342980014115
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honoré				88.11661082890643
diable resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel i confess i prefer the convent of noisy athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward de winter				16.25908297273062
mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry long live mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on porthos but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice be tranquil my lord and mazarin became more and more composed				17981.52403343978
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m andrea cavalcanti s solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration				2947.6044646889954
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done				56.134574425151285
and who has seen this fleur de lis inquired aramis				14.049793369912402
ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine together indeed replied villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well informed eh				3693.940039751337
ah that would indeed be infamous how did danglars usually write in a handsome running hand and how was the anonymous letter written backhanded again the abbé smiled				16.71884731789484
they arrived at the appointed spot				6523.628110771866
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed				5244.062487774921
the duke glanced at the clock				4367.577252368903
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happy				2060.7632820948056
ah fie d artagnan replied				107.45729425130263
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vain they opened again as soon as shut				1761.0109084096498
gentlemen return your swords to their scabbards well provided you replace your pistols in your belt willingly and d artagnan set the example				915.7248859520596
you see your friends are wakeful				100702.61280965577
you will soon know but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation dantès trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent				270.48144861347737
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over				154.8172498413388
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpent like embraces				4141.74584932833
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers the soldier s throat				984.5599084957101
no for your skill with the sword is so well known ah who has betrayed me the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered and you failed they positively refused morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol never well we have time look monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercédès entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club				17124.90487338845
yes said the baron assassinated				310.78887019789903
ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father				106.16902363908383
it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away				165.14705492826266
i did hope man is a poor wretched creature i did hope				345.0985776866089
go sir then said the queen you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court your majesty answered mazarin desires me to do only what i was going to ask you to let me do				88.09531064566923
there was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti				4837.123700319049
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also				293.2150491001669
chapter xxxii				46.62512143656472
did she stay long there an hour and a half did she return home directly well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening				77.41013815168115
he applied his imitative powers to everything and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees				590.6860829363873
listen said he i have not the strength of mind you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my daughter valentine your daughter madeleine were concerned the doctor turned pale				109.75041232533958
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered port wine ah				131.99271035421648
soon he saw the lights of la consigne				1412.9623232416805
the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of richelieu the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austria to declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter				187.38472074162874
the night passed in perfect silence				300.6119058893391
albert entered				25.012819787981865
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses				28771.76850845939
there was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression				2645.2133226880487
then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse				4325.817482477967
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream				221.27482465649572
bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into lorraine or belgium				3893.293314228983
a carriage waits your orders and ali and myrtho will accompany you whithersoever you desire to go				485.1701919407515
yes my lord how much were they worth why said porthos that was very good of him it seems to me a thousand pistoles i said a thousand pistoles porthos exclaimed				145.99174393460635

you say you were on the point of being made captain of the pharaon yes and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl yes now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things				836.1945756026039

the president himself advanced to place a seat for the young lady but she declined availing herself of it				14.585758459936958
if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter				786.3824686803653
thank you viscount continued the prince laughing and i appoint you from this moment my interpreter but the prisoner was not less unwilling to respond in italian than in the other languages his aim was to elude the examination				4229.47239433802

the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing				10930.899029539563
now whither do you conduct me into my room first replied comminges the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile athos followed comminges without saying a single word				216.22280806127677

the vicar himself awaited him conducted him to the top of the tower and when there pointed to a little door placed the light which he had brought with him in a corner of the wall that the coadjutor might be able to find it on his return and went down again				138.8046846542559
i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity				48572.34579374782
it may still be possible to overtake the prisoner				137.52631084437905
although athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress				932.9145212541757
this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was				116.37811714281797
that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the banker s house				130.4795845098126

they knew the count s energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself				50.5016561209834
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawing room with her little edward				13693.327168548314
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile				187.16629316076015
listen said morrel it is not the first time you have contemplated our present position which is a serious and urgent one i do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret				1982.5000360838833
relate what has passed during the night since these gentlemen desire to know it have you not taken a bastion said a swiss who was drinking rum out of a beer glass				733.2218739064236
he sighed and set to work again				112.03592941797757
if it were as you pretend it is said he i should be forced my dear aramis to reclaim it myself for as you very well know bois tracy is an intimate friend of mine and i can not allow the property of his wife to be sported as a trophy you make the demand badly replied aramis and while acknowledging the justice of your reclamation i refuse it on account of the form the fact is hazarded d artagnan timidly i did not see the handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis				92.75544021439919
that is enough to drive away all my pains i could mount him with thirty balls in my body				361.60985144684327
but i know you my lad said athos appearing on the threshold				128.3755515648185
at last about ten o clock and just as dantès began to despair steps were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment				189.86378542010266
i did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange the letter signed sinbad the sailor is it not exactly so				11.384134748827229
i know well that the proposition is tempting but at present it is impossible to accept it and why not said aramis in his tone of raillery				154250.3140651359
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature				139348.3628750661
a name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way				297.3833675209177
no monseigneur				24.393876136893358
now do you want a horse or will you go afoot afoot my lord i have served always in the infantry				56691.37432597708
i was so bewildered by your departure and so overcome with grief at our separation that i am sure i was able to but very feebly express all the affection and gratitude i feel toward you				13.967331438917228
follow us planchet we shall continue our conversation to the end of the village they traversed the width of the village talking of indifferent things then as they reached the last houses go then dear friend said aramis follow your own career				1480.0771742954203
i swear he said with a calm brow and kindly glance but in a voice still trembling with recent emotion i swear that i no longer bear animosity to those who were once my friends				41.30583489871092
she traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage				3297.9208909969766
it often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole life				527.1861997277144
i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage feast this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder dantès who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moment s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom				79685.19439313434
it appeared then to d artagnan that m bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon				2058.6516704013907
in the morning as he was mounting his horse d artagnan who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke took planchet aside				934.8939690078514
our friend will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be concealed				2253.879966508509
the feast had been made ready on the second floor at la réserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar				3750.5656272680944
about five minutes replied the captain				56.93814394393235

oh said valentine we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear m d avrigny				21.941579327789253
he was induced to undertake this journey of which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to andrea either by the arrival of bertuccio from normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop				1589.3984910746071
then she broke the silence to cry out you are cowards miserable assassins ten men combined to murder one woman				516.168989930737
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step				359.803528518514
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy				1525.959287725688
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him				7.156058953841281
from the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect				6550.747486134724
at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions				1535.8550441041925
morrel whispered what have you done to him i				355.2296875367633
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saint remy				124.14724903002293
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor				5285.403878648565
the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends				98.72974272024099
have you not let it go out of your hands no d avrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them				28.077835358776408
four of them can guard the king and the other four your prisoners				37611.41184770179
blaisois found bazin donning his beadle s gown his services being required that day at notre dame				37.8275640281003
she was seated				50.78224266198239
accused said the president your name and surname andrea arose				561.7557153863037
this time the poor girl did not even argue with d artagnan she gave it to him at once				57.87393534940858
franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw albert disappear arm in arm with the peasant girl				499.75930219996627
ah said the marquise de saint méran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed am i not right villefort i beg your pardon madame				311.5179576347671
the inquiry m de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil				2798.728939317059
along the isle of dogs and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another				216.6000816408714
ah good evening my dear m caderousse said monte cristo what are you doing here at such an hour the abbé busoni exclaimed caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied				4681.456306982448
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him				7.849767648940012
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction an admirable subject cried the jesuit				758.3586634794374
villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination				3921.84974443822
i am for those who save the state said bonacieux emphatically				1021.2429954533847
well what is it what is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out				50.24849041471011
the whole assembly manifested great surprise but andrea appeared quite unmoved				307.74335317108927
d artagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word				559.8600191346859
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude				1796.201046687558
i actually love no one sir you know it do you not				22.10769654727366
the signatures were perfectly legal				2849.627767737605
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive us well it will be the worse for you				22.725880842382843
she told d artagnan that lord de winter was her brother in law and not her brother				172.1355161324563
gentlemen said athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together				1200.5140549085559
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain clear				2498.501106884344
you are in prison then rochefort trembled in every limb at this question				193.87587078160206
but i think i have it said athos				4.0757165927807115
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day				551.0028169489179
i will swear to you by my soul s salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth				398.2836728975857
one of the noble peers who was familiar with the arabic language having studied it during the famous egyptian campaign followed with his eye as the translator read aloud i el kobbir a slave merchant and purveyor of the harem of his highness acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor from the french lord the count of monte cristo an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand francs as the ransom of a young christian slave of eleven years of age named haydée the acknowledged daughter of the late lord ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his favorite she having been sold to me seven years previously with her mother who had died on arriving at constantinople by a french colonel in the service of the vizier ali tepelini named fernand mondego				10409.76644107837
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation they are hot royalists said groslow				360.06337578895165
i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of roman crowns about francs				369.0068615863635
is anyone ill in the house the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets				16625.87785976048
dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently				29274.175421441545
at nine o clock madame la première présidente arrived				137.91580242270177
it was mousqueton				820.0727242574488
it is well madame i believe your oath no no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read i command you for i am resolved that everything shall be finished to night and never will i recur to this subject again				158.5909943676038
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids see our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun the count bowed but stepped back				254.67203925636161
d artagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head				13.594254959123596
all this she owes to d artagnan without doubt				1076.6188709459157
it is over aramis had said				11.414062670810742
m de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court				420.00796121930983
two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the island of elba				124955.62568515833
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will				651.9408036579399
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady again				78.12217778106604
we are first said morrel looking out of the window				34.815963673336704
and grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension				253025.86264771456
who is there answered the voice of her he sought				5569.603552910725
as he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely white				37906.98021709726
you know that it was in leaving his house that m de caderousse was murdered by his friend benedetto				1148.7428335929046
good bye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man				1.9465379824201166
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men what are your commands lieutenant take the detachment and conduct him to his place but you will be left alone certainly				3630.07334734371
aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan who was saying to him you swear sir that it is not so stop and aramis gave him a louis d or				228.77811626878812
you will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will speak i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself it is more time than i require				1805.9021220072937
the same flower of innocence had flourished or was still flourishing on their brow that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house villefort shrieked clasped his hands and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air				139.25674994374535
with a word d artagnan reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palais cardinal				185.91956618524128
i therefore may hesitate between you				10.765412857365575
do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said d artagnan to the youth				4447.3025565173375
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step				513.6927422496852
if i had wished to widen the breach between those whom monsieur d herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder i could have spoken out what are you meddling with cried aramis pale with anger suspecting that d artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with madame de longueville				361.9641941389385
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it				7.198572015497652
it followed that d artagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friends athos porthos and aramis				15.05308776878707
the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man s face				58.620250456944774
let him come yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come moreover he is but a child said aramis				17.54786933412825
do not call anyone do not be alarmed said the count do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the man standing before you valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of valentine could not reply the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here the count s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl s mind				124.01625376974418
go on my child said the count in the romaic language				1128.567765064907
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment d artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity				80671.49143161894
with one word you have crushed it and i die but the duel will not take place edmond since you forgive it will take place said monte cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your son s blood to stain the ground mine will flow mercédès shrieked and sprang towards monte cristo but suddenly stopping edmond said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again i trust to him from my heart				34.269295644816
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all he will play me some dog s trick or other and that immediately said tréville				336.410678857939
at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared				18685.81185715382
i don t comprehend you don t comprehend that i want you and your three friends to be of use to me which of my friends my lord your three friends the friends of former days of former days my lord				52.290153837925104
but should you find the means of retaining them remember my lord that i shall esteem you as having rendered the greatest service that a gentleman can render to a queen and in the day of my prosperity he who brings me this order and this cross shall be blessed by me and my children madame replied de winter your majesty will be served by a man devoted to you				27.52238899756285
byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them				14.925588334005573
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that d artagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois				756.0943717382454
he was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected humility				682.3356929998275
i have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron s heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some manfred some lara some werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society you say i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag				4317.068073866602
now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed albert stepped back and morrel closed the door				19.072816892735613
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third rate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone				435.0671940679361
bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits				266829.13395384944
he will explain to you the steps that i expect you to pursue				51996.690751285525
i your son as you call me i will not let you twas the first time d artagnan had ever refused a request from athos				29.890004248194728
all the other guests followed				748.0767280977387
now at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused				250.752649083059
a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in				430.8843684528195
no by your eminence by me				9.118688202948068
the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of de luynes				158.96872203778878
what could explain athos s having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table				111.06582706239655
monsieur said mademoiselle d aubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voiture s friends				47.29397206225103
i feel cramps over my whole body do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes yes any noise in the ears frightful when did you first feel that just now suddenly yes like a clap of thunder did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before nothing no drowsiness none what have you eaten today i have eaten nothing i only drank a glass of my master s lemonade that s all and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him				6.3371173194405435
four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich where a vessel was waiting and knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and inactive tranquil yes replied cromwell				216.76405374447577
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner s feverish imagination				3541.727767480595
it seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse and was becoming as mad as those he saw				5464.508772613258
her reputation would be lost it is true but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer				4768.693523764808
what do you wish to say about it i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified to what do you refer				37858.641142188164
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort and then my lord continued rochefort you understand that to emerge from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change one s prison say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said mazarin				42.48606013867532
i love you you permit me to tell you that i do that is already more happiness than i dared to hope silence said mme				28.022194173414267
that is to say athos will be chief engineer porthos purveyor in general and aramis governor of the fortress meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau				1774.7939141313357
it is eleven o clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king charles i				11.195253703767257
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthy that of being the husband of mercédès nay nay cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet				2796.5584881080354
your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon you beware athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile				80.0909207310273
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow				855.8390629301138
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman chatillon and flamarens started				92.00346756313816
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face				81.93386515024714
stay where you are i will go myself and with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground d artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier				1514.1773155367473
in two bounds he was at the louvre as he entered the wicket of l echelle ten o clock struck				267.4173225219061
ah ah cried he seizing my arm and wresting from me the weapon that had so badly served me you want to take my life do you my pretty puritan				37352.614490853586
i do not understand you so much the better i have a ray of hope left listen i am all attention said eugénie looking so earnestly at her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze				3535.2958048880087
d artagnan returned				85.05031535675909
so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character				551.2690354597315
some of that at the bottom near the laths				62819.471671030726
the trial chapter				1.1312049602905894
my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god				1671.0850230073927
only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas what are they sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment				827.4395931289297
ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven o clock then you have received full information concerning my arrival of course ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my coming oh no it has not but you are sure you are not mistaken very sure it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o clock this evening i will prove it to you beyond a doubt oh no never mind that said the italian it is not worth the trouble yes yes said monte cristo				1.0498452195791241
ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents civil war like a forest flame but we we shall remain i have a presentiment that we shall yes replied d artagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion st gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleurs de lis embroidered be it so cried aramis				23.0735599761522
it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing room				43.813230447965594
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders				69.07588275099212
the boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cable s length of shore				11767.541274418849
i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done you will give me your advice will you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position				750.4640708242475
in what in a pate for example in a pate said la ramee				17.971998830733586
my very self dear friend me also repeated porthos				14.961940289439795
this traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands they set out on vulcan and bayard followed by mousqueton on phoebus and arrived at the palais royal at about a quarter to seven				3500.9394604208783
you know i used to be a good cook do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers				3486.2032437046255
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work				1106.6274144821646
speak speak take this letter said d artagnan				1.0281690353094706
with a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride				777.0307368801159
what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you eh parbleu they should kill me the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words				540.7754002278023
i carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one no said lord de winter we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england oh very well replied aramis then bending his face down to athos s ear what is the object of this visit continued he				48.57983432722164
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing				168.03322375133868
at two o clock the tennis balls began according to grimaud s directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of la ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over				217.34199152023092
the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which monte cristo excelled				1125.5050511856946
i have eight men on guard you know				111.71776789430318
forsooth i don t know half a pistole if you can find out said d artagnan				1.0268980268646688

the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves				47017.76340561436

he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen				5898.6450504279455
but how				175.67092141585857
soon the two gentlemen stopped also				2107.8289699775914
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen				951.4370973256356
at what time six o clock where at saint mande who told you the count de rochefort some one drew near				1767.9488329223552
oh death is in my house cried villefort				44.17296183874588
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door				79.50816632040598
it is too late				559.3618227615067
what is your name in your turn if you please d artagnan to yours monsieur and above all others cried d artagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the cardinal the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of d artagnan if the wine had been bad but the wine was good and he was convinced				1592.0548190143386

the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on				56.960085550523836
but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queen s manner				403.7120612981859

she only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm the fair round arm of a woman but twenty five years old and who yet spread death around her				11.870391424082506
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father s mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank				1687.0657874423378
moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe				18052.400988961563
their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived				160.83262489365214
where are you asked the valet de chambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom				3189.986333565904

as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life				584.390386260445
grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring				1752.216767514996
i do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions				30305.114411560407
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers				596.5894286989001
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms				352.6612905789228

who has consoled me in my sorrow but he				252.73607736891248
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied me				17.354106173141854

as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief				2962.1410173976565
i was about to give it when you anticipated me that then is your opinion asked aramis				20.61466846712894

milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone				504.201850324871
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and d artagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a sensation				34313.64405244298
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound sense				22120.81652288486
we must ask the comte de la fere the question				84.63438819855052
stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the ironsides this was the name given the cuirassiers whom cromwell had made his body guard				549.358167949328
d artagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey				245.42179067472128
but perhaps you have never loved child replied the count				6.402314282186261
it is no nonsense it is quite true				208.86540796193123
but since the end of the month m morrel had passed many an anxious hour				574.6576933290099
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe				16199.500250289322
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them it was past midnight the next thing was to find planchet				758.5973660081999
you see said he calling d artagnan s attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour s walk we have made a tour of my domains all is charming and everything savors of nobility replied d artagnan				1.0251890418693852
in a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time oh i also swear it monte cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his heart				31.498583885531183
i want to go into master broussel s house captain replied friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of paris know so well how to assume when necessary				2436.363024240694
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend				1754.5812177788748
well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to france with us friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable then you have some other motive unknown to us athos smiled and d artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head				23.802781111902288
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task				3575.5328995692994
i will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but i will arrive before they do mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league distant				14332.976667653404
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you heyday cried d artagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell who s an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman				5635.439002877831
i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden				264.52674761086666
d artagnan looked much disconcerted				13789.726721520772
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret				3948.0959086811004
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them				28.848016400356084
i have them at hand monsieur porthos take yours from your holsters i have them good said d artagnan seizing his own now you understand porthos not too well we are out on the king s service well for the king s service we need horses that is true said porthos				11.359251155204044
the troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings				44021.62274714896
grimaud had a stout short picard cob which cost three hundred livres				276.7357521350772
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner				17917.229421600834
excuse me mr president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i can not follow you				9.603829931756538
on entering the hotel d artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire				734.0299582488057
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m bazin				589.1895450186304
your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom i had the honor to speak to you planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses				8408.382834269445
but never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad effects and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit				22039.493412219468
yes but the contract the same smile returned				1001.4048904553433
he had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals				3508.5433762066755
come now i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past with all my heart replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten				384.4235860345549
but don t think yourselves in a better position than you are				72.90285683756092
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to milady to be silent his face was much agitated				2906.803113262388
he then motioned to his wife to take leave				1008.5407525240579
they are destined to produce at least ten				825.82980278491
this time he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him				3.9278986061646406
i have told you that i am prepared for anything the two travelers knocked at the door				12.483959497844888
d artagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money				212.14535389095136
the devil said porthos				12.713810538323466
may you not have been philandering a little also monsieur bonacieux				42.00794521917876
there s one just arrived and she handed the letter to d artagnan				1.0536947256320228
oh yes scoundrel cried milady seeing the interest which the young officer whose soul seemed to hang on her lips took in this strange recital				2235.350760943684
albert could not understand the banker s look and turning to monte cristo who understood it perfectly did you see said he how he looked at me yes said the count but did you think there was anything particular in his look indeed i did and what does he mean by his news from greece how can i tell you because i imagine you have correspondents in that country monte cristo smiled significantly				2299.855421241848
at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times				1176.397832504922
d artagnan knelt as well as the rest received his share of the benediction and made the sign of the cross but when bazin passed in his turn with his eyes raised to heaven and walking in all humility the very last d artagnan pulled him by the hem of his robe				6719.922351822431
dantès you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier s eyes				70.17859287332084
the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dantès plate and dantès after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day				181.4976895254537
go to the parliament for it was from this parliament the enemy of monarchs that the daughter of the great the sublime henry iv whom you so much admire received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold and with these words henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal raising his hands clasped toward her exclaimed ah madame madame how little you know me mon dieu but queen henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions crossed the cabinet opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinal s numerous guards courtiers eager to pay homage the luxurious show of a competing royalty she went and took the hand of de winter who stood apart in isolation				520113.47706247546
it is the hotel rambouillet cried guitant				446.48470469956715
his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the window				44.96416164669652
it was like a besieged town				14564.84022828137
then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played drank sang but that whilst playing drinking singing he often stopped short to vow that mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at vincennes				2367.8219415169146
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being king s attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and that s rather against him well well returned m morrel we shall see				204.863874888606
the count alone seemed unmoved nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks				922.8414361995751
yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only the young girl made a gesture of rage				206.86759143920202

what is the use of one horse for us two				361.3559526865942
a thousand francs but whence have you obtained them listen to me mother and do not yield too much to agitation and albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at her				14.130915993593344
i want recommendations and some information relative to africa				51861.83804867118
nevertheless it is necessary that my will should be respected in my family and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of a child should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many years				411.6172521173499
have you any money the four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful				89303.54698038142
now to supper said aramis				16.39110978241242
athos is not a man to be thwarted he like porthos has obliged his peasantry to call him my lord and to dignify his pettifogging place by the name of chateau				19209.461556059927
a little better sir will you drink some of this ether and water i will try but don t touch me why not because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your finger the fit would return drink barrois took the glass and raising it to his purple lips took about half of the liquid offered him				9.149228314318774
no sir i ask as your unfortunate companion appeared to me to belong to the church he is the curate of bethune sir and was carrying the holy vessels belonging to his church and the treasure of the chapter to a safe place the prince having abandoned our town yesterday and as it was known that bands of the enemy were prowling about the country no one dared to accompany the good man so i offered to do so				16.41208540971898
but for the honor of the king of the queen well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen				9.782807765355235

i could interpret one of your looks then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown instantly but on my part said milady how should i repay such a service				670.3248409300036

all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard				62152.65077357771
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot				753.393400697104

he never spoke to him except under the most extraordinary occasions				5797.887295907124
then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn				301.9321179478465
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world				61.81057455163768
with anne of austria for that affair was over but he had to adjust matters for m de bassompierre who was embroiled with the duc d angoulême				15.029455252197167

his granddaughter				16.34403596623556
dear grandfather said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no friend in the world but you his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness				1792.9638452104496
villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him				6.646403428308782
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served				4824.394646941986
it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de villefort was it ali asked the count of morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits no count replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debt if indeed there existed one and i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject				293.67176329374064

thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition				1764.6834493312806
and no one thinks of us in this country for each must think about his own affairs				1516.8258178046867
he started on seeing the cavalier with the curate				10960.377545011936
you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day and yet i was not aware that you had married fernand my calumniator and that my father had died of hunger can it be cried mercédès shuddering				2361.6585052263417

it appeared to her that the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves				11794.494637597554
m d épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history				751.5896339475819
during that time he had many moments of despair				452.63824541139286
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew				377.53341324925003

felton cried she				19.349092723472385

do not fancy that i do you a favor i use either hand easily				2843.690533521308
at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats				78634.65220591846
oh pray for mercy s sake don t fly from me				6.236887693056561

i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another				259.45536659201156
he fixed his eyes upon d artagnan even more earnestly than before				219.37201884599241
they will no doubt bleed him therefore i will retire for i can not endure the sight of blood and she followed her husband upstairs				3933.303870189997
at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop				905.9752032505002
let him be conquered exiled proscribed provided he still lives				18855.261370501437

yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone				95.39201192720934
gaetano skirted the light carefully keeping the boat in the shadow then when they were opposite the fire he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his companions sung the chorus				1292.6907310316653
if i were i should do for you at once the most that you deserve				859.1244029034061
i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment you are then a chemist somewhat i know lavoisier and was the intimate friend of cabanis but for such a work you must have needed books had you any i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome but after reading them over many times i found out that with one hundred and fifty well chosen books a man possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a man need really know				234.75934922584753
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures				3977.1832613716233
it was plain that it was not the chance combination of those who had collected a number of the malcontents at the same spot but a concerted organized attack				12951.334167050767
the first four furloughs granted as may be imagined were to our four friends				581.9583091136866

m de villefort entered his father s room followed by madame de villefort				3.2315678887392965
the king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh athos did not reply he reflected				362.0156319908023
excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth				272.61611992163137
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head				2391.035674844648
a part of the good abbé s words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home				406.6026187822791

these francs will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man and i shall therefore act according to my conscience having said this villefort quitted the room with his wife leaving his father at liberty to do as he pleased				1484.7042694161676
he had made up his mind to write to her the next day				165.16453796562809

he thought that there had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom faria offered the treasures				9266.552747773316
he replied he replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what to poison indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness				1369.9485421490353

they have some capital wine here please to observe that in passing				75673.28344935468
caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect				18108.906434431774
excuse my little subterfuge said the countess in reply to her companion s half reproachful observation on the subject but that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled mind franz essayed to smile				5050.828207844446
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so everything answered franz your voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead i i live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha				25168.595340100164

aramis you think that d artagnan that porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy among friends my dear athos no you are right but among enemies it would be only a stratagem athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head				242.02576548925327
you tell me he burned the letter he did saying at the same time you see i thus destroy the only proof existing against you this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural you think so i am sure of it				9.544469673642068
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages				59689.99109397285
in the meantime d artagnan was defiling with his company				1238.9892918457053
what is life to you nothing				109.65944283045968
she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good bye to you in full dress noirtier again closed his left eye				320.16973601416595

this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds				921.9072535837787

he felt that in returning to camp he should re enter slavery nevertheless he did return				1878.932027923906
in that case his last hope would have been destroyed				1299.7430564111405

do you agree with aramis not at all said d artagnan i am precisely of the contrary opinion what				125.2795114742458
as to m de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past				2010.6706120041958
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him no sire where did he lodge rue de la harpe				820.8653564302499
does anyone dare to slander me monsieur i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation then sir i am patiently to submit to your refusal yes sir although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for i had reckoned on the honor of your alliance and the breaking off of a marriage contract always injures the lady more than the gentleman enough sir said morcerf we will speak no more on the subject and clutching his gloves in anger he left the apartment				139.17277573984634
both were in shadow and the sybil of cuma herself could not have read them				35.76937823139037

albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros				32481.18541195776
in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio whose servant he had been another the illustrious mazarin acting the part of ignatius loyola in a tragedy of that name a third the illustrious mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny who had expected to have it a fourth the illustrious coxcomb mazarin refusing to give laporte the young king s valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner				629.6287425901145
you see that everything is to our advantage yes said d artagnan but we shall indubitably attract a ball well my dear replied athos you know well that the balls most to be dreaded are not from the enemy but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our muskets you are stupid friend porthos				127.26912512553046

ali having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eyes and feigned to sleep				158.11596871122688
the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the air that could only enter by the newly formed opening had the mephitic smell dantès was surprised not to find in the outer cavern				1104.8742650814074
so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet				90949.98973717427
for heaven s sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heaven s sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch				2480.6315005457395
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned edmond dantès who either carries the letter for paris about with him or has it at his father s abode				1252.918818415411
but by what means				2012.9220871188313
she saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan				1605.4521930229027
a short time ago while making researches in the royal library for my history of louis xiv i stumbled by chance upon the memoirs of m d artagnan printed as were most of the works of that period in which authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence more or less long in the bastille at amsterdam by pierre rouge				2003.9351073912312
his signal was returned and in two hours afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht				2391.3959845412046

it was the fault of that blockhead pastrini that i did not sooner assist you in your distress				1689.3777668249245
life for life man for man give me one i will give you the other i don t know what you mean nor do i even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal but i wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creature the more so as you tell me this d artagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal				16.531006017445304
ay said he i see but you shall not kill me today				1084.6894001231694
then a singular thing occurred				9292.712583582645
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect your very humble and obedient servant godeau purveyor of the musketeers that s all well cried d artagnan				1.034273742846466

if bonacieux knew where his wife was one might by extreme means force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret escape				528.547427786934
where is the count friend				118.28444444423074
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity				7503.724910252553
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner and the result of the sitting was that the procurator s wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory				16181.38865002425
take notice captain he continued giving planchet his expected title take notice that one of the three men who just now went out from here told me privately to distrust these gentlemen and i said planchet with dignity i know them and i answer for them as he said this he pressed grimaud s hand who seemed honored by the distinction				7310.298697880312
a little sooner or a little later it isn t worth quarreling over if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened oh it will happen you may be sure said d artagnan				219.67872490972766
it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least ah				783.4784024503542
no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon but you have seen him sire i went straight to the duc de blacas but you will see him then i think not sire ah i forgot said louis smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive i forgot you and m noirtier are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have nothing more to ask for never mind sir we will not forget you make your mind easy				1079.1383633697212
he was no				152.64067995051428
this is what had happened andrea had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his foot slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended				5203.094081474887
then give me that letter madame said the chancellor				3062.7577027378143

i am as certain of it as that we two are christians the abbé with a shaking hand seized a glass of water that was standing by him half full swallowed it at one gulp and then resumed his seat with red eyes and pale cheeks				2831.7545776353895
count he inquired have you any relations no sir i am alone in the world so much the worse why asked monte cristo				1.0537666085205784
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point				953.8341842434997
stop sir look yonder he whispered don t you see in the darkness something pass by like shadows				14616.533519982715
richelieu remained standing leaning against the mantelpiece a table was between him and d artagnan				1.0780192577367371
i do not like to have simple soldiers because they have the advantage of serving in a privileged corps thus to play the great lords discipline is the same for them as for everybody else athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely and bowed in sign of assent				664.615982540297
have you been long in the orangery he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury				147608.94842415414
each had his own particular visit to make				986.6197680999909
and as continued he the duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family we mean to make the journey together				471.01236125693805
you will appear at this ball yes with those studs yes the queen s paleness if possible increased the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character				388.13577320427925
the circumstances that had hastened the return of d artagnan to paris were as follows one evening when mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolf like step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink				89938.7528192756
my weapons what weapons my military weapons yes my lord at any rate i think so make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up				418.4285623162236

vampa was twelve and teresa eleven				3493.1154943566326
although i am very much afraid that your good wishes will not be of great service to me bah said athos god is great as say the followers of mohammed and the future is in his hands then swallowing the contents of his glass which he put down close to him athos arose carelessly took the musket next to him and drew near to one of the loopholes				13704.353379874174
i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue				420.2800232928014
a moment cried d artagnan making them a sign to replace in the scabbard their half drawn swords				1210.2096513495205
the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to d artagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed				421.5886980196932
the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison				811.98353004706

meanwhile the cardinal returned to his own room and after asking bernouin who stood at the door whether anything had occurred during his absence and being answered in the negative he desired that he might be left alone				129.0572617063294
these four men were not princes neither were they dukes neither were they men in power they were not even rich				1369.9910035610972

never fear said aramis				13.250188690676383
the first thing that met his eye was the meridian drawn by the abbé on the wall by which he calculated the time then he saw the remains of the bed on which the poor prisoner had died				902.0090538095476
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons				4669.978559418607
when left alone with bernouin mazarin was for some minutes lost in thought				2040.4115972283064

dantès uttered a cry of joy and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success				7595.703369781643

what cried aramis and athos what				385.4926523899666
dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade				450.9200170677792
oh am i happy enough for that yes you have called haydée your sister let her become so indeed valentine render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me protect her for the count s voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world alone in the world repeated a voice behind the count and why monte cristo turned around haydée was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement				521.3029985327718
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness what do you say edmond i say since you command me mercédès i must die die				210.55194641296978
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him				4.116900500334496

at the corner of the street they met the count s steward who was awaiting his master				612.8729024654094
yes monsieur said d artagnan bowing we have had that honor				1650.8399490131203
m de morcerf will accompany me bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six o clock				4.654297072570846
to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them				10.966665553944239
was it the englishman who carried off crowns from here the other day no he really had crowns and we found them				15.639920776966601

i trust your majesty will pardon this intrusion on her meditations but a foreign lord has arrived from england and waits in the parlor demanding the honor of presenting a letter to your majesty oh a letter				214.31030002525202
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart oh				1676.2325233208644
from that moment she watched all his actions all his words from the simplest glance of his eyes to his gestures even to a breath that could be interpreted as a sigh				1091.5158577821348
grimaud bazin mousqueton and planchet				116.99438812842608
when he arrives i will not fail to do so just then a handsome young man with bright eyes black hair and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to madame de villefort				4.995291813371982
in paris yes athos and aramis looked at each other				40.80772348482214
have you seen alas did you recognize valentine groaned				33316.65287585722
die in peace i am lost murmured milady in english				3686.9925430436897
bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this bag the cardinal s cried d artagnan breaking into a loud laugh he having heard as may be remembered thanks to the broken boards every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife				120.72626327798042
yes sir who is it a woman accompanied by a servant everyone looked at his neighbor				1614.7327525271426
it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven on the contrary we are all free agents alas exclaimed mercédès if it were so if i possessed free will but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair monte cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her grief				2311.004649265075
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard				10014.698655439865
cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed seized his rapier and returned toward d artagnan but on his way he met athos who during his relief which d artagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that d artagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight				475.8297124804673
courage cried raoul courage too late murmured the young man too late the water closed above his head and stifled his voice				106.95295131828385
he passes for a very charitable man				74.15412281352135
she is young she is beautiful she possesses all earthly seductions				3819.122760934896
then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar				46816.81923635022
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair a head like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him				4.192400802988818
we might say that was his dream				408.2181527677067
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dantès if only to prevent your growing weary of me				48.693810593412735
in our position one must provide for everything i shall try to gain the coast of france				137.1677414411927
yes count you know what i told you all remains the same then in that quarter it is more than ever a settled thing said lucien and considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures				4664.348103544856
near paris is it not very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil at auteuil said villefort true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken				74.48106765480897
they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message				9949.451216993053
in the first place his escape would be a serious misfortune to monsieur de chavigny whom he hated for the petty persecutions he owed to him				5.723545036768402
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all d artagnan blushed				102.15912032730598
she scarcely resisted				150.68722590476614
you know noirmont do you not				27.220362923973234
athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst d artagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully				26611.642319517694
what has become of him				9.373688740670161
that is i murmured milady in extreme terror what do you want we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos you shall be free to defend yourself				370.9244706998417
dantès uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing a grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury				1129.145878716284
yes yes i replied he				8.018901276011182
credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the of the next month to m de boville m morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor				14292.791594561493
i possessed a thousand francs				71.35148662116607
capital cried the gascon you would make a distinguished general and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard no to be sure replied d artagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him groslow s face brightened				3446.455350590505
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud				1210.2800562949535
she is ill				172.95679779782205
the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder				140.95820668354608
what do you mean by that you idiot asked d artagnan				1.0344300272607947
there seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to her majesty the queen of england and if she engages to answer for us i presume we shall be allowed to enter on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before				171.16242065835985
yes you cried franz whose hair stood on end you m noirtier you killed my father yes replied noirtier fixing a majestic look on the young man				1.9173691424595392
the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features				2357.2976699296437
the lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of porthos and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion the little negro and the maid servant				188.56644812385593
no no continued danglars if we resolve on such a step it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left hand that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose and danglars uniting practice with theory wrote with his left hand and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following lines which he handed to fernand and which fernand read in an undertone the honorable the king s attorney is informed by a friend of the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon arrived this morning from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a letter for the usurper and by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist committee in paris				54.1736771694895

the three presents of d artagnan the elder chapter ii				278.90369068690325
the boat indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding				13517.825844765563
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the opening and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky				1210.9265882052268
the quick eye of monte cristo however marked his coming and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips				32.74239842430575
valentine when her name was made the subject of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her eyes were cast down and she was crying				8979.669470020763
none of the lads of pampinara palestrina or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his companion				5627.506641291292
this disposition visible as it was in his majesty did not prevent the courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway				1099.117725414334
it is you who stabbed selim				4730.77109595822
i recognized it on your finger you bought it back then from monsieur des essarts asked porthos				13.286577592294432
porthos smiled				8.475285506180816
in a few minutes through all the doors down all the staircases by every exit everyone hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences which even the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes were seen to be utterly futile				2052.5940550742685
the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy spot called the catacombs of saint sebastian i know it said château renaud i narrowly escaped catching a fever there and i did more than that replied morcerf for i caught one				510.8082826027605
you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the rocks				3817.2147252944123
the duke porthos and d artagnan roared out both at once				72.98898033907362
at the end of three months he had learned to write				1070.3739163277398
then you will start after the queen no said mazarin again				511.53220503203363
they will promise everything for the sake of the money and on the road fear will prevent them from acting				144080.99890015018
did i advise your father to sell the castle of yanina to betray silence said albert with a thundering voice				31.144836289522857
let us go repeated d artagnan				1.036163688636244
she had met fernand at the corner of the rue de la loge she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch				13545.429128797707
each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas which sprang up with the flying spray of the sea				110.79938606496569
immediately the aldermen clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by six sergeants each holding a flambeau in his hand went to attend upon the king whom they met on the steps where the provost of the merchants made him the speech of welcome a compliment to which his majesty replied with an apology for coming so late laying the blame upon the cardinal who had detained him till eleven o clock talking of affairs of state				4511.938292150187
what is the matter with you my friend asked the latter				242.91278856565577
he had advanced at first but stopped at the sight of this display of force				1445.181227023611
on the day after the morrow by eleven o clock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was				118.7276368277185
scarcely had they entered when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor				2222.9250737357693
he approached the block and laid his axe upon it				7.481731767408482
villefort s only answer was a stifled groan				705.5731884035006
you are young and rich leave paris all is soon forgotten in this great babylon of excitement and changing tastes				44655.07372894067
but to return to what we were saying				1415.2792358505817
to remain silent and dignified in his presence from time to time to irritate him by affected disdain by a contemptuous word to provoke him to threats and violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignation such was her plan				1806.0467961696645
he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half past eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on it is likely well will you try and overtake him nothing i should like better if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty francs if not before louvres thirty and if we do overtake him forty said andrea after a moment s hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise				6529.80890357398
and yet what asked the abbé				17.414947544987676
nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream				250.1686418192349
if the letter must be written under your censure my faith i renounce the task and you will do right				1005.1296705730869
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives				1423.8840803178018
at the end of the next act with your permission i will come and inquire whether there is anything i can do for you in paris pray take notice said the countess that my present residence is rue de rivoli and that i am at home to my friends every saturday evening				175.8741724815209

it was about half past nine				4825.374738452769
yes what to do noirtier made no answer				91.70685453265922
water oh poor woman poor woman murmured athos in a broken voice				14.248531960230492
it was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league when d artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation				76175.93343055743
well said the count you do not get out m bertuccio you are going to stay in the carriage then				842.0600145094535
the committee decided to hear the letter the count was thoughtful and silent				796.1359739715743
madame he said you have wished to conquer the prince your brother that is to say the greatest captain of the age and when women of genius wish anything they always succeed in attaining it				10.13536688606486
what shall we do				35.59686309862008
now madame danglars feared eugénie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eugénie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers				1175.5354073776987
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly				37604.09527579627
from time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from the writings and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor mercer				1471.4316080258718
what will our two friends say				130.5294924986493

come with me then				40.39732657666104
he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised winter s head and unfastening the order of the saint esprit placed it on his own breast				339.8103735850895

a cloud settled on his brow evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the expression of offended pride which had lately reigned there				91.77829218463904
good answered grimaud and he went right to the prisoner				106.10915075584741

your betrothed valentine de villefort p s my poor grandmother gets worse and worse yesterday her fever amounted to delirium today her delirium is almost madness				3593.8498691039476
yes noirtier raised his eyes it was the sign agreed on between him and valentine when he wanted anything				348.28551032705263
dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his hands into his hair continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend				270.1504419621903
you too then are unhappy she said				5.219879949141599

villefort and his wife both grew red one from shame the other from anger				617.4120520556745
well my friend nothing now is lacking except that you should feel remorse for having killed that fellow hush said athos putting a finger on his lips with the sad smile peculiar to him let us talk no more of mordaunt it will bring bad luck and athos set forward toward charenton followed closely by aramis				84.43389123226737
now for my part i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece and hang me if i can guess where you took your notions of the other world from				5982.804895337452

should she forsake mazarin she must join her son and go over to the princes side but you know better than i do that there are certain reasons why she can never abandon mazarin perhaps you are right said aramis thoughtfully therefore i shall not pledge myself to them or to us do you mean aramis to no one				623.5801196940206
de morcerf s who is deceased for what reason because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired and what are they to live upon the mother retires into the country and the son enters the army well i must confess these are scruples i registered their deed of gift yesterday and how much did they possess oh not much from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs				142.8364061750582
you say we are going to see athos now and if you will come thither i beg you to make haste for we have lost much time already				1176.624478215531
but you my dear athos you who so generously distributed the englishman s pistoles which were our legitimate property what do you mean to do i am satisfied with having killed that fellow my boy seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an englishman but if i had pocketed his pistoles they would have weighed me down like a remorse go to my dear athos you have truly inconceivable ideas let it pass				1815.8192300109276
cloud and not elsewhere before the d estrées s pavilion and not in another street				250.6498415288418
the general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs				99935.80663527061
now said he i m off to the bishop s				37.993892482664045
a sailor on watch hailed the boat the boat replied				1989.5106783225392
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded				576.9538823616996
in truth my dear captain i have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to mademoiselle de chemerault to whom i promised an abbey				21874.07120176624
and pray asked franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage not out of my armory for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting knife				915.4498367265834
most likely replied vampa coolly				90.80347081991484
as for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of paris who has the very greatest power at the court of rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to him consider maillard said the curate that i have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that i have made myself responsible for you i know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore i in my turn will be serviceable to you and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le curé told me it was just now i think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever i go they will follow me and could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying down with mazarin as fell those at jericho i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades i will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them i faith exclaimed gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le curé can answer for you i answer for him said the curate				12529.361843076009
do not forget that				61.91189925354455
you have done this i hope so at least madame de villefort stretched out her hands and fell on her knees				386.5790696587136
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name than mine a name				168.24007213284793
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied				8791.419998361143
how do you mean yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars				8.916758567911806
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette				1162.1170423188298
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him				13.646231484536175
a propos monseigneur continued tréville addressing the cardinal monsieur de cahusac is quite recovered is he not thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger				557.1699190388255
a loan nothing more				165.15894634246877
the bracieux estate was a few leagues from villars cotterets				1181.3997712305763
he watched the effect of this question on the old man				3.374159815937204
neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it				43.984364521373244
it appears there is something fresh aboard aramis said athos you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the parpaillot i believe yes how did you fare for my part i ate but little				803.7192304820727
lord de winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the duke s chamber				104.0998418323363
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection				254709.7119705867
the following morning jacopo set sail for marseilles with directions from dantès to join him at the island of monte cristo				1.094612476376498
valentine repeated the same voice				52.362200028198714
monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence prudence monsieur is a virtue sufficiently useless to musketeers i know but indispensable to churchmen and as i am only a musketeer provisionally i hold it good to be prudent				3848.5809905606257
but not before one o clock replied d artagnan				1.034820080258117
and are the first of men added d artagnan				1.043809653743421
in twenty four hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days afterwards				5905.506383787545
but d artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m bazin and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friend s valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five				2618.210662965541
what then how much do you require for my ransom merely the you have about you danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart				30.191749544354
monsieur de comminges he said				3.9695786819253644
well let us as you say go and ask a dinner from the master of that house				463.97783801065043
avenge me of that infamous de wardes said milady between her teeth and i shall soon know how to get rid of you you double idiot you animated sword blade fall voluntarily into my arms hypocritical and dangerous woman said d artagnan likewise to himself after having abused me with such effrontery and afterward i will laugh at you with him whom you wish me to kill d artagnan lifted up his head				18.331538286363415
some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minute s air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice will there be another funeral today at the procureur s house madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell				961.5508402203909
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further				533.3682029670895
well my dear viscount said monte cristo i have an infallible remedy to propose to you what is that asked the young man				1.7498633667759733
athos played and that as a rule unfortunately				14000.713280521013
you are in a hurry said the musketeer as pale as a sheet				5107.7639195116235
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage				70.38134093587682
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow				941.4930306200488
how madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the king s safety				4089.65735323014
keep back my lord said d artagnan				1.033908368611956
yes looked the invalid his eye beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning				1813.3644740851878
at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myself for i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglers but for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend				9396.640668442007
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo				1.055110215172932
i will go with you and he took his sword and cloak				2385.3599906804907
at the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir madame de villefort was standing erect pale her features contracted and her eyes glaring horribly				5866.8240008612365
thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the chimney corner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as no				115.42538741375861
she went to the palais replied the steward				584.2340794402077
but continued morcerf à propos of danglars we have strangely wandered from the subject				154.82810214644678
this announcement was received in silence				137.8273133143679
go then and set about this work in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me				8.662784091340312
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the eyes and holding in their hands lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the head				109.06220124672049
it bears his signature as you see which is all sufficient bring me a million such as that said danglars i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his pocket				126.2746746371756
cowardly court				74.51541890830747
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain				23598.518390617606
but could i do with a million retorted the count				9.074230778799198
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est d artagnan whose erudition we are well acquainted with evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham				202.3575500382291
well did there not happen an event which saved austria				2565.513862875951
the count of monte cristo i believe said he				24.877220399471287
some wine cried the stupefied host some wine				358.1090111578324
master broussel is being strangled it was friquet s voice and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk				17763.391181757965
one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event				338.82840949757485
go d artagnan go grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon a half hour afterward d artagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any accident				8309.574228638992
then he had a moment s hesitation				15275.048859093644
and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit				1037.7878195818298
he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen				41.39133565218816
from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life				280.25909958288986
he therefore informed m morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of march that is ten or twelve days after napoleon s return				1517.9820579701202
from this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous				6409.412915330132
i have committed no crime				526.4423829430913
i am betrayed on all sides				413.17409333030525
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost				411.148423498372
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan				1.0698424579475119
maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot				63094.757306036074
do you know his house at auteuil certainly what do you know respecting it do you wish to know why he bought it yes the count is a speculator who will certainly ruin himself in experiments				355015.51200997445
ah he is one who fears neither god nor satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said franz				37.60588481414673
since the death of madame de saint méran i have known that a poisoner lived in my house				172.4967209376928
he can not make me forget what i shall have lost thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on				72.37633816501226
i mean to ask if you are married ah				71.57946419505397
a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow				1014.6697393292216
i know that i must have been mad senseless to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm but what then				99.52999925929235
we are four of us said d artagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time				112.75043215302787
i would as willingly accuse myself				211.71879206898888
dantès took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body				629.4045104338222
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly				86918.35711545944
go and tell laporte to wake and dress the king and then pass on to the marechal de villeroy and summon him to me bernouin bowed and retired				430.1289324771768
he swam to the cap placed it on his head seized one of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking				434.1851557771455
adieu paris adieu his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise				950.1961835647289
i was worn out with fatigue				566.1462321642908
these glances frequently exasperated the pride of danglars but this evening he took no notice of them				21.630921878143926
chapter lvii				32.11438577657008
i will go said comminges and if they come back fire not at all not at all replied d artagnan let no one move				1279.291635910233
it was about eleven o clock at night				184.42488273070765
barrois his features convulsed his eyes suffused with blood and his head thrown back was lying at full length beating the floor with his hands while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend				22680.1501136385
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands				45.236463522367735
scott of course the son of an ill fated sire and the father of a yet more unfortunate family bore in his looks that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death the abbot ch				7154.07056037839
look here resumed d artagnan here is monsieur de bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges the devil said porthos and his guardian what would he have said to that do you hear interrupted d artagnan become a frondist my friend belong to the fronde and remember that i fill the count s place in everything and he jingled his money				112.93413055135933
my drunkenness is always sad and when i am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain				482.23820183039805
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination				1511.38280741734
on landing the count turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding morrel				171.10733831685246
besides my friend providence has warned us that we may be on our guard				365.30757493881356
what is this that m de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders				65.34106744379196
they soon tired of the sport				17598.18133212791
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris				101.47001887723924
you would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald green sea you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning				40209.13774913816
gentlemen your hands are we not pretty good christians egad said d artagnan by heaven				121.26149314103155
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth				6580.65882276951
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside oh no				83.0029122287889
because he had no cash to save				287555.9874428111
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded				718.2834315047131
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt				3562.6599099438213
i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder				849.5215019612873
the night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take				1589.868448781143
but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of milady was increased by his not having killed her brother in law				1749.978164082138
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings				4625.283325856338
then calling planchet he said now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said planchet				179.99211698796944
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him				6.866570823272396
but if he be willing to accept my offers will you oppose them you well know edmond that i am no longer a reasoning creature i have no will unless it be the will never to decide				197371.0179233449
i have two things to postpone and what are they first a thrust with the coadjutor whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet s and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me oh fie a quarrel between priests a duel between allies what can i do friend				1849.6078451040114
dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner				218.95640004499398
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence				21153.37343527122
dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak				8156.736475804597
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee my word of honor sir said athos				4.50648290645468
morcerf s courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow				1273.5247924687326
you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient				9022.865472017193
no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity				25752.873662607355
his best known work is the three graces now in the louvre				239.57467092171586
still further monsieur de tréville gains ten thousand crowns a year he is therefore a great noble				24411.13469665752
benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool sweet child murmured monte cristo				1.062168717344484
take something mme				16.950789277928866
you are discreet so much the better				39.29306051075392
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions				32369.95393256369
danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him				5.346116354776279
arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband gaspard consider well what you are about to do i have both reflected and decided answered he				59.04838660200187
but he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers carlini was killed				173.44605397223123
d artagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished				17600.5310996856
the closet was empty				72.83715002796635
she had still four days before her				14.480196311285692
don t stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife grinder				27863.55933160523
but as lord wilmore in the character of the count s enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english				5083.858880384569
this did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghost for he trod so softly that no sound was heard then poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it				24.021336156590756
do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin				34.65318540366372
ten days passed away thus				257.9801570632279
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living imbecile exclaimed la carconte				12.307585249758588
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose				363.70001852347445
she loves him devilishly he murmured				156.43728894088503
but allow me to say that you must have been very young then i was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory in what manner could these events concern you				13.433202549981987
she is a foreigner a stranger				5879.785218122344
oh i am a christian cried dantès guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him				5.390048902309756

jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis				7116.861393330402
oh sir planchet only touched the tips of the count s fingers				4255.228008074625

there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real interrupted the count smiling				148.2796782327401
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace				4231.574390418499
no returned she but i feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation				81094.27248577026
i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied d artagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos another i disarmed or wounded i don t remember which wounded said athos it was a phenomenon of skill the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose				430.90614794107745
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brother s pay alone kept her				18.23995071489067
on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him				15.552155960162949
then that is agreed said the king and that is all i had to say to you but on what day will this ball take place asked anne of austria				45.59936709712915
wife wife cried he in a hoarse voice come here diamond exclaimed la carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step what diamond are you talking about why did you not hear all we said inquired caderousse				29.033938057326285
has not some sage said nothing too much				175.00623900687268
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask				1023.0366057883033
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram				83249.34715216441
bonacieux prophesied				14.736482380889484
are you looking for anything mr procureur asked benedetto with his most ingratiating smile				69.86770245769266
oh heavens continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward				648.8986039302711
i am mistaken monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him no no no said comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were i clearly understood what the cardinal said to me				13.710783762434424

as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table				255.8045219303
no no look look the recommendation was needless				48231.78016251623
you have been here a very long time john said he				13.724271358732237
hey friend cried the duke				10.23529847138764
i don t need the quarter of such a sum i who am still only in the guards and by selling my saddles i shall procure it				5.028003651343099
but then your word is given yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not				47.8932780941679
i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express surely so trifling a circumstance can not deserve a place in your remembrance				4186.572907289647
but one thing i can tell you of which i do not think you are aware that is that i have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation noirtier regarded his daughter in law with the look of a man desiring an explanation				6826.390205468227
what after the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing				2568.3890804932594
and how proceed it is now eleven answered grimaud				54.698500719163654
i give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter that is true answered the marquis				7386.52393399794
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat				1304.0824470273092
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him				3.2484708894435577
you marry a money bag label it is true well but what does that matter				1335.5847383618582
you aramis why the devil did you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock				4040.631632471326
sir said d artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers well that is scarcely the question				154.94420294429102
the queen was as we have said of great beauty				1877.420281909151
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence				52603.94210830551
well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those				150375.79130196664
you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse				87.59617322279865
and now said athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign				83196.32967495712
he went with groslow to the captain s berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by captain rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat				4658.280166746798
all minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language				2455.001015608758
adieu i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him go straight to his box that will be the simplest plan but i have never been presented presented to whom to the beautiful greek you say she is only a slave while you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess				549.7504536626877
but lose no time we have lost too much already that is true				193.08724027371173
my lord cried the gascon don t threaten				10795.980096688763
the man was one of those puritans half preacher and half soldier who swarmed around cromwell				1512.2514805551873
i have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend				143.00644101746008
now then said villefort placing the letter in his pocketbook i must have another to whom to the king to the king yes i dare not write to his majesty i do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask m de salvieux to do so				140.39708048554922
he questioned me concerning captain leclere s death and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris				65.42031668222366
no thank you do you wish anything leave me to pray the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back				146.45639140269805
i shall work doctor when i work i forget everything and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in work				786.8430745191047
at the first glance d artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy				29035.920667987604
thou man of noble heart woe is me				115.82478014928928
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved him i love him				29.538676257936363

marseilles the arrival chapter				1.1065696441883541
the magistrates freely discussed their political views the military part of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the women commented on the divorce of josephine				23588.93307965786
will that do yes what are you looking at i am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that				66.82042011763998
grimaud followed athos				4.156491842981816
ah said morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted				8724.069510048392
you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond said to bear the name repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager				11524.341396373151
go for i see how impatient you are then i have leave go i tell you may i have the use of your skiff certainly then for the present m morrel farewell and a thousand thanks i hope soon to see you again my dear edmond				233.2597708854973
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at francs each he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars				10.908539441509806
let us not lose a moment the four friends resumed their own clothes girded on their swords ordered mousqueton and blaisois to pay the bill and to arrange everything for immediate departure and wrapped in their large cloaks left in search of their game				2906.699159741034
he has been beaten				637.9461404817214
well well said he you are brave young men proud in daylight faithful in darkness				544.6790094391359
in short doctor although i know you to be the most conscientious man in the world and although i place the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with myself why do you ask me that what do you wish send for him i will tell him what i have seen and we will consult together and examine the body and you will find traces of poison no i did not say of poison but we can prove what was the state of the body we shall discover the cause of her sudden death and we shall say dear villefort if this thing has been caused by negligence watch over your servants if from hatred watch your enemies what do you propose to me d avrigny said villefort in despair so soon as another is admitted into our secret an inquest will become necessary and an inquest in my house impossible				436.9524799422291
mousqueton also attracted attention and as the romance of don quixote was then the fashion they said that he was sancho who after having lost one master had found two				975.2150441301967
it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her				29.309035052689513
they sat silent and dejected				167.4254595679542
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or lost ah said groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all i can understand that said d artagnan				146.44039986628724
are you a man				155.86284492931503
made richelieu smile				319.0752960093942
you incline me to think so said the king				17.823842602943053
i thought i did not mistake				909.8455505012103
well the abbé adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage				101146.03093377828
at length the light disappeared				277.2299793578199
he sprang into his saddle the lackey took his place by the coachman the carriage went off at a quick pace escorted by the three horsemen and all was over				168.70150535542146
what is that again he asked				8.565075260997501
in strafford s company said mordaunt tauntingly				1062.648027203508
you have read the letter yes you know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in italy this is the name of the lower class				6523.858307246616
i lent you money and you returned it that s like good neighbors and we are quits we are never quits with those who oblige us was dantès reply for when we do not owe them money we owe them gratitude what s the use of mentioning that				138.5636417314816
at this moment villefort returned				155.6769299446256
felton had not spoken				396.90234253127255
i see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach				5534.340482486366
well sir said de guiche are you going to reply i am a priest said the young man				1.750852618749936
most decidedly said he men are not equal and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers chapter				267.13566387470036
planchet two hours before had asked his master for some dinner and he had answered him with the proverb he who sleeps dines and planchet dined by sleeping				2051.7329330152756
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed				10106.141913319092
see that cluster of persons collected around poor ali who is as much astonished as themselves really one might suppose he was the only nubian they had ever beheld				4101.844102538803
who comes there he cried				26.530747368733046
the soldier returned and felton gave him back his weapon				17224.489324874216
have you a letter of audience asked a porter advancing to the new arrival				2755.657952429299
excellency cried the cicerone seeing franz approach the window shall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology his first impulse was to look round him but these words were addressed to him				5.132665546667149
a war of partisans unworthy of a king the example of robert bruce will absolve you sire no no				92.66746577210178
the procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have employed in entering a court of justice				689.0061430869691
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman i will kill you at the corner of some wall as i would a mad dog i like the means well enough said d artagnan but where and how to meet with her time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of man				778.8450510140759
i know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and i am brave also				517.7564940516575
the carnival at rome when franz recovered his senses he saw albert drinking a glass of water of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the count who was assuming his masquerade costume				1223.8967360442925
but you say you do not wish to kill me no and yet you will let me perish with hunger ah that is a different thing well then wretches cried danglars i will defy your infamous calculations i would rather die at once				56.36279794645398
it was already too late				409.3463638889421
cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence i do not understand stammered lucien				12662.711545309297
d artagnan did not draw his sword porthos put his back into the sheath				37618.87334752121
he then descended but it was only when he felt his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety				2664.1186136110264
the anjou wine chapter xliii				16.960859353233047
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a prie dieu all its furniture				1382.2952561481175
i prefer traveling alone to having a companion who entertains the least fear monsieur does me wrong said planchet i thought he had seen me at work yes but i thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first time monsieur shall see that upon occasion i have some left only i beg monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this evening i hope so monsieur well then i count on you at the appointed hour i shall be ready only i believed that monsieur had but one horse in the guard stables perhaps there is but one at this moment but by this evening there will be four it appears that our journey was a remounting journey then exactly so said d artagnan and nodding to planchet he went out				35.10623311891957
but listen to me valentine and i will tell you all about it				6.194299901729102
the cardinal there awaited louis xiii				1.8972541970313945
milady appeared to have entirely recovered				7913.028895783972
oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of milady				74.89293717784598
oh my god cried anne of austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell				2523.675816538924
andrea was gone				26.79113146131331
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m bertuccio i cried the steward with a strange expression				206.58192389941854
still you must breakfast somewhere but if i am not hungry said the young man				1.7522468873649966
suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard				672.6869462371081
impostor indeed m				67.23402702253648
in the farthest angle of the second opening said the cardinal s will				525.8354980077613

day came the jailer entered				15.672302005867582
well madame unhesitatingly repeated debray				104.17740632136147
as d artagnan had no time to lose on account of the audience of the king which was fixed for midday he cast his eyes around and seeing that the street was empty said to his adversary my faith				172.37741333651056
every night the count had given him news which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier				182.16183520073469
and do you know whither he went no not precisely however i think it was something very like a rendezvous diavolo said the duke this is a bad day or rather a bad night to be out late is it not countess these words were addressed to the countess g who had just arrived and was leaning on the arm of signor torlonia the duke s brother				263.731144197419
it resulted from this that the real stake in this game which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men was simply a kind look from anne of austria				57.709501416652486
this method was so simple that d artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively				41309.985110543785
he remained there ten minutes motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own heart				91.49614713273081
the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden box				434.3764988357029
i do not know you i am said i the little abbé who reads lives of the saints and translates judith into verse ah ah				24.146875366921268

politics has made you laugh at everything and political men have made you disbelieve everything				187.19119496545363
sire continued m de blacas if it only be to reassure a faithful servant will your majesty send into languedoc provence and dauphiné trusty men who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces canimus surdis replied the king continuing the annotations in his horace				9641.609977644623

bah said porthos why separate since we are all together because you can and ought to return to france your mission is accomplished but ours is not your mission is not accomplished exclaimed d artagnan looking in astonishment at athos				14.78756846935671
franz was deeply affected				49.74099076958463
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron				683.6250217809048
may i ask what you were doing there my father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in london were you pleased with paris sir yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our own not against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an italian the queen s favorite ah				177.02449766772756
now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not certainly said morrel i am at your service count still what it is desirable i should know the real cause that is to say you would rather not no the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side enough said morrel who is your second witness i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel				5844.051740633863
often he was driven away oftener still had he a dread of being sent away				146.73921999016838
be prudent				28.57412622135522
how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life				264.37252803217626

the storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen				127.80282706647847
follow him said athos				3.5222083272959424
d artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeer s uniform in every street of the camp				276.55990815945194
he shed the blood of strafford that confirms what i said just now blood will have blood				3569.8088644989825
remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue				15073.452241304332
do you observe said the countess g to albert who had returned to her side that man does nothing like other people he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable and when the fourth begins takes his departure chapter				1458.5849808405987
but the easy chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room				84.5890392853724

and how did he treat you with more of mildness than severity did you tell him your whole story i did and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape				65991.20058313257
he will be condemned will he not asked debray of beauchamp				146.44109815019326
at the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed				154424.1424259699
not yet replied porthos				11.706642792537119
oh my dear d artagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me				18.53420844502129
on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides yes added athos i now ask you d artagnan what side you are on				124.50876390794555
porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar				26184.629477846705
he hurt my shoulder				276.88305633040187
marry forsooth people don t die of hunger here and aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window				46.43736830285517
fourteen years he muttered				22.160542255738644
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majesty s voice and await the order of their captain have they not heard that of their colonel				9370.116776978413
felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment				136.1467033588047
she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days				529.4123491819986
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me hark said morrel				28.374096314573205
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed				1329.410718898939
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land				690.0954686793851
he thought that voice more feeble than usual				4576.579311331091
the shade of richelieu was mazarin				308.07047134659024
now said the count let us follow him franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley				6872.710143354339
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into truly athos interrupted d artagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of				149.28802516709874

cambalet his niece while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke all things which appeared to d artagnan monstrous impossibilities				579.596599849546
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan				24732.78031198765
he confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade the same who was killed to carry off a young woman who was to leave paris by the barrière de la villette but having stopped to drink at a cabaret they had missed the carriage by ten minutes				821.8687849721098
caderousse entered hastily				60.506585400594815

the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him much more so would be that of the king				85.93099725558206
louvieres recognized him and bowed				378.3898475464135
we can not say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly				9930.795290459322
athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin i think i know what you want replied athos				4.765182336080489
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped				4939.221077560793
now chevalier he added turning to aramis let us go				181.80258317638638
maximilian said valentine maximilian come back i entreat you he drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood				3501.0129138244597
come gentlemen cried harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be off where do we sleep colonel at thirsk replied harrison				6151.528296564218
the sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembrances				14390.707421271158
yes said he i made a vow to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow expires now what are we to do with you said the captain				119.49689481233669
whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here this voice the sound of which reached d artagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten				164.60018952948627
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil				319.13722583030693
one must take the world as one finds it				10.135871938740287
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips				33.24693281842967
do you hear not a single creature				28378.78074195609
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were				533.92140259084
danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word				119.01529952770275
bonacieux dead and d artagnan in a swoon				11308.016883993982
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints				8596.526475907162
athos arrested				48.45346197048522
then who loads his pistol his servant a nubian a negro it is he then do you know this gentleman yes and i am come to look for him he is a friend of mine oh that is quite another thing then				63.432645216155294

presently the army came in sight of lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault				10359.664042681803
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m noirtier s eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son				129.99295777349107
what a noise about a musketeer				705.5227236811719
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert				3050.700764833924
what are you doing asked milady with surprise				250.59283737349074
had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday no your excellency replied the valet de chambre the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag				25418.883060249562
it was now one o clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home				235.63075170483742
madame resumed athos two of my friends named d artagnan and monsieur du vallon sent to england by the cardinal suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of france no one knows what has become of them well said the queen				9.21328204034559
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance				8602.825066278248
come calm yourself and reckon them up m				78.60634033806606
i met him on the boulevard on my way here said beauchamp				48.51100298919886
now then what had i better do return instantly				1231.7179252888598
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort				26.073570937259987
well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel				638.980028421649
consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret				2899.39293256057
go to the count of monte cristo avenue des champs élysées on the of may at seven o clock in the evening and demand of him your father				74.37342748255196
remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below				7948.584410721104
you know no one but monsieur de tréville he asked				12.617728441981182
my friend				7.68447251555092
yes yes the mortuary deposition				954.1598935259965
it would be exceedingly droll the gascon with his vivid imagination had already seen the advantage to be derived from his situation				975.4889786523167
off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere and the cargo inquired the owner eagerly				76.43407787996034
athos made no reply				337.591461810942
then too i confess i should not be sorry to come across mordaunt again				120.40213772436223
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos				4.658994458970178
he remained motionless on the spot pressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat				308.32588841028956
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger				276.19472650599664
the gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors and as i have said the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator they every moment burst into fits of laughter				467.5452911257985
grimaud rose				22.568717154091566
certainly continued danglars the sacrifice was no trifling one when the beauty of the bride is concerned				5668.318224138389
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag				3829.6924537290843
you are almost a boy i see that you require someone to answer for me i admit that would reassure me greatly do you know athos no porthos no aramis no				20.806897018986074
it was empty and dantès emerged from the tunnel				31470.37753639583
good it is by my side				366.2619994249102
when you arrive at the first step of the church of san giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rose colored ribbons to the shoulder of your harlequin costume in order that you may be recognized				1948.692626145957
you have spared me yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance i was the most guilty				1114.4891619823563
my mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved				50286.354862639375

quite quite alone replied the man or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing you are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment				311.68853206912246
can it be on account of the amours of madame de bois tracy said d artagnan wishing to have the air in the eyes of the citizen of being posted as to court affairs				3223.23327942792
i had well concerted my plans pursued aramis the coadjutor gave me sixty men twenty guard the walls of the park twenty the road from rueil to saint germain twenty are dispersed in the woods				51605.04026015363
god will punish you				7.369609792738071
you can understand our disappointment when arriving at a pretty little house on the skirts of a wood which at a distance had quite a gay appearance with its red roof and green shutters we found nothing but a poor wretch bathed ah				157.30378965560828
this voice was that of my father				59.79724256559374
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before				383.5783693800315
this gascon is a precious fellow even his misadventures are of use the cardinal referred to that man whom d artagnan upset at the corner of the cimetiere saint jean in paris and who was no other than the councillor broussel				12576.972971819152
a conjugal scene chapter xlvi				410.10831923198197
if they ask it what have i to say that is true murmured mazarin in a low tone but as thy life is not mine i suppose i must buy it must i not and sighing deeply he began to turn the hoop of his ring outside again				195.71723378134587
contrary to the custom of a man so firm and decided there was this morning in his personal appearance something tardy and irresolute				91718.58351496515
they separated and d artagnan rushed between them like a dart				17932.717116122985
one individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could				2448.3549638031263
the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell				302.01304130902184
andrea surrounded by his friends complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his dream was almost bewildered				11481.448685215024
but contrary to all expectation when the of august came the house opened as usual and cocles appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision				6140.632033409172
her pose which i must admit was rather free wounded this officer				822.7812367657613
i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterday s riot which to day is already a rebellion to morrow may become a revolution yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely				253.61421790313065
well i will teach you how to behave yourself and i will send you back to your mass book master abbé				674.536432431047
speak he who has negotiated these matters forgive me if i begin by speaking of myself but i must claim that importance which has been given to me not assumed by me he who has arranged matters for the return of the cardinal ought it appears to me in order that his reward may not be unworthy of your majesty to be made commandant of the guards an appointment something like that of captain of the musketeers tis the appointment monsieur de tréville held you ask of me the place madame is vacant and although tis a year since monsieur de tréville has left it it has not been filled but it is one of the principal military appointments in the king s household monsieur de tréville was but a younger son of a simple gascon family like me madame he occupied that post for twenty years you have an answer ready for everything replied the queen and she took from her bureau a document which she filled up and signed				976.3550058684717
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the allées de meilhan at marseilles				215.26833069014722
guard her				61.18713170141858
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man				7.665297682463373
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men two men how do you mean yes the king and his lackey oh				615.4183288577993
how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than livres of our money a sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy				11247.421831272533
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window				614.4741309783305
i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before in short if i go will you go too i will try you torment me giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then of many things what are they mazarin s face smiling as it was became clouded				4068.584442196505
you can understand that one of two things must have happened he must either have fallen flat in which case the blow from a height of ninety feet must have killed him instantly or he must have fallen upright and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom where he remained poor fellow then you pity him said the count				5.803850385443111
i tried to speak				159.8994062566331
yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the borgia family for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the cardinal cæsar spada but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his companion in misfortune				1691.7332481604415
come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me				8.27400874832815
if d artagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is				109.59728800191687
buckingham left alone walked toward a mirror				38944.39047360662
half an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly the count had just pulled the silken check string which was fastened to ali s finger				936.570757948744
good god cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon she will never write like monsieur de voiture what does you mean by boor michon said the swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came				1962.5029186970996

madame danglars turned very pale then exclaimed i can not believe it the thing is impossible i assure you madame replied the woman it is as i have said turning impatiently towards her husband madame danglars demanded is this true is what true madame inquired danglars visibly agitated				2665.4744227386227

there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently				2301.3890581799487
the latter leaving the shore abandoned themselves gaily to the current				32545.525231175852
he therefore seized the little epistle and opened it eagerly				186.49626231234154
listen to me				3.2015154846521123
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera and if you can bring château renaud with you beauchamp availed himself of albert s permission and left him promising to call for him at a quarter before eight				3609.450712574825
milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak therefore she knew him				12.484882218387856
but how asked mazarin				51.09312851233362
oh i would advance ten millions on his signature				2484.942024690861
two or three chairs were thrown down as if there had been a struggle				344.82223460259286
but do not let us lose time you are the subject on which i wish to speak true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass together ma foi said maximilian in consternation				2465.073872520626

as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions				20183.82372534132
the stranger waved his hand and continued to descend				2251.5812094132125

two hours thus glided away				38.288677955582145
she knew she had only two days left that when once the order was signed by buckingham and buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name and he could not therefore recognize the woman in question once this order was signed we say the baron would make her embark immediately and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world whose style the voice of fashion lauds and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors				1585.5961937976413

he delayed presenting himself at morrel s but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him				3.1550379532420068
you do not understand me gentlemen said d artagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun				291.98613378028404
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve				362.68637316280444
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are				67.09634361638578

oh pray do for heaven s sake tell us all about is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving				870.9484135569753
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced				4074.80512030739
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you can all three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools				86164.511459563
athos was pale and trembled in every limb				31699.028998375943
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil as he alighted comminges approached him				6.050225585254284
from twelve to two o clock danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker				1738.3090111586932

the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dantès question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port				458.2743898188981
well sir said the abbé you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the abbé				17.357255127757153
on reaching her room eugénie locked her door while louise fell on a chair				138.1742312718557

villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal				17421.809748903863
one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him				15.44482768961148
ah i am an unfortunate king monsieur de tréville				17.61578954881907

gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself hear me count replied d artagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts i wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur d herblay				36.174686068473626
adieu adieu dearest edmond cried mercédès stretching out her arms to him from the balcony				2011.592193865883
an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you can not grudge it to me debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie				7874.387611267274
help me here i am sir said athos leaning and stretching out his arm to mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him here i am take my hand and jump into our boat mordaunt made a last effort rose seized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair				285.2288105710078
they drew near to the sloop				862.8830606670782
indeed said athos				3.6873697595705557
did i not see you the other day smile on the duke of orleans				1264.719682260948
and whose horses are these cried d artagnan				1.0547280304197786
it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier				7002.7303687348385
only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door				14.529690708947573
well just as you like my prince there s liberty for all the world				84.62950516406109
besides what would the sailors say				355.63560045573706
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbé in a monk s dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages				28209.245341506445
that is a serious thing monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said				109.78490524075191
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends				202.15800736788668
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion				574.3952438988489
i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man				4.342489514255492
you are alone one alone shall answer you you have a sword by your side i have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve you				10.866179470741415
i still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myself no indeed you have then a repugnance to your profession so long as i struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly sheltered as i was by justice and law but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of god s creatures since that day the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair				281.37545670178406
how do you mean the receipt of m de monte cristo is as good as money take it to rothschild s or lafitte s and they will take it off your hands at once what though payable at rome certainly it will only cost you a discount of or francs the receiver started back				276.8302501146611
they had not long to wait for an answer				444.4201001308619
my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes and will you go asked kitty				351.1517451666668
yes yes continued m de tréville growing warmer as he spoke and his majesty was right for upon my honor it is true that the musketeers make but a miserable figure at court				560.972218498853
well that is not impossible				135.95662113989675
enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me i shall not be more than half an hour and while the three musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him				8.417889745736934
athos was then sent to the cardinal but unfortunately the cardinal was at the louvre with the king				96.90031648923664

what say you to that crime of which i have the proof she was my mother on our return to france she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the augustines at bethune				1989.3532049004243
i have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write they then separated				3729.7137291470217
when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost				19899.19661867995
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death				366.4649958569128

mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d artagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood				1566.342743621312
then you were about to tell me all the isolation of your life the griefs of your heart				44.96043114000556

the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover				1140.0059896699563

which whichever of the three you like i have no preference and the rich caparison is that mine too without doubt you laugh d artagnan no i have left off laughing now that you speak french what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silver are they all for me for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos peste they are three superb animals i am glad they please you why it must have been the king who made you such a present certainly it was not the cardinal but don t trouble yourself whence they come think only that one of the three is your property i choose that which the red headed boy is leading it is yours good heaven				579.6397156716556

what cried d artagnan				1.0649744304738595
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him				8.034166655474674
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word				146.50179174027932
that devil porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck at villars cotterets he wrote to the cardinal my lord i have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty men				357.5568589304078

ha ha ha she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arms stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless				363.32110749614304
who can tell whether mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us what				388.9426234471955
now since d artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way				752.7402155974354
aramis porthos and d artagnan drew their chairs near him				3.9904394299244994
it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat				6499.081149589049
she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect				1537.4098831476235

by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel				565.488992465584
what line would you advise me to study the one that is most in use just at this time the spanish one you mean i suppose yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you no said monte cristo since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it				5.834938944149469
see said d avrigny to villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow				1329.0969692757508
sure of being killed by athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos				61.05670697052477
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master benedetto at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprised groom retired				529.2109376074764

towards the evening of the third day				217.01795396422867
the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground				28.3597177566369
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt				2147.033873903725
and as the man approached d artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern				59442.08744163147
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before then meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos				9.58035000790137
ah said andrea deeply affected				315.4680494809473
thou hast prospered and grown stout and d artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one				197.62206600149773
i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor				452.05026215496196
the time for wine came				110.14051439451721
he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future				904.5252678661435
this brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale topaz				5808.9952204154615
i read the advertisement in one of the papers and was tempted by the false title a country house it is not yet too late cried bertuccio eagerly and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission i will find you a better at enghien at fontenay aux roses or at bellevue oh no returned monte cristo negligently since i have this i will keep it and you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his fee				17463.329517855058
but as m de toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemy s camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action				672.0470096056087
when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast the materialist and the scoffer great city murmured he inclining his head and joining his hands as if in prayer less than six months have elapsed since first i entered thy gates				5168.593660510346

stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of despair				225.51495123760193
that was the question the three musketeers put to one another				146.84883504735672
yes i have replied franz i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered cæsar s commentaries said the bandit it is my favorite work well are you coming asked albert				40.54722894813175
sleep well your last night as citizen i am to be a soldier then said the young man				1.7623463931623584
i beg you will remove your bandage it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty years of age dressed in a tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle				4304.315773037087
he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink				1140.515997907005
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken				1413.6692668671783
he is not curious thought d artagnan				1.0484058838223707
he tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for it				6.01030149378088
whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazin s house				176.23498672783575
milady asked some questions about the carriage				198.28649035220803
a complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour good my friend said d artagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing i do not think it i am certain of it quick quick d artagnan				1.0689253792419744
oh how distinctly i remember that kiss it was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead				415.5981782878626
ah cursed gascon that i am i get from one hobble into another				181.28724801858036
the moment for my escape is fixed seven o clock				2.7467926235137665
a great poet				23.707727462772564
it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden				1229.034410521655
the matter was no longer doubtful				3758.199161229407
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti oh do not confound the two eugénie hold your tongue				369.0381831161997
and then continued mme				13.805759093023573
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me this threat brought no reply				610.0528596155676
toward the town of louvres was the reply				860.5224881653586
no replied athos with a singular smile				96.00888384457119
was i not nearly your husband and with this raillery andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd				204.33480422508626
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers				7815.307042448983
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused				7911.587654637516
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge s door and which merits a particular description				5674.521988303504
she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves that immense breaking of the ocean with her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans thou leavest thy servants lord to see if they be strong but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on these verses were not excellent very far from it but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry				9924.518171592033
signed el kobbir that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it near the merchant s signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor				442.99809243487243
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening before				564.8748026415917
monsieur said albert with affectionate courtesy the count of château renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me you are his friend be ours also well said interrupted château renaud and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me what has he done asked albert				35.87878998616989
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber				71.18395003366597
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized				1616.1069537506153
i did not even know that you were the person i was sent to fetch impossible you a favorite of the minister a favorite				22816.04264978013
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty				966.0100042460291
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance				43054.88023615048
is she not free to love whomsoever she will oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing				2687.8060910717672
the conversation took a cheerful turn				330.66175428861936
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too grand				178915.23670229703
oh dear no your excellency				299.24038550120315
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect no not perfect was the count s reply only impenetrable that s all				203.0642312041068
château renaud was at his post apprised by beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from albert				262.0152654608232
in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose				34887.52671372169
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at d artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship				6926.798440084358
we on our side do the same				161.57285720324
in that hotel				97.50448309335086
albert followed him with the count				68.99049453473098
i will introduce you to them but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars				27.139735976741992
you didn t know king charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side				458.9207970711056
louis xviii				9.864157829998577
the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantès forehead large drops of perspiration				320.46238315060145
bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery				17792.569703365778
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp				70647.41310844495
this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint				2464.0538027400266
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet				8265.96098922654
what s your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the sorbonne and the rue de l universite				753.2956921302774
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere				37750.12148351387
hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered				139.4809732893425
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london the devil				474.34067762237424
he launched into a eulogy of his eminence and said that he should not have failed to enter into the guards of the cardinal instead of the king s guards if he had happened to know m de cavois instead of m de tréville				31.71241335839448
my god silence both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking				1819.8863466171097
by degrees everyone awoke				288.62182402240296
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed				3355.246136393889
i can just suit you ah said porthos brightening that s well as regards my horse but i must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred livres three hundred livres				451.1815516338973
i have placed reliance upon you my friend				34.184672869274834
i know these lovers				2446.5332264869335
i forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle				1727.5404058650306
with his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter				44275.63193102791
you must set out for boulogne				1891.033832178547
from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice				318.36753375888816
stop a minute answered caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night				308.9127669521887
nobody knew				100.80897278513235
there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society				4392.766043882411
oh take it take it said the count haydée is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know ali left the room				55.96824996124284
the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples				414.0335850994553
aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of st augustine which he was forced to write in latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good deal				2694.446798223292
look gentlemen all these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the count s forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt ali s blood still lingering there				152.9917599981206
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger				1236.58000756642
this was now all changed				500.0391491903797
haydée would it please you not to leave me i am young gently replied haydée i love the life you have made so sweet to me and i should be sorry to die you mean then that if i leave you haydée i should die yes my lord do you then love me oh valentine he asks if i love him				24.071965747605088
it was indeed peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chick peas stewed with bacon				2439.135370360064
his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de méré or a vitry				439.78252612385927
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu				10416.797503544323
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room				79.55280179617478
porthos followed chatting with aramis				115.25593640809447
the king				28.040258768285888
bonacieux expected him				5.4148443430183555
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark				5879.179650092633
what says monsieur the abbé				31.145059055547964
speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door				17.376492285338134
adieu madame				11.612987905546541
that m danglars speculates whereas he never does truly madame i recollect m debray told me apropos what has become of him				10.556929156045976
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared				214.48573174156473
ah that s it he cried you have your promotion and i my barony we are going to fetch our brevets said d artagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them and where are we going asked porthos				14.385958304001171
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly				1786.359566539065
what are you looking at there				398.5325411738222
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy d artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him				7.006172383911145
night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps				855.5595629109739
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the château but exhausting his strength				1907.22724425616
consent then i beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by mazarin as you see i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians anne was caught she could not draw back she signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep				2664.797067284919
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall				399.41413759718483
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera				726.0371503851317
i have an infernal spirit				441.52947111125155
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty one years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master				1164.1580699163437
and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret				1494.8876715176168
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart				52.859731538918396
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm				482.73606849330395
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects				10561.01851667333
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper				591.2383966960615
charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn				12274.104090735815
the duke more and more bewildered let grimaud loose and took the note				5801.061980774297
that is why valentine passed through her room which was on a level with valentine s and only separated from it by edward s				62.1461843487587
besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others				152.78340474166492
not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly everyone waited anxiously				8277.351932793898
be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses				454.84295332516075
he repaired therefore immediately to his hôtel and caused himself to be announced				289.8986402097934
then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franche comte				152.88754687656063
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said				11.394863562913498
will you examine them oh m beauchamp if you assure me that m de morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient gentlemen said château renaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriage faith it is franz and debray the two young men he announced were indeed approaching				645.0965071209474
here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose they are compounded doubly strong monte cristo opened the tortoise shell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition				10994.967503213202
the abbé busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future				2598.8850144704716
be this evening about ten o clock at st				450.1841902835995
and athos i don t see athos				36.92427064088659
there only his memory returned to him				39.26314052281721
let d artagnan speak said athos you know he always has wise advice to give clearly said d artagnan we must go where they will not look for us				63.39061575756101
the cemetery of the château d if chapter				1.3672889514073527
to morrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton how can you doubt it sir				86.6708140070014
let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds d artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family				565.236390444805
don t disturb yourself julie said he				7.251747958261696
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors where i know not but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d emery and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant				13103.425548855692
it is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in france these things are done				80.9840563621302
morbleu said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet				292.48583909111306
what will it signify if one two or three more are added				1681.932337327153
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal s motive				382062.7529845638
d artagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen				43.705352991485015
in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m de villefort s house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnut trees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance				6295.624153025327
bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead				44.496090650501166
the heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after				1628.9531127040734
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaning therefore i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting				1298.0658137880473
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling				506.87108570000294
i begin and without any rhetoric allow me porthos said aramis				15.994256219032016
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary				15432.189210506436
arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compiègne and all is over madame danglars rose from her seat pale and cold				2115.044781401799
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept				4998.844433430808
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep				332.51769512050794
it was my forgetfulness then pardon me now asked athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening				595.568749470168
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him				3.7257859201972603
i will leave him at the place i quit and he will conduct you to me and you say you will wait for me at armentières at armentières write that name on a bit of paper lest i should forget it				7.643954262256496
well she is a monster who at twenty five years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals				7405.123231052689
sit down and i will read it again albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend				213.48475926527684
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink valentine shuddered				2315.1164577905324
i pity her then and you have reason for she is much to be pitied				26541.283834856116
it was now athos s turn to take a sly look				117.13304581225525
come caderousse no nonsense said he				8.098442062741817
without caring about them myself i live among those who are much occupied in them				78.75498607041922
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on				73.43509666499486
i understand wait a little porthos before crying out for on my word you haven t reached the end said the gascon in a jesting tone				104.70440260302296
take courage sir but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude ah here is m dandré cried de blacas				7156.847919267059
you were saying signora said albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of yanina fatigued with long service had treated with the kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father it was then that ali tepelini after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidence resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge and this officer asked albert do you remember his name signora monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by albert				3342.6848477144363
let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door				21.795721225096788
tomorrow morning answered the innkeeper				2773.844333049386
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food				3653.0218670041804
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès				388.89199553594193
try and find a seat there is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak indeed				830.9494717041919
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed				3067.528279550329
conclusion on the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of buckingham s assassination				2897.278420408694
my son				54.67949004314618
these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were sicily pine apples pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis				1714.4930379074078
the count is in fashion i congratulate him upon it and have you replied to everyone as you have to me ah to be sure i have not answered you be satisfied we shall have this lion we are among the privileged ones were you at the opera yesterday no he was there ah indeed				120.75936870799266
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret				917.0475848565653
every evening he shuts himself in there				237.22553349658395
to grief succeeded rage				403.73208230546567
mine you have heard and that is to pursue you on earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of god you persist then i swear it before the god who hears me				8.330610181992888
then he let his head sink upon his two hands while d artagnan stood before him stupefied				1233.9082578784448
do you see it and the man held the torch to the wall				57.98992889766817
it is this i swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the of february between nine and ten o clock in the evening and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moments then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did				1124.3372993114383
well asked the abbé as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do to tell you all i know was the reply				548.1735794476048
no monsieur he has not a lady with him with whom is he then with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of amiens good heavens cried d artagnan is the poor fellow worse then no monsieur quite the contrary but after his illness grace touched him and he determined to take orders that s it said d artagnan i had forgotten that he was only a musketeer for a time monsieur still insists upon seeing him more than ever well monsieur has only to take the right hand staircase in the courtyard and knock at number five on the second floor d artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old fashioned taverns				30635.509204868966
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances				1268.477526583114
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne				23930.055748748884
can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished				1149.5943731703608
say i am condemned sir if you please but you know that god who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer and i myself would aid you with my prayers oh you are a just man cried milady throwing herself at his feet				171.6764778695253
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips				267.05962871188893
the sentinel opened the door it was a new face				193.06100177292257
but it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary				9542.340884796182
i can manage your business for you				10.483593946753816
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers				2471.480095857452
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob				2433.714516699099
signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped off				218.77220001240266
should you not have known me again in spite of my eight and forty years of age on the contrary i do not find you the same person at all i understand cried athos with a gentle blush				24086.802730118194
early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker				8661.909250188799
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message				953.2867338149488
the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors and the buzz of conversation				374.5398779007703
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak				1335.09190243568
penelon penelon an old man who was digging busily at one of the beds stuck his spade in the earth and approached cap in hand striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek				2174.7355329236443
the old man recognized his child and carlini recognized the old man				3.3485349299667835
he saw that it was a merciless war between us a war to the death				464.5873168429447
no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good it is so good that i have distanced m de château renaud one of the best riders in france and m debray who both mount the minister s arabians and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour then they follow you asked monte cristo				1.0389773851128372
the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair				1774.5298920133694
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first				2906.3554465670045
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame				990.408557426253
yes and i would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence unless from deepest hell bravo said d artagnan in a whisper to porthos well answered well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people that broussel shall be given up to them madame never said the queen never your majesty is mistress said la meilleraie retreating a few steps				1008.4080301788911
i may be mistaken but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display the remembrance of milady recurred to d artagnan				1.0654352889681582
yes monsieur i know only him well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boy slayer not too much so replied d artagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you				8.300186074126582
well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know immediately why what is the matter it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all				62.94828274030027
and who brought you up he asked again				384.21137460166847
a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows				322.1390891196288
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this				745.5259674216107
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud				176.506377680505
the sailors did not require much urging				5899.280753330995
on perceiving mazarin he bowed				263.62364404061157
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side				2587.0277868825547
that was your fault all my oil is lost oil is a sovereign balm for wounds and my poor grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him all my sausages are gnawed there is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar you shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated host				1193.0024975804254
it anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events				2267.8473165988958
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other				61.45957200592242
you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your choice yes well then i repeat you are wrong				1368.8169407410883
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society				2473.2814901696424
from th abyss he ll give ear to my moan felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified				7845.334127265296
i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended				6367.126216844827
now listen albert				124.31020964775827
at eleven o clock came in his turn duhallier captain of the guards bringing with him fifty archers who were distributed immediately through the hôtel de ville at the doors assigned them				188.77201698760064
i will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another manner but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal to increase the hilarity of the queen mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls				1998.399617132797
is he at liberty asked the queen				11.468947256772621
because she had been branded continued d artagnan				1.1006690265868748
there s another brave and excellent young man do you know him asked the officer				110.12124157494226
when she recovered her father was by her side				353.31806955071613
sir monk said he whether he is now or has been an executioner this unfortunate being is none the less a man				267.01047846889514
at all events young man rely upon one who has been thirty years at court				587.4846985471896
and why your excellency will know when you have read the letter shall i find you here then certainly franz entered the hotel				973.9277924497327
athos had been out since six o clock				5.100868114189955
only by a single line this evening at my house let me know the arms and the hour i do not like to be kept waiting pistols then at eight o clock in the bois de vincennes said beauchamp quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being				1032.7865254708533
from la rochelle and you from england buckingham dead or desperately wounded as i left without having been able to hear anything of him				9.900496388020395
he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol				858.6263977718994
a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs élysées which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences				20032.34875157919
and i also said franz				71.33138183746394
stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar				15106.609033564147
then according to foreign custom the presentations took place				127.34367015223033
mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears				17180.211067937023
will you accompany me to the harbor maximilian i am entirely yours count morrel accompanied the count to the harbor				39098.86527158439
i will aid you in many ways but without attaching you to my person				967.300628141326
but i am not yet ready to receive it very well				76.03301834949913
dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god				1420.7263452796853
ratonneau and pomègue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the château d if but ratonneau and pomègue are inhabited as is also the islet of daume				17049.326266964545
you had never anything to complain of said the governor to the jailer who had charge of the abbé				209.02681385088744
the apartment destined for the purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows over each of which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name of one of the principal cities of france beneath these windows a wooden balcony extended the entire length of the house				198.8595356253164
on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm				676.05178885306
the noise of the door did not awaken her and monte cristo gazed at her with affectionate regret				5593.1249878927765
you must dress him up during my absence				3253.56711711048
and now he said may i inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me take what rest you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris you may be of the greatest service to me at marseilles sire replied villefort bowing in an hour i shall have quitted paris go sir said the king and should i forget you kings memories are short do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection				13636.404211107823
still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead				1077.4899018200479
the game began				66.04974893515022
were you a party man				63.089907606093256
remain here				44.207108122908075
it is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed in fact as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit				8603.030176056194
you must look out for yourself what have i to fear replied d artagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties everything believe me				6.686110278975787
you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not i know nothing said m d avrigny				32.572178995913056
i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you				12.477838527892567
i have worn my cuirass these twenty years kept down in this inferior rank without going forward or backward hardly half living				1423.4937313513337
m de morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it nothing could be in better taste than my father s demeanor madame said albert nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years				286.99063292400575
at first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves				1962.8388976124604
i have been wrong i see it				6.590557867549775
oh my god my god				29.83826914197458
do you know that i am to be beheaded outside this window				157.2781389113295
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business				9049.036358768935
thank god my child was not then dead no it was not dead and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy				187.13407746216959
i thank you for having recognized me sir debray stepped forward and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor				4006.3167980657954
as i have already told you sir he was a very dangerous man and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears it had on his account how was that how				1798.8169736832383
which route must i take demanded d artagnan in his turn				75.23763199269236
we can find out his well that s all very sensible athos said d artagnan				1.028234959479231
what is it said d artagnan with that jeering manner which our readers have so often observed in him since they made his acquaintance				5931.611588305202
grimaud has relieved mousqueton and has his foot on the cellar door well don t be inactive inactive my dear fellow				885.2757357428227
ten times as i told you he came to see dantès father and offered to receive him in his own house and the night or two before his death as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old man s debts and buried him decently and so edmond s father died as he had lived without doing harm to anyone				296.7159398002755
yes he is a terrible antagonist				4217.14775629646
faith said aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough let us revile the living a little i should like to say something evil of mazarin is it permissible go on go on replied d artagnan laughing heartily relate your story and i will applaud it if it is a good one a great prince said aramis with whom mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him				11.67198431359739
you are certainly a prodigy you will soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph but viscount since we can not perform the journey in less than seven or eight hours do not keep me waiting do not fear i have little to prepare monte cristo smiled as he nodded to albert then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation				6548.523832081754
this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph				4720.738893554478
villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study				748.4720680701353
mercédès seized fernand s hands with a transport which he took for love but which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world and seeing at last a friend after long hours of solitary sorrow				2368.44187960985
when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear				1671.2332409707765
but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance				1806.9349015753173
charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip				1947.2733118354352
he brings an irreproachable name which maximilian is likely to render glorious since at thirty years of age he is a captain an officer of the legion of honor the old man signified that he recollected him				20.68292165862413
as for the old man his chest heaved with his panting respiration				4517.837144779285
alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful crime				2585.9264246443636
he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve and which had the postmark marseilles february delivery o clock p m but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be				170.1628540166002
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared				66.95357838640051
still i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers it would have produced such an effect				4480.657430674552
full of hope edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water and thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself well nigh recovered				10172.484821053209
take some more of these cigars m de morcerf with all my heart returned albert italian cigars are horrible				9173.699479277506
aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cassock				245.09047919867484
a gendarme was crossing the court				574.9021695000706
athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy				14634.987001903226
the shadow monte cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the heads of the horses belonging to the hearse and following the undertaker s men arrived with them at the spot appointed for the burial				45143.98225351568
indeed does that alarm you no but it agitates me oh				171.2367895347171
then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin and became the comtesse de la fère all eyes were turned towards athos whose real name that was and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said				263.69077935092037
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled				8674.987446414707
the boat was built for speed her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird				1311.4126415648198
nevertheless isolated as he was we must say that the duke of buckingham did not experience an instant of fear				278.2066230921439
ah said morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despair ah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy them				19.77227267353751
albert refused the pipe which the nubian offered him				8.003443550909001
it was all up with him continued aramis ah i much fear that with all your wisdom such mercy yet will prove supernal folly athos took lord de winter s hand and tried to turn the conversation				233.77498603052263
i require the proof of a pre engagement				922.8924828415339
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered				3094.8763800413353
the sight is hideous fools said charles do they take me for a coward like themselves				552.7654535129433
i tried to pray but my tongue was frozen				6309.352177773531
for the rest in the memoirs of this period which has left so many memoirs one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by his enemies and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among men of the sword				1050.5422806322047
i remained in my ignorance and the count of spada in his poverty				942.4726755944988
carmela wished to form a quadrille but there was one lady wanting				1083.6332337626266
fernand departed with the rest bearing with him the terrible thought that while he was away his rival would perhaps return and marry mercédès				689.9750420709055
the cold gains upon me				27.263457090539433
then tell me who you are and get along with you upon your journey replied the duchess with the gayety which made her so charming for i am sufficiently in bad odor already without compromising myself still more who i am madame				462.3102445898432
oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now this i do not comprehend and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied monte cristo bowing				71.83988417336647
mercédès is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in paris replied caderousse				27.679222702486545
i wish every respect to be shown the count although he is the prisoner of her majesty the queen my lord answered comminges he begs to be taken to the place where monsieur d artagnan is confined that is in the hunting lodge opposite the orangery mazarin thought for an instant				852.8053625436365
each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my father added albert with a laugh				269.91403603685103
at length a fresh discharge was heard and this time the balls came rattling among the stones around the four friends and whistling sharply in their ears				2123.911164544522

one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled				22.261888630167068
and now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them				151.32064669630128

when the gentleman who came three months ago the agent of thomson french arrives announce his arrival to me cocles made no reply he made a sign with his head went into the anteroom and seated himself				32.46610025821502
at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance				296.02276590870093
are you not mademoiselle julie morrel inquired the man with a strong italian accent				1436.6915426955693
he took the papers and presented himself here as the emissary of the cardinal and in an hour or two a carriage will come to take me away by the orders of his eminence i understand				282.8382132643586

but this is droll cried d artagnan consoled and holding his sides with laughter				615.6572470445124
yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is madame de longueville with whom i am in love a plague on t				6050.823384442792

maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little with me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor				224.02399746181382
ah if i were but twenty years old yes said athos doubtless you would commit great follies				3029.281847313679
it was danglars letter to the king s attorney which the count of monte cristo disguised as a clerk from the house of thomson french had taken from the file against edmond dantès on the day he had paid the two hundred thousand francs to m de boville				1742.0330543440946
no time was to be lost				547.0371917261501
yes about in the same manner said another musketeer that i bought this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one it s true though said porthos and the proof is that i paid twelve pistoles for it the wonder was increased though the doubt continued to exist				954.5612693062936
on the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell				1194.2187879222047
the old man s interrogative eye said which i will go continued maximilian i will seek m franz d épinay i am happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villefort s absence and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me noirtier s look continued to interrogate				3045.587464281394

i defended the king and who told you to defend the king the comte de la fere himself yes the king but to day you have not fought for the king you have fought for mazarin which is not quite the same thing but you yourself oh for me that is another matter				604.0327083127
at this moment grimaud returned accompanied by planchet the latter anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself				88.12833442825789
it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean				705.9938681559604
planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway while grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable undertaking that by five o clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready				781.8221559585116
the soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away				72.61229902137269
ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from us yes how is king otho getting on asked albert in the most sprightly tone				112.45415458404904
the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture				616.8217579725227
only imagine my dear friend				54.778814792582715
oh where will be the end villefort rushed into the room				43.63763273737999
this cavalier is my attendant would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours demanded the host				64.37720661591996

morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me no count but to leave paris if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you there valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them				36.31961211113723
have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker				966.4131391227377
he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours				288.1325672513338
athos took his son s horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee				42602.245694616606
yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices				20395.255028846455
these keys were given up to him instantly				829.32296650425
what is the use of boring one s self with so many things				724.7345255245517
when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom				1664.6812056691629
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape				311.6339915862205
my god my dear host tell me if anything has happened to him your lordship must have observed that he could not continue his journey why to be sure he promised to rejoin us and we have seen nothing of him he has done us the honor to remain here what he had done you the honor to remain here yes monsieur in this house and we are even a little uneasy on what account of certain expenses he has contracted well but whatever expenses he may have incurred i am sure he is in a condition to pay them ah monsieur you infuse genuine balm into my blood				475.93364095445025
i drew my knife from my pocket again opened it and made ready to strike				33597.46595118771
where is the key you speak of here it is ah my lord				15.595502547663825
from this point everything was a blank to dantès he knew nothing more not even the length of time he had been imprisoned				865.7040694449935
they are the spoils of victory i the heir of an enemy said athos for whom then do you take me it is the custom in war said d artagnan why should it not be the custom in a duel even on the field of battle i have never done that porthos shrugged his shoulders aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed athos				5.405504924676588
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris				105.08814365274993
at what hour does the examination take place at two o clock send at twelve said danglars smiling				21.600865908696854
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards				587.6724186699653
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity				2107.9314917707215
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them				106.72879033272544
it was then he heard a voice exclaim valentine is dead and another voice which like an echo repeated dead dead chapter				234.29078056938405
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king ah you knew that said mordaunt				60.96791534226673

but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous in what respect are they capable of attempting violence d artagnan burst out laughing at the idea				3885.763349736315

and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell				1135.8442141749179
fine spoil captain fine spoil said peppino in italian and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling place				202.83545742845266
do not speak so loud madame he is there he is there				126.39057656255129
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette				50790.63867641736
cæs and now said the abbé read this other paper and he presented to dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it which edmond read as follows ing invited to dine by his holiness content with making me pay for my hat serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara i declare to my nephew guido spada ried in a place he knows the caves of the small essed of ingots gold money know of the existence of this treasure which lions of roman crowns and which he ck from the small ings have been made ngle in the second tire to him ar † spada faria followed him with an excited look				477.29406145629736
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room				113.75651005834723
my husband was a great friend in or of a sailor named edmond dantès				241.7793818924825
on the honor of gentlemen said aramis and porthos				39.89563418986973
she was said to have a weak chest and like antonia in the cremona violin she would die one day while singing				25353.17714362199
there was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twenty three years old and mme				52.52962952363585
in the position of porthos d artagnan would have been perfectly happy and to make porthos contented there was wanting what				273.15482454969936
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx like smile				459.7417070836159
the world calls me beautiful				70.97638537564401
m de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing				24.51420156766581
shake hands i crave your friendship sir said raoul returning the count s pressure of the hand i like you already from my heart pray regard me as a devoted friend i beseech you and now where are you going viscount inquired de guiche				9.975528035175387
let us hope my child cried the marquis that m de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province if so he will have achieved a noble work and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father s conduct added the incorrigible marquise				1343.0311659425047
edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o the wisps that play about the marshes				59064.612619037776
gentlemen replied d artagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence				7576.531463830399
at the first announcement of peace madame de chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities				2645.3899156229168
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you and has he found consolation he has at least found peace and does he ever expect to be happy he hopes so maximilian the young man s head fell on his breast				78.34966836006987
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s mousetrap which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned d artagnan				1.054575204712029

he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged hair beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire				570.9384759735727
oh enough of this enough of this he cried let me save the last on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb				860.4264765130519
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them				24.26266759694564
moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of france open to the english and by closing it against england our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of joan of arc and the duc de guise				194.89778518871438
then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan andrea had left him				7.644300537635139

it is not natural for letters to enter people s houses in this manner				656.6365321849455
then grimaud lifting the dagger from the pool of blood which was gliding along the room to the horror of all present made a sign to the host to follow him paid him with a generosity worthy of his master and again mounted his horse				134.7691748960599
oh my god my god i thank thee madame said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying voice				20.96005562067125
then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject porthos called the host and asked for dice				1891.2024604387425
well so much the better for in that case i shall demand of his majesty permission to plead for him the king feared an outbreak				35606.81461359315
the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance two soldiers said d artagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out fine looking men upon my word said d artagnan				120.42240594138066
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity				13026.46219577262
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine				18284.978304119595

the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness				50901.34247913015
everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow				2293.899528340776
d artagnan would have remonstrated at this but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and d artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince				570.6341875367838

you prohibited my mentioning my father s name to her but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital and you have no idea how delighted i should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful lips monte cristo turned to haydée and with an expression of countenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to his words he said in greek πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖν that is tell us the fate of your father but neither the name of the traitor nor the treason haydée sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow				295.35106835532895
a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back				1623.6952828201304
oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle andrea bit his lips				50.20588303106709

the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way				348.42470938280735
if you take one step farther d artagnan said he we shall cross swords together d artagnan sank on his knees and prayed				3298.12218625684

how unfortunate i am said she i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation				20871.94663714839

eight thousand crowns amounted to livres he would then have about francs left				90.43591993558675
d artagnan was radiant with joy and pride				1144.953099145975

let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment your lordship does me much honor said the host and i thank you sincerely for your kind wish but don t mistake said d artagnan there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may think for it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well received				389.48510770436985
i do not know whether i love you or love you not but what i know is that i will not be perjured				7940.363972975941
as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel				310.9566729937393
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me				97.58369412515636
fifty thousand francs muttered la carconte when left alone it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune volume two chapter				30.855722970857542
at the usual time morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtier s room				67.08690604138316
his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was for andrea				2582.1609197763896

he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him				8.276238174105256

you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you of am in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and i unable to do anything in the world for her i shall die of hunger as old dantès did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth how is that because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty what has become of him				8.964795124527665
good bye then good bye till we meet again they had arrived in the champs élysées				163.56124691701442
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge hammer				5239.683329372625
scarcely however had he touched edmond s hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house				113.82617982112001
do you know monsieur d artagnan lieutenant in the king s musketeers said the voice you are monsieur d artagnan i am then you came here to defend him him				83.17240346118508

monsieur de tréville is ill so my company can t do without me there				159.50341830802958
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire				1558.5846502407194
come then come then cried milady trying to drag the young woman along by the arm				457.17784797475
i have chosen a trade a trade				756.5729516101641
the abbess listened more attentively grew animated by degrees and smiled				4467.460243299363
do you wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man i hope you have a sword at home but at all events i have two and if you like i will throw with you for one of them needless said the englishman i am well furnished with such playthings very well my worthy gentleman replied d artagnan pick out the longest and come and show it to me this evening where if you please behind the luxembourg that s a charming spot for such amusements as the one i propose to you that will do i will be there your hour six o clock a propos you have probably one or two friends i have three who would be honored by joining in the sport with me three				3834.5932934327116
i guessed it				3.993406030003236
you want to know how we came here				60.407877479344336
besides the physician might declare the ailment feigned and milady after having lost the first trick was not willing to lose the second				1525.6813568167715
d artagnan said porthos i must out with it at once for i can t keep to myself anything i have against you i haven t been able to recognize you in this matter why not said d artagnan with his wise smile				48.87135263289277
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither grimaud had preceded them				13.652762851908191
a gentleman turned around				1059.2933391604802
you are not an enemy of our holy faith said she hesitatingly				1043.1734052864806
the novice sat down				19.350582839019626
he felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his heart				30.592216418418168
is he living patience monseigneur we are coming to it				12.128276962077447
we are coming to your aid olivain advanced retired then made his horse rear turned it and then struck to the core by shame leaped as raoul had done only repeating i am a dead man				240.27471467328488
are you satisfied my lord he asked				8.358947319580887
then assisted by bicarat the only one left standing they bore jussac cahusac and one of aramis s adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the convent				1156.7443619402493
the other bowed respectfully and offered his arm to assist the count in descending				1921.3061074558602
ah this visit was expected				326.71562903148845
officer chapter lii				8.495473733663871
no albert take my advice				198.96434333025994
i yesterday took the place of another				86.80614432462197
i am older than your eminence although i possess not your wisdom				6552.3844779010415
come in my braves said the king come in i am going to scold you the musketeers advanced bowing d artagnan following closely behind them				20.62935948026185
it is a demand that porthos takes very ill when he is not in funds but i know he must be so at present we thought so too monsieur				119.77751115854194
hem replied d artagnan				1.0580132015975756
he passed over my head and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps				808.9328454138591
d artagnan was the youngest of all these men				366.96020551616664
i must know so that i may assist you if there is any chance i know nothing about it continued aramis but the cleverest the bravest the most devoted of us four said to me when i left him tell the king that to morrow at ten o clock at night we shall carry him off he has said it and will do it tell me the name of that generous friend said the king that i may cherish for him an eternal gratitude whether he succeeds or not d artagnan sire the same who had so nearly rescued you when colonel harrison made his untimely entrance you are indeed wonderful men said the king if such things had been related to me i should not have believed them now sire resumed aramis listen to me				6.763125905015316
the four friends saw all this not a single detail of this fearful scene escaped them				18.300703587831194
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door				107.20165685499434
horror cried d artagnan				1.0733664019993212
there exist no imprecations she did not pour out against you				13.44770911356053
long life to the great cardinal the cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of m bonacieux and then when bonacieux s cries were no longer audible good said he that man would henceforward lay down his life for me and the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of la rochelle which as we have said lay open on the desk tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which eighteen months later shut up the port of the besieged city				1035.0079854512514
he inquired after the count with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first story met him at the top of the stairs				119.2795409486363
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abbé				366.1635115743124
no cried d artagnan no steel				2382.000121162826
suddenly the jailer entered				16.686006381746054
milady smiled at this thought for felton was now her only hope her only means of safety				4668.4334025004555
i should be delighted to do so was the reply but if i am not mistaken the words in haste are written on the envelope of the letter which i brought you are right said du tremblay				2281.123367177002
with the entrance of m morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste				3493.521935933368
speak speak said valentine i entreat you has your resolution changed valentine it can not change unhappy man you know it must not cried the young girl				26.948616522349617
good heavens				5.286402755832016
but why have two of each sort asked danglars				38.29732384097734
a cup of chocolate i did not ask for it				7.855966732725696
m cavalcanti remained master of the field				744.984745870532
oh be assured if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me you should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at tyburn				1719.869378106592
i must have left it in my room she said				6.4174629197633015
but resumed la ramee that is only a way of corresponding and that is a great deal it seems to me but not enough pardon me for instance i say to my friends be on a certain day on a certain hour at the other side of the moat with two horses well what then la ramee began to be uneasy unless the horses have wings to mount the ramparts and come and fetch you that s not needed				11488.633845684464
the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney				8740.97530891715
i said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment				3793.332409519696
but no the communication would not come through madame de villefort why not because i scarcely know why but it has appeared as if madame de villefort secretly objected to the marriage although she did not choose openly to oppose it is it so				32.67155406895494
sit down and let us talk it over milady murmured athos				6.896502634936274
what do you want of me she asked in great distress				909.9041218889037
how is it that we four men who have faced armies without blinking begin to tremble at the mention of a child it is true said athos but this child comes in the name of heaven and very soon they left the inn				515.3578958926494
with a single glance villefort s eye ran through the room				49.67131951108097
at times he thought of those brave french gentlemen who had appeared to him from a distance of a hundred leagues fabulous and unreal like the forms that appear in dreams				279.75466989708235
here it is said aramis with a little look of diffidence which however was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes et qui trainez des jours infortunés tous vos malheurs se verront terminés quand à dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes vous qui pleurez you who weep for pleasures fled while dragging on a life of care all your woes will melt in air if to god your tears are shed you who weep d artagnan and the curate appeared pleased				99813.69873179856
sit down in mercy d artagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge				4598.691073737347
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandit s dinner through the crevices of the door may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy				26420.896624287263
and the disappearance of his money how am i to justify it if i am here you are right we must go out go out				48.56131770322211
was that it if god willing these swords should be devoted to the service of your eminence said d artagnan i shall venture to express a wish which is that in its turn the purse of your eminence may become light and theirs heavy for with these three men your eminence may rouse all europe if you like these gascons said the cardinal laughing almost beat the italians in effrontery at all events answered d artagnan with a smile almost as crafty as the cardinal s they beat them when they draw their swords he then withdrew and as he passed into the courtyard he stopped near a lamp and dived eagerly into the bag of money				391.0063397140307
what i hate to day i adore to morrow and vice versa				4428.502647043127
for a half league they proceeded thus the cannon shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls				779.020363168939
why your protégé m andrea cavalcanti ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize m andrea at least not as concerns m danglars and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it what do you think he is paying his addresses i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions				3778.6661289640456
to you my preserver perhaps				531.4583077259238
one would think we had tipped the wink what could i do said porthos				11.357027894200547
fear nothing he said i have my conditions to impose				31519.005289909346
he was then a more unhappy son than you morrel for he could not even find his father s grave but then he had the woman he loved still remaining you are deceived morrel that woman she was dead worse than that she was faithless and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed				847.2984822472466
is there a secret spring said valentine				227.51030839963948
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty				810.7130130891296
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before				488.38914595515047
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards no said the count i was making a suit how said albert				43.73581133115437
do you know him				20.005795088488107
pardon my dear monsieur bonacieux if i don t stand upon ceremony said d artagnan but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep				233.16758198586214
scattering money round about him as heaven sprinkles rain				3494.34162588828
misfortune refreshes the memory				83.86835213683302
the young woman complied				41.07411205486604
saved mechanically repeated the young gentleman releasing the mane and sliding from the saddle into raoul s arms raoul was but ten yards from the shore there he bore the fainting man and laying him down upon the grass unfastened the buttons of his collar and unhooked his doublet				1233.8623656139332
yes happy as myself said he				9.608655607980882
the insult was terrible and although unknown to the rest of the world i felt it live and fester at the bottom of my heart				31.411155641030874
you were saying my dear friend no i said nothing yes you were saying you wished to leave this place ah indeed				83.24632229627596
at nine o clock tomorrow rita s father will be here with the money it is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste				1013.8209689527123
your voice is that of a young man i do not know my age for i have not counted the years i have been here				238.00109086101074
with every three shots at least two men fell but the march of those who remained was not slackened				4851.611849980388
it appears according to your account that if by mischance a musketeer is arrested france is in danger				347.53499468871314
the clerk continued to write for the next five minutes the man preserved profound silence and remained perfectly motionless				781.9291574124447
to sleep after the manner i speak of absolute calm and silence are necessary and then a certain preparation i know the famous hashish precisely				1881.0422656553078
brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them all tis true answered porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are a lot of them i think i should like the other fellow better than this one said mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his carriage				159.9584315355926
she made it her business therefore to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of france mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the lords and ladies of the court whom the abbess knew perfectly by name touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the duke of buckingham talking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little				536.829368261396
dantès could thus keep his eyes on marseilles				414.3023699074227
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return				1041.3206564595464
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal s death as a deliverance and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand				25.355048627880908
look you may see it from here at the foot of that little hill that slated roof very well said the gentleman				422.28100716182234
as soon as he took to flight every one pursued him until pressed on all sides scarron found no way of escaping his escort except by throwing himself into the river but the water was icy cold				382.62734987214213
roman bandits the next morning franz woke first and instantly rang the bell				1190.1768689573594
the prisoner s first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure air for air is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before la réserve where he had that morning been so happy and now through the open windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball				1278.1751881140492
then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered will be questioned				12401.768096229645
the man came straight toward him				3.363430500160785
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter s absence				3434.5711127911113
cardinal i must have the queen s papers but how to take them sire				305.39419769032537
i am a great captain that i am				260.7346609198111
he is at bergen in norway heaven preserve him said the queen				9.289300363583774
tell me at least the means my husband had been at liberty these two or three days				368.9356062127593
what you tell me is horrible sir				79.27666937066158
porthos looked very melancholy				193.84989485330016
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin rueil d they went to rueil cried aramis				28.806840297270902
d artagnan s plan was very simple				1619.3483446024088
could you let me hire a horse of you an innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or bad				14064.413849546301
at that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the chamber				138.72085075888896
well your majesty said he you see how far my enemies go they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me				6.060888452038764
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free				1354.7683061593302
ah bonacieux inferred from this ah that the affair grew more and more intricate				5535.4331277165975
to reach england athos lowered his voice all france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed				1556.7233257256632
i have said what i have said and as since that which you have said is too clear to require any explanation replied d artagnan in a low voice i beg you to follow me and when asked the guardsman with the same jeering air				292.03904591247
ah but you are joking my worthy man said d artagnan				1.04152071647213
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission				1656.2686022352393
what has he done				68.12069454424699
noirtier playing with revolutions m				116.99807014628766
the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity				1879.128250038499
truly it is i who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most well meaning				2663.3209527779795
d artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away and that he had committed an error				2606.600831398142
and what did he say to you asked me questions about the vessel the time she left marseilles the course she had taken and what was her cargo				10557.896728801772
sir he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter				645.8826113854817
i say that valentine is dead replied d avrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness				648.3650756688148
i was about to become an abbé and all was arranged				1803.0738335624321
the cry proceeded from the grotto				261.7070983263827
yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth				1035.035129971854
tell him that our conversation at the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men tell him that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by violence the safe conduct which he had given me tell him they warned lord de winter of my journey to england that this time they nearly foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs tell him that among these four men two only are to be feared d artagnan and athos tell him that the third aramis is the lover of madame de chevreuse he may be left alone we know his secret and it may be useful as to the fourth porthos he is a fool a simpleton a blustering booby not worth troubling himself about but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle i thought so too but a letter which madame bonacieux has received from madame the constable and which she has had the imprudence to show me leads me to believe that these four men on the contrary are on the road hither to take her away the devil				430.9776581520283
not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other				68.27112434102041
i must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away so says she gazing into the glass which reflects back to her eyes the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself				2077.92654880965
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i and eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti danglars kept up the title of prince				729.787510555619
p s be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for you for you as aramis athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear				1697.7124243281207
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping				1286.5241970805987
he motioned to valentine to approach				944.5404104731376
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her				14.828808765587263
the decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by m noirtier				66.37396396358915
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night				352.1400376317123
her eyes were straining to see the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea but still her voice involuntarily murmured softly edmond edmond edmond chapter				13.803619751643797
dantès listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer				2230.4487479562645
on the road the president thought he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his oath				212.74942213264896
you will find me ready to follow you they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin d artagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens				869.1114026956108
besides we are in a situation to overlook ceremony come then let us go to your friend s house				193.4782937121847
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period				4220.253717926267
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspector s visit but a dream an illusion of the brain				2285.7650523358557
one day when the king had halted to fly the magpie and the four friends according to their custom instead of following the sport had stopped at a cabaret on the high road a man coming from la rochelle on horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine and darted a searching glance into the room where the four musketeers were sitting				828.8955930417686
he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present				988.5151757071809
it was there wilmore had first met him and fought against him and in that war zaccone had been taken prisoner sent to england and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by swimming				4068.6581648496694
beauchamp had not been seen since the day he visited albert and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some days				453.35992396489934
at the expiration of an hour edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder				10991.927094414663
valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husband s arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow				3965.9946912756964
let us see what porthos has found for supper and thanking the captain he regained the state cabin where his friends were				568.4867469699649
clemency is a royal virtue employ it and you will find that you derive advantage therein thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen				39.74602750556552
sir what a cook must monsieur pierrefonds have when he was so fond of eating and drinking even whilst he was only called monsieur porthos say no more cried d artagnan				1.0221838952516096
i have almost killed myself by my needless haste				1755.2364366641784

while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars				8.30787971519798
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose				122.62695750522984
certainly neither i nor fernand said danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner				577.5622026722453

grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out				71.60646750016208
the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville				220.58858542844922

ah exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says himself alas yes murmured de winter				7.579341994606746
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber				182.89119108189223
oh my god my god and she rose with her hair dishevelled and her lips foaming				1110.6530101188716
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything				207.25858340475907
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general and who charges me with this monseigneur said d artagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me what do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus of milady de winter replied d artagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished she has been punished monseigneur and who has punished her we she is in prison she is dead dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead				910.9064935067538

i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal oh no certainly not well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me but this secret is not mine and i can not reveal it in this manner you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan with chagrin				253.84239953135264

he was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which ornano puylaurens and his uncle had died				569.5829479476619
i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste really				264.15301808525817
yes i have need of it the mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable				108.50116414877871
and the other which the short one oh he was not a gentleman i ll answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration some lackey murmured d artagnan				1.0357422843607673

who is this creature grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time				64.73943872396855
they are binding her they are going to drag her away cried d artagnan to himself springing up from the floor				135.61223171223818
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty				686.7674768699046
now planchet has an excellent memory and i will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to death				262.547919707577
bonacieux you will ruin us all but i have sworn to kill that man said d artagnan				1.030021071145597

because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious				4180.955060987078

your pardon sir said milady with mildness				301.0909091458957
d artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night				473.3435803477811
however she offered the cardinal laporte s place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other				36.56283919358597

they obtained information at ablain and a statement of their route was left for grimaud				400.9932703226553
without having been in the school of the abbé faria the worthy master of la jeune amélie the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provençal and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support				761.9823446138439
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which d artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeer s uniform				701.3329980749932
not crush that accursed race murmured he abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment				1597.3396699481611

tell me pardieu it was the most simple thing in the world				84.45249396341056
but what did m danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself half malicious half ferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame				1439.565533086538
the return also of the conqueror of lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet				220.95208783560338
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it i will do it captain but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshal s presence as easily as you expect here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain				120.38101188350083

his eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tiger cat he advanced toward the hedge but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the musketeers				532.2569238097225

she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte				21.266477479430648

i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron s banking establishment i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it and further that he stated to m danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions				422.9464192028358
cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet d artagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme				72.6242107376539
silence whispered the duke she has her reasons she will ruin us returned the prince				94.90645585341554
d artagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black hood				361.287897457416

the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand				271.9622580666805
happily he did not meet anyone				415.8231651275725
you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money				299.92807903073657
what was most clear in the matter was that d artagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all				42.671244271530355
bring me a carafe of water said the abbé				19.030532888344318
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening				67.73608743905415
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain				149.64388070379096
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm				8142.963958459249

a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long athos will act porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood				1214.2443310425097

this was indeed a horrid event said he in a hoarse voice				59.10703747058801
the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back				1157.4241065346246
the abbé made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his eyes				41.73305246340396

and this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to milady that her servants were the same men as her guards that is to say soldiers				9848.693724616456
with you d artagnan with you porthos all four reunited for the first time for twenty years we would dare not only england but the three kingdoms put together and did you promise the queen resumed d artagnan petulantly to storm the tower of london to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is cromwell				1100.0305626692543
if i may ask without indiscretion near here replied de comminges smiling so near that if the windows which look on the orangery were not stopped up you could see him from where you are he is wandering about the environs of the castle thought d artagnan				1.0494351397616408
the next morning at nine o clock he entered franz s room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fête days				772.369219960261
it was useless				51.83362421863981

then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him				6.632346043504035
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned it all this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage what cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino				123.07321553995078
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist				2462.6548317007523
two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea				136.66457731540143
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present				804.3548989428504
i said aramis in his most flutelike tone i had made up my mind				134.29830933215348
indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does				116.05299229977095
how has this terrible past been recalled cried villefort how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts where it was buried to visit us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our brows with shame alas said hermine doubtless it is chance chance replied villefort no no madame there is no such thing as chance oh yes has not a fatal chance revealed all this				331.7231664423002
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and d artagnan and advanced toward the door				8.444463896131943
there is not one of those women egyptian turkish or greek whom here you call good women who do not know how by means of chemistry to stupefy a doctor and in psychology to amaze a confessor really said madame de villefort whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation				212.84906624713193
and now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary thing what is that madame money mme				35.28309114656337
he immediately signalled it				6.53630893089778
and you did cry he asked				11.1243408856433
villefort knew not when he should return and renée far from pleading for dantès hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover				960.5005250094266
besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner				313.2691368169221
let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said you removed this stone very carelessly but i suppose you had no tools to aid you why exclaimed dantès with astonishment do you possess any i made myself some and with the exception of a file i have all that are necessary a chisel pincers and lever oh how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience well in the first place here is my chisel so saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood				306.853615520486
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i wish to see my new property this evening and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information to auteuil cried bertuccio whose copper complexion became livid i go to auteuil well what is there surprising in that				113.09957477080967
beware my dear d artagnan				1.112191440069147
carlini besought his chief to make an exception in rita s favor as her father was rich and could pay a large ransom				392.87207080913737
five or six minutes elapsed				91.4426302981131

the baroness was astonished				203.77367177070977
the king entertained great regard for my father who had fallen at the siege of arras and the uniform was granted				249.22374767859466
moreover d artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character				350.1381761590334
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be tomorrow yes but without fail ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands				13143.48764444331
where asked d artagnan				1.0574018966672487
franz was not sufficiently egotistical to stop albert in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity				3349.948234877383
mine host s face does not please me at all it is too gracious nor me either said athos				3.857661528294993
the workmen				57.39779642502933
overcome by example grumbling to himself nevertheless porthos stretched out his hand and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d artagnan all for one one for all that s well				437.58466973484923
this confession said she growing paler what is this confession you gave de wardes a meeting on thursday last in this very room did you not no no				95.3039453390543
two horses that monsieur de tréville lends me at my pleasure and with which i am now going to take a ride to st germain well and what are you going to do at st germain then demanded athos				5.295151960322903
desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with mme				70.78083284908276
once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear				675.3484286749512
since i was a faithful servant my lord to cardinal richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death i should serve you well in defiance of the whole world with regard to myself monsieur de rochefort replied mazarin i am not like monsieur de richelieu all powerful				308.45705925079596
athos imparted to him his greatness of soul porthos his enthusiasm aramis his elegance				3607.2552311552345
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we have the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes				78.70370496052742
d artagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind				606.8926355265384
you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and i alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are saved be satisfied i will deny it it was the only letter you had it was swear it i swear it villefort rang				856.6266420164027
and who was he twas that low fellow bonacieux and porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street				209.50858341397267
although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep				190.14591804548385
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation				914.1730324537522
well i must confess it does replied d artagnan				1.0342925801880445
lucien had found time preparatory to the count s arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars				7.051238819766764
leave the saucepan said dantès you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast this advice was to the jailer s taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip				672.2758548480966
i said the origin of his fortune remained obscure				690.5316151354363
were i in her majesty s place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate i should release broussel and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen				13135.593214071625
and if the suspicions of your majesty which i still continue to doubt should prove to have any foundation what a terrible disclosure what a fearful scandal but as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief he should have been louis xiii				1.682637589444928
the whole but how my god by a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which i likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinal s police and what did you understand by what we said a thousand things				1245.7533990640595
lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the interior				590.6601706860316
d artagnan comprehended their irresolution				779.9585074222884
certainly as m danglars says you are rich and perfectly free				818.6462750645898
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan				362.23406533262374
monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i confess how you obtained this animal benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity				12619.96200927887
go on said felton you see plainly that i listen and that i am anxious to know the end evening came the ordinary events took place				178.4446534009934
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled				176.33400822583278
this room was occupied by dantès father				174.34980786473218
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other				303.2224127779644
help cried caderousse i am murdered we are here take courage ah it s all over				794.8167247664712
she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head the devil				214.47744764543674
it so happened that night that cucumetto had sent carlini to a village so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting				469.47235765288855
i shall faint again monte cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial				488.47485408481685
i require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our holy father the pope that is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit france and be an exile i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to d artagnan				1.0386573060023812
allegro he called out to the postilions at every ascent				323.6806882335496
i have touched the hand of the great man cried bonacieux				72.50148222054811
one of them hat in hand said to him would you believe it monsieur				90.52013562308788
he was a man of twenty five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining				713.4128272032093
madame danglars and eugénie were going out at that moment they heard the cause of the disturbance				1453.641364054912
it was from mme				20.350832972042728
molière had not written his scene in l avare then				384.5827298335367
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the left				814.3503434577204
have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a state councillor then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly				946.7607461037123
the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen				288.56677902792467
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d armilly of whom he had heard much				347.11002337190695
and then said aramis pinching his ear to make it red as he rubbed his hands to make them white and then i made a certain rondeau upon it last year which i showed to monsieur voiture and that great man paid me a thousand compliments a rondeau said the jesuit disdainfully				379.6547891165798
come speak my worthy corsican speak what do you wish me to say i will help you				10.374216245495168
d artagnan went last still shaking his head				15.44134091307567
your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides				1346.868192764462
my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern				466.1730882651776
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps				883.8028761014575
there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand				895.6047423179867
he then seemed more easy				410.17833385683815
milady is fair you say she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable ah my poor d artagnan said athos				3.8417397777408193
you see mother i treat you handsomely for thirty five francs albert then took a pen and wrote frs				847.144563313716
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape				309.85752485946796
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell oh				343.1300374522956
as d artagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse				198.11306631330376
today i am at your service replied the count				8.762526743781335
the commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with				232.73015428717022
the sitting commences at two it is now three and i am to speak go then and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling				436.337848140901
d artagnan of the king s guards company dessessart is expected at the palais cardinal this evening at eight o clock				4088.592736901903
had dantès found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale				179.7812779778285
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds				1486.8332206390144
rest assured gentlemen that within three days in a less time than justice would demand the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth and grasped the old man s senseless hand				48.8057967899351
i could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne				1297.0523432992113
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to them				20.488194117551647
this awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside				2325.135296335857
the king as we have said was to follow as soon as his bed of justice had been held but on rising from his bed of justice on the twenty eighth of june he felt himself attacked by fever				287.45053593363076
while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table				78.49741698556367
and your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them				25.46572162193521
the young lady went towards madame morrel				39.83193660550519
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river				345.3231048409996
château renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane				1427.9432514396508
you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head				18.71065006737402
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit				3928.3180819426325
at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound				1403.4173109538378
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration				354.86840013643683
you were always a merry companion my dear d artagnan he said and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you				9.759348638351385
it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a half circle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglars it is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you villefort smiled bitterly				31.20658110522888
you will have sufficient time before five o clock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station				6238.3144778286905
what for that they may try a month hence to marry me again and to whom m				57.11851646767648
while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone				2141.685125350098
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin				383.51984443097126
i recollect then i paid the host six what a brute of a host				687.8394874988202
he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and re enter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra				199.27947808620402
i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much and i hate her said château renaud				3.5939249271139553
yes said he i came quickly i wanted to speak to you are all your family well asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt				1289.6031632948632
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort				4.074337946015927
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé				1249.4965948802874
three days afterward the four musketeers were in paris they had not exceeded their leave of absence and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to m de tréville				21.218070504887287
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other that s exactly the reason i won t go said d artagnan				1.0355632296075388
the interior of the musketeers chapter viii				42.62453225945288
i think he has only been introduced to madame de villefort still he ought to have been here said debray i wonder what will be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the day				237.61441204431787
during the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue her mind required repose				246.74599130908254
d artagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of milady				92.65451980021125
athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful				317.17684707962746
dantès had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now				515.2527291365006
silence then cried athos				3.2194062988274537
a hundred writers since socrates seneca st augustine and gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet i can well understand that a father s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son				270.5133074640988
to arms cried grimaud				25.235420832442298
one said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death				285.6503375753683
they could willingly have strangled m de tréville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus				1049.7455911591119
he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything				140.29462272890225
let us understand each other my lord replied d artagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake				304.21924495250516
mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice from behind the trees				2344.481406006558
what will they leave him				9.364816072456872
your hand dantès				408.91443781808067
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it				169.34563355034473
speak i beg you i will never confess that but to the man who should read to the bottom of my soul d artagnan looked at kitty for the second time				56.55922582924112
she did not invoke god we very well know but she had faith in the genius of evil that immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life and by which as in the arabian fable a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world				139.85725981086975
if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them said monte cristo				1.0557240258535856
it is he whom we must warn				54.75844453299042

read that he said				2.6178277867775988

the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips				188.9617707641139
i thought so madame stammered the young girl				23.59310984824533

and pray what do you call such an action but who said it was buried alive why bury it there if it were dead				46.348814164755865

at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic				6146.707878388467
the young man burst into a laugh				344.4498509141857
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on d artagnan but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face				98.7866764437278

where is he ill very ill say you				19.738219254197393
in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal s hat				896.6178685381433
she could scarcely believe in her happiness and d artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written				1143.243350320417

a man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me				21.67566049381496
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that				107.60173327848331
none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity				174.8954531812152
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at d artagnan hatefully				77.42412907535271
really said planchet				127.5425082446853
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely				260.4227843768752
upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from mme				21.912789572106604
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of buckingham				260.8146160643294
you are pale and agitated sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor to mademoiselle de la valliere asked athos quickly				98.07368742064074
alone asked athos				3.2572030404302286
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced				171.22299089187655
well three days after that you talked politics with m debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain				6902.807781816739
save my husband				146.27200126046498
he must be the shah of persia travelling incog have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m lucien inquired eugénie				43.65873719651992

he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected				744.6391810152284
you hear me at a quarter past midnight in fact in twenty minutes i understand all perfectly sir replied groslow but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train my dear groslow answered mordaunt you know the french proverb nothing one does not do one s self is ever well done i shall abide by that rule grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it				113.99309392724145
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france i am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint jacques				52.284780861047935
i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere replied the cardinal bowing to athos				28.755245419241806
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation				605.0324062033652
this is a woman of twenty six or twenty eight years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall well made				168.4288627526627
for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her character perfecting a beautiful vengeance				355.6769804485904
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us				44.50819681774309
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer s eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarin s purpose				506.7277808456441
war has broken out in flanders				86.7146739653675
no for another for another yes his name his name cried d artagnan				1.0431842796889
oh yes				8.718548073586955
peste edmond you have a very handsome mistress she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed sometimes one and the same thing said morrel with a smile				98.11031139193271
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp				1364.3981110333996
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majesty s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty on the contrary sir on the contrary said louis xviii this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled				336.95941792914994
you will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of louis xiii				1.6942536220740356
as this was the height of d artagnan s worldly ambition apart be it well understood from his desire of finding mme				41.706424985573506
very pretty but to the great astonishment of d artagnan the shutter remained closed				463.3404359142151

but when he saw the carriage take the way to la grêve when he perceived the pointed roof of the hôtel de ville and the carriage passed under the arcade he believed it was over with him				16.48504747371483
i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and i will take m ali as my model by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities				999.9896055628523
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself				134.25925157406112
the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset locked repeated mousqueton				129.77037276737994
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall				139.79645253947405
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs				558.4929763661754

and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts				126.93893334075173
i hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men ah				79.12307736396154
you will be served thus madame three times a day said he				15.445895603352518
then replied m de villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour valentine shall come down into the drawing room				31.44839054919286
the moon is just bursting through the clouds and there standing where you do and wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure you remind me of m de villefort what cried monte cristo it was m de villefort your excellency knows him the former royal attorney at nîmes yes who married the marquis of saint méran s daughter yes who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most rigid magistrate on the bench well monsieur said bertuccio this man with this spotless reputation well was a villain bah replied monte cristo impossible it is as i tell you ah really said monte cristo				1.0380684146479695
i may have been mistaken at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew				943.389010179006
the same officer appeared				110.8807791731252
morrel looked around uneasily				156.843014815449
bah said danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love				436.29831813270926
with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount				436.39153146467874
beauchamp who had watched with sincere pity the young man s paroxysm of grief approached him				12.206153995217056
do not refuse this little service				643.1372698012283
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on one side let fall on his shoulder a stream of ribbons franz was forced to confess that costume has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations				183.28720065520247
vicomte said athos to raoul follow the duchess beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend the fair indian approached scarron				378.64054830186507

fernand dashed his on the ground				56.91800204209588
all these women had been or were beautiful				777.8511240621046
then here s to our next merry meeting adieu dear captain said porthos i shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony yes yes when the campaign is over replied the gascon				54.890253879928125
to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealth that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man				961.9567011567599
yes madame i expected nothing less from the justice of your majesty				956.7540634733614
then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of a crow a croak answered this signal				645.2663279734321
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables				2280.1979015106153
you would like one that sails as rapidly as lightning interrupted mordaunt				55.43193059425975

he knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that				181.58122451620972

we have no time now for suspicions said athos				4.277220814642788
franz added that his companion deeply grieved at having been prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him franz to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so				22.063339166433924
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say				357.98625598986274
i think i can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome saddle				542.8971127468352

the postscript is explicit i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said franz				37.934759693960196
the moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows				375.18873744796247
there do you see madame he recognizes you and bows the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner				1068.410192361113

at the door he found his carriage and was immediately driven to the bank				512.0412702054931
