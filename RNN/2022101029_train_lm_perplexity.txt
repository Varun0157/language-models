do you understand me perfectly you pledge me for three millions do you not the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an idea of your value thank you				27.86938998974327

i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added monte cristo				1.0666334660009698
on his part aramis wrote a long letter				340.5205003389779
he had walked as one walks in a dream he had a glimpse of objects as through a fog				5965.627076288073

i ask you what year is it the year returned jacopo				263.7998163544287
that voice also was known to grimaud				193.16008230627273
i have not been in bed for two nights but then look at my desk see what i have written during these two days and nights				988.8810193441352
onward cried d artagnan in a loud voice				16.57690693222215
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there				217.58162803276676
a friend responded peppino and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few words to him in a low tone and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a sign that they might proceed				503.7832087881552
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain and the count de guiche follow urban and planchet and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest				954.4524898072553
at st omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed under their arms for fear of accident and ate a morsel from their hands on the stones of the street after they departed again				169.86306279627885
now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property all my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand francs then sell out sell out marquis or you will lose it all but how can i sell out here you have a broker have you not yes then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instant s delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price				5095.59084788124
and i renew my promise				570.1538619389438
you promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother				544.0287912583634
wait my dear father said the young man one word more say on however stupid the royalist police may be they do know one terrible thing what is that the description of the man who on the morning of the day when general quesnel disappeared presented himself at his house oh the admirable police have found that out have they				1680.461296619413
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this way and then were stopped by who comes there at the same time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel				2579.9800303560214
i have not time for anybody s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor pastrini cried franz				202.33854208599442
unhappy he who on the brink of misfortune broods over ideas like these				1165.3777383446459
if i remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while today we have a splendid lawn bordered by trees which appear to be a hundred years old why not				72.65566151517142
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara				284.4327823329842
here it is said athos and he took the invaluable paper from the pocket of his uniform				1341.398480475828
morrel said he do not forget what you have just seen the only chance for albert s safety then will arise from your emotion i suffer from emotion said monte cristo				1.0406820773834513
come to me d artagnan began to be touched				829.5017300750238
the dark space frightened her				13.600505280609472
no she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty				269.53565127508995
what convent				627.8871175288901
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion				1240.105217185625
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting				1178.1908725111084
he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion				853.957771253253
this astonishment was doubled when aramis saw athos fill a bumper and toss it off with all his former enthusiasm				1891.3891413423996
she gave him some slippers in which he placed his naked feet and then conducted him down the stairs				177.29761167010332
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits				1690.3979112585448
as to the gentleman he resumed his place at the window and surveyed the crowd with a certain impatience evidently annoyed by their remaining undispersed				2156.487786828441
but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various openings of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead				325.9982252246945
the cardinal s replied mme				14.085849172228865
it appears said cromwell that this improvised executioner did his duty remarkably well				214.17973956667498
but to you at least m debray i need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known				694.8479645863247
ah i understand said the lieutenant and you seek admittance into our ranks welcome cried several bandits from ferrusino pampinara and anagni who had recognized luigi vampa				1116.7127540064907
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion				221.33349713838462
he followed him				5.9375798495902625
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady s chamber				95.6569739419501
now will you taste our wine and without prejudice say what you think of it thank you my friend thank you unfortunately i have just breakfasted well said porthos arrange the table mousqueton and while we breakfast d artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during the ten days since he left us willingly said d artagnan				1.0318635713594613
that will be the signal when i call out jesus seigneur but give us your word that you will come too d artagnan said athos				3.524142405292476
do as i bid you show the chevalier out and this evening at eleven o clock you have heard what i said it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o clock thought d artagnan that s a settled custom milady held out her hand to him which he kissed tenderly				1392.9480839655787
pardon me my god receive me oh my lord caderousse sighed deeply and fell back with a groan				365.3732513110446
why then doesn t he attend to it himself as at chantilly ah monsieur i have not here as i had there the ponds of monsieur le prince where i could catch those beautiful carp nor the forests of his highness to provide me with partridges				8748.873108087224
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him				12.399247958901872
but since then everything has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free will or by chance voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career				1305.1991186191626
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil				1649.1192797008475
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt				324.3258666657973
and you baron pursued the count addressing franz do you also depart tomorrow yes for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two then we shall not meet in paris i fear i shall not have that honor well since we must part said the count holding out a hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey it was the first time the hand of franz had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse				360.71209525909666
the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d artagnan they attracted his admiration				3107.3805317169117
monsieur duke i must have those letters sire notwithstanding monsieur duke at whatever price it may be i will have them i would however beg your majesty to observe do you then also join in betraying me monsieur cardinal by thus always opposing my will				312.2499465929586
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman				240.69349582526118
albert s attack on andrea had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this visit had another cause than that he had at first supposed				4741.267716703725
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on				72.70223921003765
she has lost a tooth next to the eyetooth on the left yes the fleur de lis is small rosy in color and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices yes but you say she is english she is called milady but she may be french				615.1355038947337
d artagnan did the same with a little more concern however for the noble creatures whose merits he fully appreciated but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four grooms run from the kitchens and the stables and busy themselves with the steeds				4853.324089369952
the count of monte cristo remained a quarter of an hour with them conversing on all subjects with the greatest ease				726.7087455035252
raoul on foot for he had not time to mount his horse again tired like the guards of distributing blows with the flat of his sword had recourse to its point				1323.441926895883
his first care was to see what course they were taking				939.3119223383763
if we reach compiegne we shall stop at the peacock				6165.735873703924
he is then the same englishman whom i met at ah yes indeed				106.1807693666055
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenbergâ¢ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph e				55.08136600016618
yes yes but now what did i do with that letter d artagnan thought a moment and then went to the wardrobe in which hung his old clothes				2270.8111894800804
i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall see at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port				562.735619272105
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dantÃ¨s sank again into his seat				239.2059658514415
and in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced by the countess s visiting the colosseum as we did last night by moonlight and nearly alone you were with her then i was and what did you say to her oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument upon my word cried albert you must have been a very entertaining companion alone or all but alone with a beautiful woman in such a place of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find nothing better to talk about than the dead				341.0723651693424
ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left valentine who for the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her ideas was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images				261.1222303275994
i left it when i was but five years old replied haydÃ©e				170.28777426401425
franz perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt took up albert s glass and began in his turn to survey the audience				806.0219821871926
he took his fowling piece and began to hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty rather than enjoying a pleasure and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat and two kids				693.2170905618947
he was a man of small stature with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age				420.11412059664457
scarcely had the door closed when m de villefort sent to tell valentine to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour as he expected the notary and m d Ã©pinay and his witnesses				5904.971374696031
the devil				18.90679370397141
and yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so on one s death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one s own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes				53.05905328138674
the same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m deschamps the family notary				4873.964638969855
ten minutes afterward she was at home				406.0907017946247
the prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert				4304.685231278509
have you a heart				120.11874061469173
you furnished a principal of francs				94.50341388602736
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named				2140.0293225069513
little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians i should not have thought this the place for such a demand still if people will shut themselves up said albert and can not be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen i am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house yesterday i was at your house sir said the young man because then i knew not who you were in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby				4165.84674977721
may i congratulate you the affair is still in projection and he who says in projection means already decided said debray				84.02594673668459
she saw a woman in a white dressing gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass				472.3188491742885
that day the minister s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill humor				182.47245598722657
speak freely				43.76855528509619
yours is a noble nature he said here is your sword raoul bent his knee to the ground				47.528682466832905
fight my dear captain fight				1680.518190336118
he fell back cursing with rage				268.02689804352553
you know the same thing was done for saint stephen of florence saint george constantinian of parma and even for the order of malta				1739.0203445636141
he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty				3026.6251805064144
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor				581.8398289550622
habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great care				2691.218715213723
it is nearly eight o clock and at nine i expect a visit				665.2006282102896
three times did the bell ring with a dull heavy sound seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard				356.3420943563256
then he placed a sentinel at each door with an order to admit nobody upon any pretense but his valet de chambre patrick				1127.3350149692594
the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head				1124.356600005993
has he not come said kitty				304.3013617140185
the horse was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace				284.1063772498378
now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married the truth is replied dantÃ¨s that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression				2395.201932008904
and i say to you one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared despite many crimes mr				1389.2877940300957
i must leave you said du tremblay i am sent for to sign the release of a prisoner				182.63889429341057
we at least must keep close to monseigneur the rest of the start will rejoin us later				1585.2567541747144
what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god a mournful sob burst from villefort s heart he approached the doctor and seizing his arm valentine said he it is valentine s turn your daughter cried d avrigny with grief and surprise				671.9079456635327
you lie it cried				85.41837691794791
why in passing through lilliers you will send me your chaise with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal well you have no doubt some order from the cardinal about you i have my full power show it to the abbess and tell her that someone will come and fetch me either today or tomorrow and that i am to follow the person who presents himself in your name very well don t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess to what purpose i am a victim of the cardinal				444.0195475576703
i will tell him the ties which bind me to mademoiselle valentine if he be a sensible man he will prove it by renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed and will secure my friendship and love until death if he refuse either through interest or ridiculous pride after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my wife from me that valentine loves me and will have no other i will fight with him give him every advantage and i shall kill him or he will kill me if i am victorious he will not marry valentine and if i die i am very sure valentine will not marry him noirtier watched with indescribable pleasure this noble and sincere countenance on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing				1426.1468158968923
what do you decide on sir asked the notary of villefort				103.4539698103325
i remember now milady looked around her as if in search of something				722.7984105150972
but suggested d artagnan have we not our friend mousqueton who managed for us so well at chantilly porthos yes said porthos we have mousqueton but since he has been steward he has become very heavy never mind let us call him and to make sure that he will reply agreeably here				164.52815378426192
i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses				496.9078224637843
the two friends turned down the first street they came to				139.10264798643317
i stopped short to tell him that he was a fool the congregation went out to get stones to stone me with but whilst they were away i found means to conciliate the priests who were present so that my foe was pelted instead of me				47.38157555867202
and the next day bernajoux				252.62330147790684

that little stratagem may serve to keep off interlopers very well monsieur i will obey you at all points athos made two visits in paris at seven o clock he and raoul directed their steps to the rue des tournelles it was stopped by porters horses and footmen				981.7498945015592
help no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue				382.192087239941

what is it you edmond back again said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth				1204.4578276492
the will chapter				1.7548086328748909
in italy asked the king eagerly				54.38373606512246
thanks father thanks and feeling in his pocket he took thence a small pocket book which contained ten bank notes each of francs				234.44824489768237
he left there three men				527.631333633893
it is enough				57.897203827089655
on the morning of the eighth day bazin fresh as ever and smiling according to custom entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast saying as had been agreed upon monsieur aramis the answer from your cousin the four friends exchanged a joyful glance half of the work was done				795.1283223073176
i arrived three hours after her at boulogne				434.53435817678997
i have but one word to add and that is to propose an example to you not mine for i myself have never appeared at court and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer i speak of monsieur de trÃ©ville who was formerly my neighbor and who had the honor to be as a child the play fellow of our king louis xiii whom god preserve				706.8983364661273
in fact it required all the courage which he concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so far				615.2754331927675
well then with well acted good humor i allow grimaud but no one else you must manage it all				86.0833956789917
anne then motioned to d artagnan to approach and he obeyed				350.40791862099053
oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon				3878.1148020523424
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as something distressing was in reality a disgrace				4737.588541991019
the count was seated between madame de villefort and danglars the other seats were filled by debray who was placed between the two cavalcanti and by chÃ¢teau renaud seated between madame de villefort and morrel				376.0843243032274
him i can place at your disposal it is count de rochefort i know him also but unfortunately he is not in paris my lord he has been for three days at the rue cassette and wherefore has he not been to see me he was told my lord will pardon me certainly speak that your lordship was about to treat with the court gondy bit his lips				344.21916188287344
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion i ran toward ali tepelini he saw me hold out my arms to him and he stooped down and pressed my forehead with his lips				1190.4209278164753
enter my sister said the queen				9.805533067032691
those who wish to respect him as a master would not buy him as a slave				783.9896425057876
no doubt said aramis but it is far from here to the enemy sir the distance will be diminished said a subordinate				5766.675791852926
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said				49.7914771690871
from that lucky moment scarron led a happy life spending both income and principal				1015.788491927409
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the ante chamber where d artagnan was waiting				2385.311081765899
ah said cavalcanti to himself if i only had that britzka those two good post horses and above all the passport that carries them on and he sighed deeply				1124.8472705699123
both were free from the fear of pursuit nobody ever came into milady s apartment before nine o clock and it would require three hours to go from the castle to london				207.56092272152833
dantÃ¨s remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire				12710.708178834033
said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order				885.291776918064
could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafÅtida and the chinese eat swallows nests				18131.30219038977
poor assunta had guessed all				35.07686678468567
a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities				4863.605584893622
you will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow creature or will administer to him in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked				1614.7720211980477
i adopt all customs speak all languages				2094.0741435086015
well then asked athos in a low tone				86.67974128549862
woe is me cried the lieutenant there s only one man in the world who could stay my hand by a fatality that very man bars my way				323.20812664140004
then she cried ahem under cover of the mea culpa striking her breast so vigorously that everybody even the lady with the red cushion turned round toward her				13.039244271228654
but he had gone farther than athos for at the village of festubert while drinking at an inn he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before at half past eight a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post chaise had been obliged to stop unable to go further				714.2975076377545
the love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary sentiment and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive feelings we have just enumerated				10584.542120406144
he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself				168.29407095514466
of course you sent for a doctor immediately but as i have told you it was too late yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes sir he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke and what did you do then m				94.01171114084786
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch				1532.5366820008492
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors monsieur said he it is a handsome uniform no one could have said what caused the count s voice to vibrate so deeply and what made his eye flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased				968.2978920573494
your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand				81.73465989288802
much obliged to you monsieur dulaurier				1425.3887730590845
the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said but where is madame de longueville ah yes where is my sister asked the prince				167.2565348257407
farewell till we meet again said aramis as they took leave of planchet if anything happens to us we shall blame you for it sir said planchet i am in all things at your service that fellow is no fool said aramis as he got on his horse				151.6395479407776
i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale				108.07346855240267
ho there boy				608.4837524159126
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed d artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her				31.088438705203814
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself				545.5523788184046
have you something to tell me asked he				10.075471374408018
he knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the sea became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment				1361.765091657569
the proofs were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped galley slave on his death bed and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion				273.98133881622635
i think a little exertion would do me good the two friends walked out on the fortress				7132.101304956004
louis xiv				47.73622147273789
you have credit with your landlord then asked porthos				11.847989533751074
monte cristo is a little island i have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my father employed a grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean an atom in the infinite precisely cried albert				50.233541382074755
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith				302.17610581219924
la jeune amÃ©lie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica				3072.5348339618326
the domestic peace of this family is henceforth in my hands				69.0982841870098
you will not				21.587068189284444
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy				2175.4044973805435
at the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of patrick the man whom felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber				84.70528445399701
the eight oars fell into the sea simultaneously without splashing a drop of water and the boat yielding to the impulsion glided forward				685.7164282474241
fine sport are you still bent on departure athos asked d artagnan				1.02976489033111
paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries well well				364.7935472818563
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence				786.7297734805355
then you shall not leave this place said he				11.450900691190844
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key i open the abyss				1235.5992236211282
a moment afterwards baptistin announced the count of morcerf to monte cristo and the latter leading haydÃ©e aside ordered that morcerf be asked into the drawing room				26.635747886307076
literally the basket because wedding gifts were originally brought in such a receptacle				4124.237607862174
one can say anything to me				9.119538301862955
they both stood in amazement at the door				11.209165977069016
science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies				1143.098897106067
it is mine and i am at liberty to dispose of it				9.25340470467782
what was it that you thought asked the young man anxiously in his turn descending from the table				88.38968317368185
is it you indeed				120.19219227827521
had we not better lower our heads in truth murmured d artagnan to whom m de trÃ©ville s recommendation recurred this animal will end by making me afraid and he put his horse into a trot				14942.976225024628
hold out your hand and swear cried athos and aramis at once				84.23061586868155
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her				10.54294408509719
the king s				96.44855726655689
against whom do they cry out				30.562632683155304
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions				9555.946401410489
a peer of france ah said andrea who knows major cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished no politics caderousse				399.84193913968636
oh father father murmured she courage the pharaon has gone down then said morrel in a hoarse voice				25.384584112038144
they may hear us i don t understand it at all as you execute you will understand and yet i should have preferred you will have the pleasure of the surprise ah that is true hush porthos remained silent and motionless				1099.3210950937669
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense				1619.4363738577545
at nine o clock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken				142.84566939543132
the draught produced a galvanic effect a violent trembling pervaded the old man s limbs his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed body returned gradually to its former immobility the eyes remaining open				874.8760190796536
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment				236.8258854452603
at length an old worm eaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of d artagnan				1.0510479197350602
he endeavored to cheer him up in his solitude				7278.674205740469
oh oh said m de trÃ©ville				16.603499165693506
if your friend remains another week in my cellar i shall be a ruined man and not more than justice either you ass				2640.570639870948
from every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles friends and foes companions and strangers indiscriminately and no one took offence or did anything but laugh				376.41515605800333
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness				2897.7979222614463
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo				1.053799269906612
taste this cutlet my dear d artagnan tis off one of my sheep you have very tender mutton and i wish you joy of it said d artagnan				1.032527565331239
you are somewhat blasÃ© i know and family scenes have not much effect on sinbad the sailor who has seen so many others				1488.1631475634342
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back				134.32937155955804
but continued aramis bazin is a well trained servant and seeing that i was not alone he discreetly retired				257.71679447097057
planchet met them hard by the shed				757.5472753426552
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker				2110.6139056011143
saved repeated morrel not being able to conceive such intense happiness by whom by my grandfather				823.175233067448
i am lost said he				8.267197925290295
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual				4653.622333214567
my husband dines with the chancellor replied the young lady he has just gone and i am sure he ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went two visitors who were there when the count arrived having gazed at him with all their eyes retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires				12422.032882871552
he would have pardoned me he would certainly have pardoned me if i had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric in ambiguous words it is true but rather drolly ambiguous				5983.552381834029
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone				1703.3699374104044
while singing milady listened				734.60980828519
i was thinking my dear old friend that when you were a musketeer you turned your thoughts incessantly to the church and now that you are an abbÃ© you are perpetually longing to be once more a musketeer tis true man as you know said aramis is a strange animal made up of contradictions				3729.8666803673264
when you return i will set the fuse myself but be careful to conceal your face so that you can not be recognized by them never fear there s ten o clock striking at greenwich groslow then having given the sailor on duty an order to be on the watch with more than usual vigilance went down into the longboat and soon reached greenwich				874.2750787012898
then you can quit your house leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and everyone s mouth will be filled with praises of your disinterestedness				16771.73605269207
my intention was to inform monsieur laporte through my husband in order that monsieur laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself there but i said d artagnan can go and inform monsieur laporte no doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre and would be allowed to pass whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against you ah bah said d artagnan you have at some wicket of the louvre a concierge who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would mme				26.116375029159233
bonacieux in her power				368.2097624521113
fortunately lord de winter is rich lord de winter is ruined for the moment oliver cromwell has annexed his income resources now is the time when baron porthos would be useful now it is that i regret d artagnan let us entice them away this secret aramis does not belong to us take my advice then and let no one into our confidence				1613.9006352998356
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself				116.24833498074939
this is what has happened my brother who was coming to my assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary met with the emissary of the cardinal who was coming in search of me				86.84009272525454
our mission is ended and there is nothing more to detain us now but the good pleasure of the great man to whom we were sent the young man bit his lips and whispered to his sergeant you will follow these men and not lose sight of them when you have discovered where they lodge come and await me at the town gate the sergeant made a sign of comprehension				1491.037006989572
noirtier s eye still retained its inanimate expression				290.27211357243897
adieu edmond adieu and thank you but the count did not answer				168.57220235415437
he fell down this morning and broke his leg				7349.899939601751
now as a quarter past one has already struck i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying that in another hour and thirty minutes mercÃ©dÃ¨s will have become madame dantÃ¨s fernand closed his eyes a burning sensation passed across his brow and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair but in spite of all his efforts he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company				1084.7235371942666
a florentine adventurer sire and that was all while the august spouse of your majesty is anne of austria queen of france that is to say one of the greatest princesses in the world she is not the less guilty monsieur duke				6041.62064808891
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d Ã©pinay villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered				2068.3268167713154
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba then said monte cristo you went to him monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nÃ®mes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out				85.51704277648385
having arrived before the pont du gard the horse stopped but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say				754.8411141417827
i have returned guitant				1448.736608584904
the two things agree marvelously well i am all attention said d artagnan				1.0424740297148147

anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur				1548.15778346332

which is to recover a lost and adored son a lost and adored son stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies at the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven				73.59740254335323
monte cristo slowly left the house and turned towards the quay				1640.1822099186288
at the end of three quarters of a league within fifty paces of festubert a larger bloodstain appeared the ground was trampled by horses				474.3189645263206
the child went directly to him without kissing his mother				333.169843658569
there was an impressive silence morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency				8077.607186782167
how have you spent this francs it is no business of mine when are you coming to the point cried the baroness shivering with anger and impatience				338.3108247058994
and should any misfortune occur to you dear edmond she continued with the same calmness which proved to fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his sinister thought if misfortune should occur to you i would ascend the highest point of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it fernand became deadly pale				164.18347842724614
the first prince of the blood the king s uncle no				76.29952623058206
the coadjutor alone obtained nothing				318.5675296225416
you will take your place in the coupÃ© to chÃ¢lons				21048.18930381077
having been several times up and down it he gave the wand back to his master and began without hesitation to perform the same evolutions over again				216.2271384335512
and i too said d artagnan				1.0436288116675108

you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and sisteron advancing he is advancing said louis xviii				14.218061893135449
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy why cried the queen how is that because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity				2017.5422730079454
whence have you these ideas of death you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the face of a whole theatre in the presence of your friends and those of your son challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory you do not suppose that i can for one moment wish to live				515.5572310284701
toward paris who stopped him two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mention the viscount de bragelonne and it was this young man who brought the monk to you				137.4884777421496
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look				156.06423672632195
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the ante chambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landing place have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt				8447.630234110327
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement				1301.0284660827178

she returned to louise took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a moment on the ground and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall				203.87202836110663
eugÃ©nie approached softly and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge				59159.37660530276
i have just left the count sir said he he is doubtless a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas				1751.0783209366182

but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she				35.56527171032069

and shall we take no notice of this incident m de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held				206.58271194842186
at this moment he saw the light of planier gleaming in front of him like a star				7313.757451330114
till tomorrow evening then till tomorrow evening then replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital				1081.6261007838445
eh eh said he reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period there is one who will be equipped in good time porthos yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator s wife as a bark yields to the rudder arrived at the cloister st magloire a little frequented passage enclosed with a turnstile at each end				1610.528070132328
the law we have seen how quietly mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly accomplished their transformation and flight the fact being that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think of theirs				3296.2418125097856

he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door				72.39090357939567
then believe me it will be time to act yes we will wait				906.959407472006

i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus				7486.541327826567
but his confidence in grimaud whose petty persecutions he now perceived were only a blind increased and he conceived the highest opinion of his intellect and resolved to trust entirely to his guidance				49058.78609730416
he answered in the same language				1279.323967049547

a circle was formed around them				17.82679627463247
then from time to time there came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention but which he always answered in the same tone of voice either kill or pardon it is very strange said albert to hear such words proceed from the mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage and one needs constantly to be saying to one s self this is no fiction it is all reality in order to believe it				6.319215982950345
besides is he not a butcher s son				215.95634784390668

he escapes us growled porthos pushing his huge shoulder against the hinges but in vain				116.33289880013072
then the officer began to pass in review all the people one after the other and stopping when he came to milady surveyed her very closely but without addressing a single word to her				19.030315102425185
never planchet				506.4255960643478

i learn all in the silence of my apartments for instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers and what was to take place this evening then i wrote then remarked the president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings he is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done				80.7330161387051
bonacieux hesitated to continue				237.68240379874496

afraid of making any inquiries at this house d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras				3161.7284353226896
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose				735.1774961100874
i can not be mistaken there are your horses				446.3403814928644
i did announce myself in truth as coming on the part of the marechal de grammont but being wounded in the right arm he was unable to write and therefore the count de guiche acted as his secretary there has been fighting then asked the queen motioning to raoul to rise				626.7456463084421
i draw upon him for francs my bills are returned unpaid and more than that i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of francs payable at his correspondent s in paris at the end of this month				2246.2279844457685

the king don carlos has not left bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace				3131.4862168045242
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love				242.92715189091763
bonacieux moved by a double sentiment love and curiosity				922.5765670746041
she is very amiable then is she not said albert				35.030850444950545
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a person suffering in his dreams and he suddenly threw his head back violently				792.0514488730227
be good enough to open to me for i wish to announce to monsieur le comte that my master one of his friends is here and wishes to greet him why didn t you say so said the servitor opening the gate				954.942778221846

but i m his cousin he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold and one which i have in my pocket and he drew out the handkerchief				1730.8228909090617
he had ordered his three musketeers and their companion to be with him at half past six in the morning				236.82972500737955
he is quite a child and tis a child he loves athos became thoughtful				159.281637854394
the cardinal could not keep up with them though with every wish to do so				16.107049915489107
we must now only think of you my dear friend and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible				173.60963988683017

you say then that the guardsmen sought a quarrel with the musketeers i say that it is probable that things have fallen out so but i will not swear to it sire				549.3909132236587
mazarin rose				31.909004440253206
penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his master s daughter mademoiselle julie and had never been able to change the name to madame herbault				4543.714852920281
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared				127.88975867973907
the baroness then thought of m de villefort				5.200403602701793
carlini flew joyfully to rita telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her father to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres				2716.3320412641688
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set				4228.020569464543
my dear friend cried aramis				20.828854958810275
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire				5370.234534873946
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us				278.05344383735843
oh no				8.547337827264068
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m de trÃ©ville the counsels being thrown into the bargain				2956.851849192591
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta				2713.116549796831
your note of this morning has completely bewildered me				10.338332441066417
all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the police interfering in the matter				1476.102763136041
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both				4213.967723552859
he had learned that dantÃ¨s had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dantÃ¨s was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done				94.5944844725065
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand				19.001453318528498
we don t know the locality and shall never find the wall				118.26543835637152
you have sent for me sir said athos to m de trÃ©ville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders				1109.1362114035812
i had no doubt he would return the following night				101.59531571295389
bring hither that horse friquet heard perfectly but he pretended not to do so and tried to continue his road				1814.03731958306
d artagnan being the bearer of the letter is naturally the head of the enterprise let him decide and we will execute well said d artagnan i decide that we should adopt athos s plan and that we set off in half an hour agreed shouted the three musketeers in chorus				399.7243195350884
speak out there s a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise				300.0721315840279
ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of				308.9884889894955
that will be sufficient you think so certainly very well then if they should hear of the separation ah yes what could i say that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari precisely				4668.170732153338
a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand				31.314337546681024
you will retract this assertion will you not beauchamp said albert with increased though stifled anger				623.1592196263555
at this instant a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies m de villefort by whose hand the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child everything is possible said monte cristo rising from the bench on which he had been sitting even he added in an inaudible voice even that the procureur be not dead				50.21567545843811
and you as for me i am quite sure that after turning out all my pockets and emptying my drawers i shall not find ten louis at home				177.48793344934165
he is cold said debray				212.276496197329
mademoiselle paulet had already gone mademoiselle de scudery was going				516.1480694275896
then he entreated peppino as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him francs for a mouthful of bread				8740.075062564738
you surely will not do that my dear count certainly i shall albert as i have promised to do it well said albert with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all events said monte cristo				1.0388280141980495
the door was scarcely closed upon him when the queen sank half fainting into the arms of her women				4130.551255492355
you will get yourself decapitated my beautiful queen and that would be a pity you laugh faintly				7747.916244190359
if you received the work electronically the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund				908.1031513942705
when the police is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the day when it comes to say with a sneaking air that the track is lost yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all countries they call that a murder a murder do you call it				7.113962332164754
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer				2070.0011689900944
d artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle				281.062209437815
i know him well there				269.96951361050304
this movement revealed the spot where winter s body had fallen				475.31381012772135
the countess was present at the races in the champ de mars said chÃ¢teau renaud				3.2579878667541986
god beholds your devotion and my martyrdom and believe me both will have their reward				14901.94779135065
the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said d avrigny and i will maintain this assertion before god and man villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair				205.77526172324545
had you known this edmond dantÃ¨s of whom they spoke no your excellency i had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the abbÃ© busoni himself when i saw him in the prison at nÃ®mes go on the jeweller took the ring and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the stone out of its setting and weighed it carefully				2379.873668474815
three is just my number now then who are you asked the englishman				27.57021388500757
albert de morcerf is no coward said monte cristo				1.0477735990634538
she took me away without speaking				654.131131631367
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme				47.52836517970564
and what do you know about the state you talk of said mme				16.94610596201601
planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down				124.84918337184209
oh mother he exclaimed such a misfortune has happened what				154.73186062974833
besides it doesn t concern me it relates to mademoiselle marie michon ah that is true said athos				3.8078378110695508
stop said selim seeing that she was about to go out you see i have not yet received the ring true said my mother				310.2519769372501
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond				2099.6233377102008
the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina				28960.25736219721
he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation				1709.7774584253314
gentlemen said mazarin i join with you in supplicating the queen to put an end to the miseries of her subjects				3032.276276761666
two men to the astonishment of d artagnan appeared shortly soon however his surprise vanished for he heard the murmurs of a soft harmonious voice one of these two men was a woman disguised as a cavalier				2484.8958135255084
a merry morning to you sunshine				4166.752660582949
athos and d artagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent				2425.7307350989477
that is more than time enough for us to devise a plan				1717.7105969443355
is the baroness at home inquired danglars				31.944597880013976
because he had boasted that he would perforate the stranger with whom you left him in dispute whereas the stranger on the contrary in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his back				244.1343799114738
yes replied she trying to recover her self possession				673.2844705494654
tell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied feeling with true delicacy that the person to whom she could be of the most service just then was madame de saint mÃ©ran				41.530130935629
madame danglars who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate piece of cabinet and inlaid work while lucien debray standing before a small work table was turning over the pages of an album				5339.909282325853
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old yes but i could give him the order i guitant and i preferred to give it to you guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier				28731.81779827299
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping				2028.6554590488163
and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with d artagnan are you thirsty as thirsty as a scotchman was grimaud s laconic reply				1328.643272549271
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time				244.4104331216514
and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything do you then really suffer asked morrel quickly				150.33182828367765
i could almost believe myself at the cafÃ© de paris murmured danglars				27.157011550264976
i regret i did not inform you sooner of this circumstance you have truly monsieur said d artagnan bowing again a courtesy for which i assure you i am very grateful you confuse me replied athos with his gentlemanly air let us talk of something else if you please				1111.4710145694648
madame de villefort stretched out her hand to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the spot where she would find valentine when the young lady herself entered the apartment				133.47831340627448
continue to seek for this man sir said the king to the minister of police for if as i am all but convinced general quesnel who would have been so useful to us at this moment has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished it required all villefort s coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him				11.51515866731475
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said andrea becoming more and more excited				1196.950131503993
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation				916.2660571958552
bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of d artagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost forever				804.4377492111413
he was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button hole the rosette of an officer of the legion of honor				824.312757782708
and now said d artagnan to the governor s but you are wounded it seems said planchet				160.6135147931372
bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these gentlemen and what have you done with your ecclesiastics asked d artagnan				1.0366989362349006
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest				427.036303704046
in the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice let the justice of god be done and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it				9.699043322554184
but what shall you do with him with whom with albert what shall i do with albert				319.3849130432128
what do you mean				19.27475604349128
repair your crimes toward her let her go free and i will exact nothing else from you you will exact said buckingham looking at felton with astonishment and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced them				59.106473784640336
then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling				968.904782790943
madame morrel looked again through the keyhole morrel was writing but madame morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper				1342.132335191376
here father here he said take this take it and send for something immediately and he emptied his pockets on the table the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller coin				5031.415190319032
you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars				11.617296882997438
he never spoke of women				7486.834062159086
the young man remained immovable				307.8007352153717
sir said valentine my grandfather wishes for a notary at this strange and unexpected demand m de villefort and his father exchanged looks				7284.1947785401135
i accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent putting the letter in her bosom she took her son s arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs				669.9065682302584
it was only a precaution				1064.3153966419272
you are irritated and vexed tell me how this fernand is related to you he is merely my father said albert m				98.77348787992115
we have said that teresa was handsome but this is not all teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies				7105.034410563124
sure of what that the owner of the horse was lord ruthven himself what lord ruthven do you mean why our lord ruthven the vampire of the salle argentina is it possible exclaimed the countess is he here in paris to be sure why not and you visit him meet him at your own house and elsewhere i assure you he is my most intimate friend and m de chÃ¢teau renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize was not the winning horse entered by the name of vampa what of that why do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom i was made prisoner oh yes and from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner to be sure i remember it all now he called himself vampa				815.1747596120313
oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me courage madame				219.02855685634592
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart				30.961086803598285
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body				981.0895784176962
oh my god thou knowest whether i am guilty				895.7589233887253
don t be uneasy on that score replied villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my house				200.2232020490127
i know he is a gascon reflected he but he may be one for the cardinal as well as for me				11.34935949522081
ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed				511.9084642256673
these exploits had gained luigi considerable reputation				2855.2370070177108

as to d artagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black				4579.976203813837
beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantÃ¨s father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream				308.94929978156193

he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet				917.4272245087692

her face therefore like that of the gentleman was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion				11339.323435816394
the english are almost of one mind in contending against the tyranny of charles and his adherents				7036.04068370549
put your names into a hat and draw lots a good idea said d artagnan				1.028865813608959
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted				2358.3387673965935
anne trembling with anger and scarlet with humiliation left the room shutting the door violently after her				13.305953097600597

and yet that villain benedetto will escape no one i tell you will escape benedetto will be punished then you too will be punished for you did not do your duty as a priest you should have prevented benedetto from killing me i said the count with a smile which petrified the dying man when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast				199.34885757851
but this did not arise from a want of affection on the contrary from a firm conviction				1270.3115685648402
ah yes about a year after the disappearance of his son the poor old man died of what did he die why the doctors called his complaint gastro enteritis i believe his acquaintances say he died of grief but i who saw him in his dying moments i say he died of caderousse paused				582.1586981343517
in ten minutes it would strike seven				2060.1050127528447
a horse he cried i have found a horse and i likewise said athos				4.072436878350203
listen to me edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him				14.73915284572834
the joy of the king was lively				949.0578006662635
my fault said he you must be mad				60.90030285765549
he stifled therefore the feelings of compassion that were rising composed his features and sat down grim and sombre at his desk				1436.9751888077678
just as the tutor and his escort disappeared in their turn a new traveler stopped on the threshold of the inn				423.0630043248736
my lord has forgotten the supper no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present go on then have it your own way come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face				108.60903845283211
at the corner of the quai they encountered bazin who was running breathlessly				7594.884861410069
aramis seemed to await a comfortable digestion d artagnan to be preparing his exordium				9437.953359932155
in the whole house said friquet the house belongs to him he occupies the second floor when he works and descends to the first to take his meals he must be at dinner now it is noon good said comminges				136.44325494138414
you ask me why i have requested this interview i will tell you in two words sir i will not marry count andrea cavalcanti danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards heaven				87.48534640325451
and the edicts				368.2959804081995
i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity				2531.3856064944684
reflect that i am your wife you are a poisoner in the name of heaven no in the name of the love you once bore me no no in the name of our child				842.4495843359967
what does all this mean asked aramis				18.32079418162551
on the following morning at five o clock d artagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mother s recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor d artagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow				1103.746865296024
still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish it if you demand it why then it shall be done				48.590178453575554
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only chÃ¢teau renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued				3675.8279963773857
here s to our colonel and let him know that we are always at his commands as far as london and farther and as d artagnan as he spoke looked at harrison the colonel imagined the toast was for himself				73.55796748286404
nothing is lost then and now madame till i see you again				67.66335667889517
anne frowned				107.94759417192253
the king and his escort were no longer there				153.79186855100153
good evening madame said the banker good evening m debray probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day				224.58198663286112
i only ask you a simple question answer it that is all i require i love a young girl count do you love her much more than my life another hope defeated said the count				5.387181991593168
someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains				3083.8368303265784
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor and although you are said to be rich i will venture to offer you something for your poor people will you accept my offering i thank you sir i am only jealous in one thing and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources however my resolution sir is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you will find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence the abbÃ© once more bowed as he opened the door the stranger bowed and took his leave and the carriage conveyed him straight to the house of m de villefort				3.3214867927537886
the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming and the two friends began to laugh				116.1438381181174
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood				49339.60158012818
from the count said bertuccio				249.1383169799663
it was a pledge a remembrance				1691.7122745773179
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian				943.2765561482483
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lost thirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london				382.8806755968786
let them come on				84.94400569346658
say no more about it				6.036262588677791
there is everything in a jesuit convent then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men undoubtedly said aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if i could have drawn without being recognized god pardon me said d artagnan to himself i believe he has become more gascon than i am then aloud well my dear aramis do you ask me why i came to seek you no i have not asked you that said aramis with his subtle manner but i have expected you to tell me well i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsieur de marsillac whenever you please prince though he is hold on				157.4513251013683
she had however just power to give one parting look to her grandfather who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul				972.2916763669532
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there anne of austria started				165.1001276384227
planchet said he				13.56913033220434
bertuccio s forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachman rue de la fontaine no				33.517719259058644
then i admit my patience failed me i drew my sword in my turn and as he came back to the charge i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me he let it pass through his body				730.4545636875898
if the poor abbÃ© had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem pooh pooh said the doctor with the impiety usual in persons of his profession he is a churchman				7818.848141799687
see what she writes to me athos said he				7.321845176770307
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse				981.2247877041265
good heaven				151.09331195089328
d artagnan and planchet mounted and took the road to st germain				28.326821947903753
he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his hands with fury				3052.6972490602443
they are quite new and have not yet been used				298.54131411773193
halloo major				259.8171224321845
they entered for the door was not locked there is much confidence among villagers				26374.09702774289
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood				2379.001157874616
good lord said d artagnan who as we have often said never stumbled at anything				418.2121366260247
do you talk of your honor				7373.3697925378
it was a good augury				1253.6658388337685
d artagnan held the bridle of athos s horse and porthos that of aramis				121.1092278865607
athos remained alone in the vast chamber where according to the cardinal s directions he was treated with all the courtesy due to a nobleman				6391.7416550014905
since you have no further interrogations to make leave me i beseech you she said				8.308384822535912
who then has so correctly informed you asked he for my paper which gave the first information on the subject has been obliged to stop for want of proof and yet we are more interested than you in exposing m de morcerf as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize				20888.9923075392
only this time it was no longer an inert body without feeling that the villain had to deal with				286.52900642189746
but what is going on in this accursed paris what is going on my lord				48.15513581642489
yes said the duke but take care my dear la ramee for i propose to beat you badly la ramee went out				30.666549689703665
a terrible fear transfixed him				11.699028409500386
gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men				481.8869675866005
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor				4273.4512716685285
let us be the avant guard said he to porthos and find good quarters at saint germain nobody will think of us and for my part i am greatly fatigued as for me replied porthos i am falling asleep which is strange considering we have not had any fighting truly the parisians are idiots or rather we are very clever said d artagnan				1.0285047291600367
be brave faithful and loyal he said you are brave faithful and loyal				9119.878368715774
the boat is waiting for us come besides said aramis what prevents our being distrustful and going aboard at the same time				65.57597664837473
monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl s arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child				1392.6651594952414
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind				179.49072908526284
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair				148.28597113444434
the four or five remaining hours before nine o clock arrived andrea employed in riding paying visits designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the banker s in their gayest equipages dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which danglars was just taking the initiative				12819.186497205757
the procureur then told his wife to come up				306.53612088995334
besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather large madame coquenard i gave you the preference				8432.0798159285
a moment said d artagnan				1.0491793169569967
let him have it let him have it she said				4.691943175937464
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir				1330.66963077082
at these words madame morrel rose and threw herself into her son s arms				109.36967083428814
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux the waiter had no suspicions andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all				389.5571741078735
his apartment consisted of two small chambers very nicely fitted up in a furnished house the hostess of which still young and still really handsome cast tender glances uselessly at him				17.557013183330167
m de trÃ©ville was not at his hÃ´tel				314.9169160677061
pardon my frankness too my lord i am obliged to you count for this pleasing intelligence				17030.08587824079
is he much changed he has become an abbÃ© that is all you alarm me his profession must have made him renounce any great undertakings on the contrary said athos smiling he has never been so much a musketeer as since he became an abbÃ© and you will find him a veritable soldier could you engage to bring him to me to morrow morning at ten o clock on the pont du louvre oh oh exclaimed athos smiling you have a duel in prospect yes count and a splendid duel too a duel in which i hope you will take your part where are we to go my lord to her majesty the queen of england who has desired me to present you to her this is an enigma said athos but it matters not since you know the solution of it i ask no further				521.4934430178037
well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army oh m de morcerf interrupted morrel				26.92667106399696
what demanded d artagnan				1.0612733349116588
will your eminence deign to open the door which leads to the count s room and in ten minutes all will be settled mazarin started				76.75636029730427
grimaud made the sign yes				846.5307817633519
you accuse him then				58.133951867391914
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering				223.94357420736137
what asked his lordship				1740.9020544329255
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen				458.08081999090865
you must dress yourself raoul said athos i am going to present you to some one to day monsieur asked the young man				1.6454096104229599
i was hidden behind that door he said which leads into the next house which i have rented valentine turned her eyes away and with an indignant expression of pride and modest fear exclaimed sir i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult valentine he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what people visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the place of the poison a healthful draught which instead of producing the death intended caused life to circulate in your veins poison death exclaimed valentine half believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying sir hush my child said monte cristo again placing his finger upon her lips i did say poison and death				233.59447014961322
in these days the throne is too dangerous a place for me to wish him to retain it				6.762580917229089
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away				417.9948263001468
my dear cousin i think i shall make up my mind to set out for bÃ©thune where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent of the carmelites this poor child is quite resigned as she knows she can not live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in danger				279.75893864714743
he had learned that the pretended message from anne of austria upon the faith of which he had come to paris was a snare but instead of regaining england he had abusing the position in which he had been placed declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her				17.486867931347273
i uttered a cry of joy the only moments of sadness i had known since the assassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this child				1850.8783061503354
a prisoner he reiterated				505.321535704396
porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied				1546.2956391133152
you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not yes really this is too absurd said villefort				36.24797543467525
what did your father tell you m morrel said he eagerly				28.75479979668572
i have fired since in that manner and have been quite successful what a cold wind resumed athos a wintry blast				29190.374001607976
but i will tell you				6.175724841413933
danglars left last night left m				126.80801570840566
but you tell me he is no more and therefore can have nothing to do with hatred or revenge so let all such feeling be buried with him you prefer then said the abbÃ© that i should bestow on men you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship that is true enough returned caderousse				199.43328601722644
how can it be effected someone must be sent to the duke but who who				3138.04527741622
porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play				10608.118120594061
nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that i could wish				715.7441516317257
ah exclaimed rochefort				39.97239255471057
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur d arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms				56292.70094084476
is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words oh my god no said lord de winter with apparent good nature				2002.511842481441
dantÃ¨s reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge				19014.94663155167
andrea as we can see was surrounded by misfortune				4344.086185751318
loose half drunk imposing the king s musketeers or rather m de trÃ©ville s spread themselves about in the cabarets in the public walks and the public sports shouting twisting their mustaches clanking their swords and taking great pleasure in annoying the guards of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them then drawing in the open streets as if it were the best of all possible sports sometimes killed but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged often killing others but then certain of not rotting in prison m de trÃ©ville being there to claim them				21.998564295316708
to wait replied athos				3.8919824958310154
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambition fernand and danglars how was this jealousy manifested				38879.41213788895
raoul trembled lest he should laugh among the rest at madame de chevreuse for whom he entertained deep and genuine sympathy but either instinctively or from affection for the duchess he said everything in her favor				306.5687180452749
there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles did you ever see mercÃ©dÃ¨s again inquired the priest				443.9321137343403
concerning a court intrigue in the meantime the forty pistoles of king louis xiii like all other things of this world after having had a beginning had an end and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed				1931.7851054260318
gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible that will give me time to pay him the officers were full of thanks and took away their prey				43787.482659217814
to hold for five minutes the gates they will be torn down twisted into iron wire ground to powder				3784.43992621004
i was saying it was very interesting what was all you were showing me				6.307221138614641
if you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of the business you must assist me by the most minute information on every point pray ask me whatever questions you please for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than i do myself in the first place then who examined you the king s attorney his deputy or a magistrate the deputy was he young or old about six or seven and twenty years of age i should say so answered the abbÃ©				19.347533530377806
but what makes you doubt it i was afraid i had made a mistake in the chamber and that i had found my way into the apartment of some churchman				4800.314017123499
scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows				286.98023267982194
the scotchman				103.24511741585845
you must have had enough for today				6945.273340127317
you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m d artagnan a difficult commission my lord replied d artagnan resuming his serious manner				165.8967021235912
but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you can not well mistake him he will enter by this door				56.682881302120826
you have acted kindly count in bringing me back to the place where i have enjoyed so much bliss				10433.50039058784
cries of death				183.1117891649171
each of you take a horse by the bridle he said to porthos and mousqueton turn to the left so that athos and aramis may see you clearly from the window they are coming then said porthos				14.761864305260456

this man was armand jean duplessis cardinal de richelieu not such as he is now represented broken down like an old man suffering like a martyr his body bent his voice failing buried in a large armchair as in an anticipated tomb no longer living but by the strength of his genius and no longer maintaining the struggle with europe but by the eternal application of his thoughts but such as he really was at this period that is to say an active and gallant cavalier already weak of body but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the most extraordinary men that ever lived preparing after having supported the duc de nevers in his duchy of mantua after having taken nÃ®mes castres and uzes to drive the english from the isle of rÃ© and lay siege to la rochelle				112.99941705707752

baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address				687.0190246884237

i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so				37.8572294491343
i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with the cardinal lower				11700.577676798668

madame replied aramis i must ask your pardon but i know not how to hide my indignation at seeing how a daughter of henry iv				81.65203756609164
as to his going or staying i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to do a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with anxiety				1322.6016134905342

but if you think the king s life is not worth what it must cost there s an end of the matter and i send to groslow to say i am ill no you are right said athos				277.821514744696

thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it m de trÃ©ville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that louis xiii one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and trÃ©ville next or even perhaps before himself				44.262012367109456

monte cristo quickly appreciated all that albert had collected here old cabinets japanese porcelain oriental stuffs venetian glass arms from all parts of the world everything was familiar to him and at the first glance he recognized their date their country and their origin				34111.353636819644
he then set himself to work to count his fortune				710.1914571733436
m coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon porthos he contented himself with saying monsieur our cousin will do us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the campaign will he not madame coquenard this time porthos received the blow right in his stomach and felt it				14.638621850760602
where were you born continued the president				34.58921430797212
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look				1095.2890443158858
man s whole life passes in doing these things and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them				57.98688728461935
he was already enjoying the sweet dream engendered by the possession of two hundred and nineteen louis made in a quarter of an hour when a voice was heard at the door of the hall which made him stir				3601.071713226126
our former life has it still no attractions for you				14.978815541994363
no god forbid said the cardinal only at what hour was he with you oh as to that i can speak positively your eminence for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock although i had believed it to be later at what hour did he leave your hÃ´tel at half past ten an hour after the event well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of trÃ©ville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs is one friend forbidden to visit another or a musketeer of my company to fraternize with a guard of dessessart s company yes when the house where he fraternizes is suspected that house is suspected trÃ©ville said the king perhaps you did not know it indeed sire i did not				50.81863852586229
answer continued milady				20.743970986015768
the trial				107.16071936899714
she took it and looked attentively on the count there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration				16536.313443427436
now gentlemen said d artagnan go up to your room again and in ten minutes i will answer for it you shall have all you desire the englishmen bowed and went upstairs				2425.4415826965437
but we know very well what had become of edmond				2760.372671479488
d artagnan monsieur well then athos porthos aramis and d artagnan forward cried athos				4.450346288119957
the demands in that programme must be granted we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations you suppose then that there are some said aramis smiling				15.582460638155368
he ran along the high road took the path he had before taken and reaching the ferry interrogated the boatman				6736.97806459585
presently they heard milady retire to her room				232.59003583548866
someone has told you the secret or perhaps you guessed that he was here that who was here your child your son your andrea i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness				2515.5648440578393
oh sir exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time				299.4392172158147
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor general is no other than count fernand of morcerf then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to you albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hands as if to prevent the light from reaching him				32.20371761097069
you here said chÃ¢teau renaud passing his arms through the young captain s are you a friend of villefort s				19.84519688892821
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family				676.9040181548355
we will embrace raoul and perhaps he will have news of athos stop an idea cried porthos indeed my dear d artagnan i don t know how you manage but you are always full of ideas let us go and embrace raoul woe to that man who should happen to contradict my master at this moment said mousqueton to himself i wouldn t give a farthing for his life they set out				65.46319243350257
yes count said milady in her softest voice and pressing his hand in her own i am happy in the love which your looks and your words have expressed to me every time we have met				1487.6381276981967
who ever heard of such an occurrence as this a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams				25340.22068617631
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no other than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar end for me the physician may be mistaken exclaimed dantÃ¨s				78.48948212376472
when he opened his eyes dantÃ¨s found himself on the deck of the tartan				22348.637699502335
when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight that grimaud kept bad watch cried porthos who had a great inclination to vent his ill humor on somebody				5065.1255343746
the gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chained up dog went up to the cabin				10689.911661811317
ah he has a niece interrupted porthos				14.188008780251389
the moment she lost sight of him milady tumbled fainting into her chamber				174.51191615520818
caderousse s knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry the corpse was conveyed to the morgue				21221.487493366534
the commission might well be called delicate and the king had reached in his jealousy of buckingham the point of not being jealous of anyone else				253.4960941891716
enter sir said he				7.460796301419368
what for five years he had been wanting a faithful servant a friend a helping hand seemed to have fallen from heaven just when he expected it the least				2794.766834242212
but you may use it replied lord wilmore i understand it and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the conversation				242.11106620062674
oh it must not be called suffering i feel a general uneasiness that is all				112.73941115458778
ah he said it is sad i know well to be forced to yield thus but pshaw				1800.8372338061906
well now she said let us see what you would do to prove this love of which you speak all that could be required of me				24.664099630513853

i saw her and you know who she is i believe i can guess at least listen said aramis				18.780621469742222
he pressed his burning lips to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale he felt the stiffened limbs he pressed his hand upon the heart but it no longer beat the child was dead				69.02474905362742
morrel shuddered as he thought of the conversation of the doctor and m de villefort and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands the stiff neck and the purple lips				212.15880843634687
he was with you just now				132.95241515543674
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets				6345.322059773402
one day the old man fell ill and died				1003.723958340851
not the least in the world oh you do quite right monsieur but why this question because while you were talking with him i watched you without listening to you and monsieur his countenance changed color two or three times bah preoccupied as monsieur was with the letter he had received he did not observe that but i whom the strange fashion in which that letter came into the house had placed on my guard i did not lose a movement of his features and you found it traitorous monsieur indeed still more as soon as monsieur had left and disappeared round the corner of the street monsieur bonacieux took his hat shut his door and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction it seems you are right planchet all this appears to be a little mysterious and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the matter shall be categorically explained to us monsieur jests but monsieur will see what would you have planchet				1134.6511267709398
i want all my household at auteuil but will no one remain in the house my lord asked baptistin				1381.9999975619603
two minutes later the thunder of a horse s hoofs was heard upon the road it was grimaud on his way to paris				124.30114079232946
my officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop here that prohibition is not for me said d artagnan				1.0283368819446075
this will be added noirtier with a smile one means by which you may a second time save me if the political balance should some day take another turn and cast you aloft while hurling me down				185.1309872806538
i know an italian prince rich as a gold mine one of the noblest families in tuscany who when his sons married according to his wish gave them millions and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a month				2105.7996632842464
ah and as if struck in the heart he let go the hook and dropped with a groan				302.51014404557554
upon his return to haydÃ©e he found her still very pale				156.74836104934425
dantÃ¨s did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head				32.1193629952717
four days would quite suffice to complete the seduction of felton				186.4200662881232

as the night before d artagnan did not return home till five o clock in the morning				165.4020809806338
as to the second vessel we will tell hereafter whom it carried and how it set sail				8261.476759257454
i had informed m morrel of my desire to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last half hour to tell me that if his ship the pharaon did not come into port on the he would be wholly unable to make this payment but said the englishman this looks very much like a suspension of payment it looks more like bankruptcy exclaimed m de boville despairingly				355.8647772099693
villefort dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no doubt dantÃ¨s patriotic services were exaggerated and he was made out one of the most active agents of napoleon s return				1362.727104133125
it was then that d artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it				6.41980813814487
besides it was necessary he should stay at chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess				2295.0209643195085
etiquette had no minutiÃ¦ unknown to him				10.908242954513037
here you are home again raoul said the comte				1569.2014581315873
are they all full grimaud translated the question and groslow who was wiping the perspiration from off his forehead answered some full others empty d artagnan struck the barrels with his hand and having ascertained that he spoke the truth pushed his lantern greatly to the captain s alarm into the interstices between the barrels and finding that there was nothing concealed in them come along he said and he went toward the door of the second compartment				7018.857027120303
after having touched felt examined these treasures edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy he leaped on a rock from whence he could behold the sea				149.67071287591878
a carriage waited at the door the coachman was on the box and a police officer sat beside him				4.1240833294777435
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it yes said danglars				20.78761855645961
far from here asked athos				3.982538316615791
as you say mazarin is a knave				20590.964679231456
that contemptible mazarin has stopped poor scarron s pension that is unreasonable said athos saluting in his turn the two cavaliers				53151.1815830201
those must have been ten weary years dantÃ¨s took some louis from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him				129.36507854585773
benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week				2859.7988928822188
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed				1136.9127767912526
but said d artagnan shall we not pursue that woman later said athos				4.190404185188861
he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure				1549.921654870676
very well take blaisois with whom i know not what to do since i already have grimaud willingly said aramis				15.99203701619967

the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed				2610.130637928747
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world				80.35689874953694
what ails our friend said aramis he resembles one of dante s damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels				157509.5369111472
rue de la victoire walked behind this man whose presence comforted louise				1370.1321155532669
a prisoner has escaped from the chÃ¢teau d if and they are firing the alarm gun replied dantÃ¨s				106.402561663743
you were my tutor why did you not teach me to swim oh monsieur le comte replied the old man had any misfortune happened to you i should never have dared to show myself to the marshal again but how did the accident happen asked raoul				61.71144605925406

at the extremity of the building on the contrary he saw one of the three windows open				480.42158501664113
monte cristo arose and approached her took her hand and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear child and take courage in remembering that there is a god who will punish traitors it is a frightful story count said albert terrified at the paleness of haydÃ©e s countenance and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request oh it is nothing said monte cristo				1.034101367631288
i assure you cried danglars with a confidence and security proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt for the young man i solemnly declare to you that i should never have thought of writing to yanina did i know anything of ali pasha s misfortunes who then urged you to write				597.7187280386596

well said the young man let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and bandits				3115.3415924079004
he had now leisure to look to his wound				902.0572275765104
from whom is this said he eagerly				27.660922460409893
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called out				82.3936656005427
had d artagnan continued his intimacy with these three men he would have become a superior character				615.1536899704245
a few locks of gray mingled with his hair which was still thick and matted while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics				32851.15313907501
are you french sir said he to athos				47.27390546485229
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by d artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over				364.77563116863104
we shall save you another time as we have done this only with a better chance of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance my good edmond answered the abbÃ© be not deceived				362.63449417171813

go the musketeers set off and d artagnan was left alone with raoul				368.7198128002385
meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and one might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by king louis xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose head was cleft with a hatchet				13377.958643235897
that workmanship is divine he exclaimed				63.9539662694423
the count watched him				5.7077538819533835
i will call thee mouston and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any longer oh cried mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor i shall be grateful all my life it is too much to ask alas thought d artagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me will monsieur remain long with us asked mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance				1822.6627851678395
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him				4.714143613308114
there were but three hÃ´tels in this part of the street and only two windows looking toward the road one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis occupied the other belonging to aramis himself				105.60876837427712

the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at length weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous dream				384.62436010383783

six hours after he left pierrefonds he was at saint germain				36.61078065862578
besides our supper can t delay you much				184.46621946197578
that was what he could not know				137.8638591372232
m de villefort pressed his hand upon his brow which at first pale had become red and burning then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his senses he wanted air				3704.8804606888452

his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole				445.4597026608571
here i am dear count welcome home again i arrived an hour since from dieppe no from trÃ©port indeed and i have come at once to see you that is extremely kind of you said monte cristo with a tone of perfect indifference				3904.4220002234415
felton recognized it also and made a step toward the door				15.172847106738763
villefort approached noirtier				65.8735809388844
it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary				58758.36319372395
the duke has had many affairs of gallantry and if he has fostered his amours by promises of eternal constancy he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by his eternal infidelities no doubt said milady coolly such a woman may be found well such a woman who would place the knife of jacques clÃ©ment or of ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic would save france yes but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination were the accomplices of ravaillac or of jacques clÃ©ment ever known no for perhaps they were too high placed for anyone to dare look for them where they were				338.79205910301863
if it is a snare replied d artagnan i shall scent it out be assured				5324.673825261264

i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor because i was shown up the private stairs how so i know not it must have been a mistake mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing				1871.374743109974
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth				154863.4845533195

compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements				2211.45406297605
now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race				2955.557810424571
i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon				1308.9754955745693

i swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that i shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained with hurried steps the porch where olivain was waiting with the horses				367.9378954938945
answer me on what i could get you lie repeated the abbÃ© a third time with a still more imperative tone				722.0484812298405
let it be a million said caderousse you can never have so much as i wish you thank you said the young man				1.809303670887348
i know he can not save my life but he may strengthen me to give my evidence against whom against my murderer did you recognize him yes it was benedetto the young corsican himself your comrade yes				563.6857835849655
athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded him				3.0870136885408725
franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle				5780.56230100024
i always knew you were a good son and inquired dantÃ¨s with some hesitation do you know how my father is well i believe my dear edmond though i have not seen him lately yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room that proves at least that he has wanted for nothing during your absence dantÃ¨s smiled				17.42125149309952
what can you expect athos				64.4367257597823
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on				605.8476844615266
you can see it in his eye				338.6307104420779
what do you wish gentlemen who are you said the same voice in the same commanding tone				296.5177852511806
and what do you reckon your outfit will cost said d artagnan				1.0372936739426546
d artagnan is for mazarin he said to himself				77.85639404819162
from time to time his nostrils dilated as if eager for the smell of powder and he panted like a horse				674.7690211593041
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which d artagnan is blindly governed				125392.06053279819
now gentlemen said athos when he had ascertained there were five chambers free in the hÃ´tel let everyone retire to his own apartment				256.83387860229766
if it were not so far from here to the house i would return and finish him and you would do well if you are afraid of his recovering for you know if a wound in the head does not kill at once it is cured in a week and d artagnan threw a second glance toward parry on whose face such an expression of joy was manifested that charles stretched out his hand to him smiling				300.66179336694233
oh i will be a match for you murmured milady between her teeth be assured of that you poor spoiled monk you poor converted soldier who has cut his uniform out of a monk s frock by the way resumed de winter stopping at the threshold of the door you must not milady let this check take away your appetite				2546.7204739961144
five minutes afterward bazin set off on a full trot urging on his horse by the blows of a parapluie which he was in the habit of using instead of a riding whip				2180.5494238548695
we let them tell their story out replied mousqueton				108.44395768515875
the dinner chapter				1.2208988625267994
sir said mousqueton i much fear that what you ask for are very rare things in this detestable and barren country and i think we should do better to go and seek hospitality from the owner of a little house we see on the fringe of the forest how				2969.2584603018654
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that d artagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place				422.4882566971615
the marriage feast the morning s sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby tinted light				657.5702593491646
m de trÃ©ville approved of the resolution he had adopted and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear he himself would undertake to find him let him be where he might				2691.3021292568783
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon for you see the bright side of everything what would you have said d artagnan				1.0362488015040638
and what does it concern then my captivity i heard of it the day it happened but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him				27.186280168878092
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else woman woman why do you have such ideas cried caderousse or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man what do you mean added caderousse				265.02128473542655
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table				123.17219972129982
i wished to see all and to judge of everything for myself hoping the explanation would be in your father s favor and that i might do him justice				1293.5249933440082
therefore let us separate				395.1065757233654
my faith it was time that idea came into porthos s head				35.27362034322385
your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly				91.71940568217043
the marquis of saint mÃ©ran				101.5293558319057
shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantÃ¨s				421.9863200535803
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last those are kind and cheering words				808.7716266593081
everything was in order laces dresses jewels linen money all were arranged in the drawers and the countess was carefully collecting the keys				21741.756973883734
need we think of that since we are to save the king				50.8407552335072
with a slight inclination of the head danglars signed to the count to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with gold				178.4853305983575
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglars excuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery				40476.29893954504
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one s self not in paris but in venice				3252.450285215686
bonacieux had made with him for that very evening but we are bound to say to the credit of our hero that the bad opinion entertained by m de trÃ©ville of women in general did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess				1683.3829927254922
come sir said comminges make haste you must obey the king sir said broussel i am in bad health and can not give myself up a prisoner in this state i must have time it is impossible said comminges the order is strict and must be put into execution this instant impossible said louvieres sir beware of driving us to despair impossible cried a shrill voice from the end of the room				172.43052010303026
mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean he came his horse going at a foot s pace to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year seven men surrounded by empty bottles				1578.5622342694878
this is not the hÃ´tel des princes come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only wish to live like a retired baker caderousse sighed				212.36184292352212
i i was where d artagnan stands				691.9928178831445

the lackeys were brought by the cries she made				716.6706798222818
but speak i will listen you recollect that sad night when you were half expiring on that bed in the red damask room while i scarcely less agitated than you awaited your delivery				27097.35680622067
the guide took them thinking them merely a few pieces of little value but the light of the torch revealed their true worth				35522.02247240282
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england she was young you say twenty five years old beautiful ravishingly blond yes abundance of hair falling over her shoulders yes eyes of an admirable expression when she chose				5268.037520180631
think of your joy mother when you see me return with an embroidered uniform				1678.5376605136385
to your eminence murmured bonacieux rolling his eyes round in astonishment				352.6794525433966
one day when they were talking over their plans for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a man came out of the wood near which the two young persons used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them				11.523312728002356
there again monte cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts				1586.719357115385
well sir said madame de saint mÃ©ran after a few minutes reflection i must hasten the marriage for i have but a short time to live you madame you dear mamma exclaimed m de villefort and valentine at the same time				52.230832391267235
he gave orders that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared but at two o clock she had not returned				1232.199629135049
ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the mantle piece and the shelves i have not got any candles take one of the carriage lamps bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey				428.70297481972904
well replied milady after a moment of silence from the present time cease to talk of impossibilities do not overwhelm me with happiness cried d artagnan throwing himself on his knees and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him				32.34997613251651
this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear count				725.550900190874
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday				3460.234777716366
but continued d artagnan how did you escape i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window				48.22188710741988
one by one he undid the buttons of his doublet took it off and deposited it by the side of his hat				654.2384388583204
bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event he attributed it i believe to a political cause i doubted from the first and now i think entirely as he does				123.96658984794597
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long				252.95864406782044
you do not know at all and in this way they will chase him to paris without drawing a trigger grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and will oppose to him an impassable barrier grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm all lyons will hasten to welcome him				10.649199388149865
under his assumed name in order that he might be appointed to the post he subsequently held				418.409608128311
only remember on the of october morrel i shall expect you at the island of monte cristo				1.1176925921085523
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour s grace				7605.118932242078
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead the devil cried d artagnan				1.033733843838528
i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan				329.75182318940506
the brigadier calm and dignified as the law he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand questions addressed to him and re entered the hotel				1021.8645539175709
he did not wear the uniform cloak which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence but a cerulean blue doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water ripples in the sun				472.4627861565162
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman				329.222513901331
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity				24726.931423374335
oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that i have found that which i sought like a patient miner i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence				48806.37164930797
tis a comfort said the gascon since we shall not die of thirst				8403.16417737045
a handkerchief tied at the four corners is to be the signal next moment d artagnan entered				110.36684129712175
louis xiii				5.6672690659802365
what could he say				203.1372530727757
who are you then cried all the witnesses of this scene				1788.292499892607
her very self she gave it me last night				447.4002626746142
that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlini s rear when he fell				657.2956434619722
if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished				645.854585738099
when i came to myself again i was stretched in the same place				230.4359333778431
if m danglars will not fight with me i will kill his son in law cavalcanti will certainly fight the servant announced the young man but the banker recollecting what had transpired the day before did not wish him admitted				13174.157951945605
there is something so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe				875.9955938710658
i owe to this worthy lord all the happiness i ever knew				1354.230937541987
my faith				11.295502313421737
he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to edward s room and his eye reaching as far as madame de villefort s apartment he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor				147.83398708648105
the path was wide but dark				953.9497164295738
near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress				1134.250824974296
it was then that he encountered for the first time villefort s look that look peculiar to the magistrate who while seeming to read the thoughts of others betrays nothing of his own				128.4982222462547
i am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may suppose				1280.2631465632555
or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another what is that break his arm wound him but do not kill him i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i and you that will be another thing i shall be brought home no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings				2192.4413156735977
back shouted d artagnan or you are dead two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them a third pistol shot was heard aimed by d artagnan and one of his adversaries fell				809.0786642073898
yes sir and i think i have the honor of addressing count andrea cavalcanti count andrea cavalcanti repeated the young man accompanying his words with a bow				1228.280396492779
hem said the king				13.14510971527471
light the candles in my apartment if you please the innkeeper gave orders to a servant to go before franz with a light				1272.8982502517028
planchet said d artagnan to his domestic who just then insinuated his head through the half open door in order to catch some fragments of the conversation go down to my landlord monsieur bonacieux and ask him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine i prefer that ah ah				80.43353126002083
i am going to fight because i am going to fight answered porthos reddening				1373.7904115852984
you had only read a line or two said d artagnan read the letter again from the commencement willingly said aramis				18.106573397750697
and now what are we to do and where do you wish me to conduct you asked d artagnan				1.0346639142170164
aramis you certainly are full of wisdom the young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other sequel				14295.899724823457
as for her husband he was a strapping fellow of forty or five and forty who had more than once in time of danger given ample proof of his presence of mind and courage and you say interrupted monte cristo that this took place towards the year your excellency in what month june the beginning or the end the evening of the ah said monte cristo the evening of the of june				46497.25296430533
of the evil you have done said the voice				206.10285483693167
then cried villefort was it you who bought m de saint mÃ©ran s house did it belong to m de saint mÃ©ran demanded monte cristo				1.0736454686765557
the young man felt her press his hand and comprehended that this was a sentiment not of coquetry but of gratitude because of his departure				749.9317801432251
you are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me are you not said the count				7.43771489189808
at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village curÃ©				4469.326733014324
devil of a man corsican that you are always mysteries or superstitions				14207.541666400688
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money the host became as pale as death for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master				394.4507298381109
oh mon dieu				96.11368702491947
then he said aloud you met him i dare say in the park hunting perhaps no nearer nearer still				3234.6669563961045
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it				20.240671200838662
ah monsieur said the young man i meet you then at last				152.87559134004206
you are poor are you not then he added to himself these english revolutionists are all beggars and ill bred my lord i ought to have a fortune of six millions but it has been taken from me you are not then a man of the people said mazarin astonished				45.59061618919303
he was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside				5739.385903681632
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted				677.5802423402616
come let us see what you will do for me everything that your eminence may please to command me was the reply				395.1719564516195
presently there are not a sufficient number of people here yet we shall be remarked at this moment the door opened and in walked the coadjutor				287.4313471805966
i perceive that this creature will be my particular aversion he muttered				170.80335828781574
at the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to obey				600.9973737514761
well said he filling the glasses let us drink to captain edmond dantÃ¨s husband of the beautiful catalane caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp				66804.30606640266

m the epistle is laconic said d artagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter				120.11347123901295
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness				5812.879981373671
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris				111.34602220079665
come morrel it is not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage				916.3551911104116
when he had run over all these names in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his head				17.474123182029047
the bolt gave way and the door opened				1402.7288714978968
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count				502.9443301722241
they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation				6282.944535524588
yes i understand said valentine it is because you love me the old man assented				39696.7099358171
it is very simple mousqueton had said he is thinking of groslow it was captain groslow the reader will remember who had broken parry s head				746.5127616146098
d artagnan turned toward the musketeers and made a sign imperceptible to the crowd but very easily understood by that chosen regiment the flower of the army				627.3517194882992
have you anything nothing the devil said aramis				15.806372315948705
do you think you have to do with galley slaves or novices in the world				103.29081399417538
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand				195.42245488077475

tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt urban grandier though my friend urban grandier wasn t a sorcerer he was a learned man				93.61206717121536
i wore a long sword which cut like a damascus you remember it aramis for you always called it balizarde				16330.354080137573
athos and aramis were more and more astonished				5971.729087345371
and must i lose the one to save the other				36.11686909333648
d artagnan reflecting on his future amours addressing himself to the beautiful night and smiling at the stars ascended the rue cherish midi or chase midi as it was then called				1259.8370655493927
the duchess de longueville has invited me to pass a few days in normandy and has deputed me while her son is being baptized to go and prepare her residence at rouen after which if nothing new occurs i shall go and bury myself in my convent at noisy le sec and i said athos am returning to bragelonne				2891.141265662981
you will find your horses in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by man				728.1155976765182
my affianced husband returned				169.21874165769543
look well at me said monte cristo putting the light near his face				116.81004500495362
these two women gave him more uneasiness than the war with spain the quarrel with england or the embarrassment of the finances				9977.595993618643
don t ask me for counsel don t tell me you are perplexed what to do				143.081470556453
under orders from general cromwell				121.63774509812718

while doing so he observed m noirtier at one of the open windows where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony				1528.4942852953636

besides the king i am certain awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king				218.13345195096662
d artagnan entered behind him				4.186989755965467
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantÃ¨s was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain				998.5244209861972
return to camp and you shall know rochefort remained for a moment in thought then as they were only a day s journey from surgÃ¨res whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king he resolved to follow the advice of athos and go with them				28.82378884916478
for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that son of whom m de morcerf was so proud				13827.205044291533
ask them to sing one more song it is so delightful to hear music in the distance when the musicians are unrestrained by observation danglars was quite annoyed by the young man s indifference				7249.16346767021
is it for this i name you captain of my musketeers that they should assassinate a man disturb a whole quarter and endeavor to set fire to paris without your saying a word				224.7896211090048
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same				1270.7017197185942
confound you and your punctuality said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host				492.81333063081036
like a philosopher danglars returned at this moment alone				480.6619530515792

who knows said gondy such men are like thunderbolts one recognizes them only when they have struck every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart				1117.6418030508466
the same night such a man of regularity was the patron of la jeune amÃ©lie the profits were divided and each man had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty francs				1425.0768348426834
could the prisoners see each other he asked				29.824606281380213
all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber				111.32261024340252
behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was charles stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold				2450.643099452821
if you loved me you would view all this otherwise				8281.48936902245
his desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked it				139.97982142904723
at that moment the countenance of mme				16.529059130409436
it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him				7.229575272373079

they are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition a function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish i prefer my own specific undoubtedly and so should i prefer it after the effects i have seen produced but of course it is a secret and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you but i said monte cristo rising as he spoke i am gallant enough to offer it you how kind you are only remember one thing a small dose is a remedy a large one is poison				13515.789124891597
but he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung the deuce they do said mousqueton i think i should like the siege of rochelle better than this war then porthos meantime asked d artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey				402.6600475013941
alas said milady i know it is so				45.00138717948508
anne of austria returned to her oratory furious				4872.542504968657
old dantÃ¨s was dying with anxiety to know what had become of edmond				4255.577019129584
at first the captain had received dantÃ¨s on board with a certain degree of distrust				30203.35108844036
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d artagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m de trÃ©ville s private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl				27035.716199118266
at ten o clock milady began to appear restless				63621.15820857865
not at all my dear sir said la carconte in her most gracious manner				242.13865973804656
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variÃ©tÃ©s i purchased mine at constantinople it cost me more but i have nothing to fear but you forget replied debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free who will tell her the first person who sees her she only speaks romaic that is different but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes oh no replied monte cristo i do not carry brutalism so far				717.750008081906
at the same moment whilst d artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase				427.3722163076407
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite				140777.06024472247
do you not know that we italians have eyes only for the man we love true replied franz				29.381041989935706
the sergeant had not the courage to reply he showed him the open door the empty room				37.305992718543216
well i will tell you				7.500261432902105
i will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens you shall have no weapon left in your power there is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it				6.3355529895733795
the two men approaching the ends of the bed took the sack by its extremities				8274.218648491054
grimaud drew the comb from his pocket and passing his fingers over the largest teeth pronounced this one word pointed true said la ramee				13.459381478811547
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish				5867.338767065096
the murderer supposing him dead let fall his head and disappeared				282.8421244567266
gad replied d artagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same again whilst all this was going on athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st antoine				1340.932272232688
as i noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to my blood stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of la carconte				27.751247976568283
who could know that i was here already said the young man				1.796790668222858
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge				1481.630651730464
aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon				1019.7063122049504
you know raoul grimaud is an old and zealous servant he will follow you yes sir answered raoul				51.579413275563155
there had been no stipulation in her favor				321.7651175450671
the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition				2802.6405319232067
now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome for my part dear mother interposed renÃ©e i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into m de villefort s hands then i shall be contented just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis				13328.03980473819
but has one ever seen such a wild fellow continued he making himself a mazarinist and helping to arrest broussel				2637.1065506635296
i eat everywhere and of everything only i eat but little and today that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my day of appetite for i have not eaten since yesterday morning what cried all the guests you have not eaten for four and twenty hours no replied the count i was forced to go out of my road to obtain some information near nÃ®mes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop and you ate in your carriage asked morcerf				149.82530558602832
he perceived his mistake but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness				47638.73192893677
then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads but observe cried d artagnan that there is a woman in the affair a woman carried off a woman who is doubtless threatened tortured perhaps and all because she is faithful to her mistress beware d artagnan beware said aramis				16.97791246993557
recollect what our excellent father so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us monte cristo started				384.0829684752927
the outlook was sad				191.50013901472582
when they reached the street aramis said well athos what do you think of whom pardieu				2170.703292281675
this was before his servant came				594.8285656881084
every means had been employed in vain to restore the use of his limbs				1920.9415142959779
at this sight the young man stopped short not in admiration of raphael s picture but as if fascinated at the sight of some terrible object				5555.402567379737
as he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this commission and then instead of putting the letter in the post which is never safe i took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to paris and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess himself				102.95044746001027
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me				38.97708388619755
does your excellency wish me to accompany him no the coachman ali and baptistin will go the count descended to the door of his mansion and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of danglars				260.6850587766352
oh said caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair i should say you were the englishman lord wilmore i am neither the abbÃ© busoni nor lord wilmore said monte cristo think again do you not recollect me there was a magic effect in the count s words which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man				30.01012413088479
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop				453.895715351821
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others				1387.4433945889082
monte cristo shuddered and arose				619.9772176439416
i have seen that mother i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them				13.36209236638076
is she your daughter no mademoiselle said monte cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question				260.56376598436634

the sick man was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the door				10.354746573051317
well what do you think of this my fine fellow asked debray of the sergeant at arms slipping a louis into his hand				13.144141333086596

the king threw himself into an arm chair				190.1830051352818
this time i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my pocket felt that the point was sharp and sprang over the wall				136.02814652094074
from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues before our letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty said aramis coloring i will take that upon myself				438.17473084905146
from the comte de la fere said aramis				13.927281589351985
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantÃ¨s carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value why everything is relative answered the abbÃ©				20.75427553782371
arras was encumbered with fugitives				1153.4495195947256
now monsieur de vallon said mazarin what service do you prefer in the town or in the country porthos opened his mouth to reply				4682.268931908633
the champs Ã©lysÃ©es				15.738721596130842
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks				72230.81759532657
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses				469.3613352974435
all i can say is if ever i should get such a chance the living should be my theme and you will probably find your theme ill chosen but said albert breaking in upon his discourse never mind the past let us only remember the present				2024.0165797590137
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud very well let us say no more about it				5.967272350857822
then in the long days on board ship when the vessel gliding on with security over the azure sea required no care but the hand of the helmsman thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails edmond with a chart in his hand became the instructor of jacopo as the poor abbÃ© faria had been his tutor				6410.812828967186
on the fourth he was no longer a man but a living corpse				4338.7824436616
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenant s heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events				1431.4623679259373
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani s a well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation				867.8309459692542
this however was nothing to a sculptor like vampa he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it				6.995278984920429
just then madame de villefort in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the room while she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears				988.5396867709578
is he still amusing himself in italy i believe so however he regrets your absence extremely				61941.69995351066
repeat it				8.255584757687638
i think it will be wise to set off said d artagnan				1.0376930251986753
mordaunt cried the three friends tis mordaunt but athos exclaimed d artagnan				1.0290093417912634
but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune				857.9412938397138
valentine arose placed a chair for morrel requested barrois not to admit anyone and having tenderly embraced her grandfather and sorrowfully taken leave of morrel she went away				69.68580372402127
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal				58739.59401755981
two hours passed thus madame de saint mÃ©ran was in a feverish sleep and the notary had arrived				197.6210294352284
now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may				18388.73069545966
we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis				174.86943536156645
no and yet they refused to buy it why said chÃ¢teau renaud				3.8792860936081763
d artagnan went straight to the sergeant				6823.337626424632
listen he said at the end of yonder corridor is a door of which i have the key it leads into the park				1133.6409069016238
but do you happen to belong to him monsieur d artagnan replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority				7654.82458328561
there was a secret communication between the cardinal s apartments and those of the queen and through this corridor mazarin passed whenever he wished to visit anne of austria				65.10538539880137
what are you thinking about said the king go on my good parry unless you are tired parry resumed his reading				12303.848626918105
once in london we shall be hard to find without considering continued athos throwing a glance at aramis the chances that may come to us on the way yes said aramis i understand i however do not understand said porthos				10.800306758344545
cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethe s heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristo s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger				1680.7642177336159
you have not played for a long time d artagnan and i have no inclination to play swear to nothing				183.21572291117718
all at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified bound				32277.32119597283
the king signed the order for release and trÃ©ville carried it away without delay				4584.013834966901
never mind where it comes from said porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink it no said athos don t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source you are right athos said d artagnan				1.0298622838643852
and m bonacieux whom d artagnan had pushed into the hands of the officers denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to save him				3.8148402053012256
what granted me scarcely more				418.98300271355436
he was going toward the door when mazarin stopped him				7.307791249244616
her crimes i know them not her disorders i know them not her vices i know them not				56.786765837738024

we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared				1964.8437994803512
the marquis de saint mÃ©ran one of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of louis xviii				21.823373764836493
d artagnan eagerly searched for the heading of this letter it was dated from the chateau du vallon				250.92835627231696
still confidence was not restored to all minds and the general opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the end of the month				3860.439587729332
perhaps the cold began to affect him and he took a perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression				1545.3897245198189
but d artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished				22295.120189293033
but all this will come to an end trÃ©ville will come to an end				693.2375850682258
then he thought he was going to die				120.07510340882105
he took her for the queen said d artagnan				1.0408822308869339
without doubt he recognized d artagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head				29.9020786933382
the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean				832.3826727507553
you spent it as you pleased that was your business				710.5735522460869
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its master s favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish				3100.1433886254054
i arose				67.30388928225209

yes indeed that s the right thing				3938.525099977709

but have the kindness to give the abbÃ© busoni i told you he was not at home repeated the valet				173.51041080628568
in the eyes of many benedetto appeared if not a victim to at least an instance of the fallibility of the law				2760.2884328762175
the noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won planchet that was the name of the picard				33157.65891066714
that s right said athos put your other hand here and he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers				3005.561602723479
franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction				3724.1228693663925
is he some minister out of office oh no not at all vicomte athos replied he is simply a gentleman of great genius who has fallen into disgrace with the cardinal through having written certain verses against him do gentlemen then make verses asked raoul naively i thought it was derogatory so it is my dear vicomte said athos laughing to make bad ones but to make good ones increases fame witness monsieur de rotrou				94251.40821272919
the anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer in spite of his efforts to suppress it terrified his sensitive inamorata				25944.066116395956
when my father conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for m noirtier possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result well said monte cristo it is just as i thought it was politics which brought noirtier and m d Ã©pinay into personal contact				59219.1542721307
the judge chapter				1.3278479656135673
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger				1162.8204595245963
besides do you see that door athos yes what then well you can go out by that door whenever you please for from this moment you are free as the air i recognize you there my brave d artagnan replied athos but you are no longer our masters				1893.1621751503524
it is true that this provincial was a gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of d artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated				24934.25122100335
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly				1007.8234904172634
yes go go said she to her brother the effects are drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them silence was re established				20269.10229408732

the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious				5398.0080558287555
when are you to be married i will tell you all said valentine from you i have nothing to conceal				9005.938370721995
nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner				2636.109565149362
i wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so of which i stood absolutely in need on account of my accident well well she must be at her country seat for she has not answered me truly no so i yesterday addressed another epistle to her still more pressing than the first				1542.225039455947
with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while kitty pushed the bolts				32189.40447790676
well said he let us see gentlemen what are his eminence s commands and d artagnan unsealed the letter and read m				91.98131554101037
monsieur is as usual led by his favorite yesterday it was choisy to day it is la riviere to morrow it will be some one else				1984.5306982015077
go go i implore you and return hereafter				14558.438293093981
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and that s a comfort can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition i don t know him but as you spoke to him you must have seen him oh it s a description you want exactly so a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman that s the man cried d artagnan again he forever he				955.8589306853208
i have an extraordinary means which i will not employ but in the last extremity to close your mouth or at least to prevent anyone from believing a word you may utter i mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter				411.5819242413415
ah this is not right athos insults us he wishes to die alone it is bad bad bad mousqueton witnessing this despair melted into tears in a corner of the room				67.49363328927518
just so why he is a second ariosto no his name is the count of monte cristo there is no count of monte cristo said debray				113.193883848732
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands				53.59809359643961
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found time to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume and going to chapelle en serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place				460.1812377998596
the door had been opened and shut again the mercer s pretty wife had disappeared				125.85929126769241
see said the count how very ungrateful women are				120.55552595638473
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof				23851.83772079535
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal on perceiving him i have not forgotten with what zeal you have served me				16.12563192958898
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m de nargonne had married m danglars				99.78251938118848
the king went straight to him				5.725049022957915
milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance and which so rarely failed of their effect anger made her eyes flash in the darkness				616.3213627993655
athos whose keen eye lost nothing perceived a faintly sly smile pass over the lips of the young gascon as he replied we had a short discussion upon dress and you aramis asked athos				4.572106288205735
do you see whispered aramis to athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt				40874.91495957736
i like your manner raoul and your politeness has touched me athos was more delighted than can be told				7542.352488387287
but he must be disturbed cried the host here are two english gentlemen just arrived well well the english like good wine as you may know monsieur these have asked for the best				1745.5186891576038
it is quite regular and explicit said the governor				79.81048480336378
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light				909.6885110189422
luigi vampa s bill of fare chapter				91.03363360063089
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us asked aramis				19.03809341931617
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere				5405.029262585226
do you keep a journal no my life has been passed in frivolity i wish to forget it myself do you talk in your sleep i sleep soundly like a child do you not remember the color mounted to the baroness s face and villefort turned awfully pale				184.69039056883295
but the chief without taking the money made a sign to him to follow				30311.039738652205
there are indeed some things which appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an instant				762.6940994748811
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness				8496.811469907714
it is well madame said mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer d artagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger				256.0612905334078
he is very young but a sword thrust is a sword thrust whatever be the age of him who gives it and a youth is less to be suspected than an older man and the stranger fell into a reverie which lasted some minutes				1065.3598468354794
send me the keeper of the seals sÃ©guier and that man what has your eminence done with him what man asked the cardinal				17.662070484457036
it was the man of meung				54923.693157941714
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him				6.4233042183457405
bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of d artagnan				1.0603041653111391
bazin was making with his spare little short arms ridiculous gestures				49622.970941929234
porthos placed his hand on the pistols				1680.2770062558898
i know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the daughter of danglars what				212.0152024715726
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water				6116.936982743377
well i will avenge you of this wretch replied d artagnan giving himself the airs of don japhet of armenia				19962.37742826109
and when jacopo inquired of him what is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me edmond replied who knows				2196.620771592391
the next day mercÃ©dÃ¨s came to implore the protection of m de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent				4656.929847921733
let us go to monsieur de beaufort the two friends went to the hotel de vendome				12700.517768279184
i am a man of order sir let us do things in order nevertheless replied mordaunt i could compel you i command here ah sir said d artagnan i see that although we have had the honor of traveling in your company you do not know us				119.07149619904376
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the other well done planchet				341.1894831765216
athos pointed to the bastion				1050.20870916303
peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl				7613.769193497487
porthos would have found it very difficult even to make him see that he was dying of hunger he has gone on his road as inexorable as fate and we must seek him somewhere else they continued their route				6835.934245225229
but all these reasons were combated destroyed overthrown by that feeling of intimate pain which on certain occasions takes possession of our being and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over us				127.79289404719314
our bÃ©arnais was a prudent lad however young he might be				95.6993119866994
their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful threatenings				41972.84966333183
let us choose a place of rendezvous continued athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other good the other three exclaimed				5388.354012537572
has your husband any spanish bonds he asked of the baroness				390.28787702164357
but my dear count has m danglars any reason ah				76.573138698872
tony he said motioning to his groom to approach				809.7139382568795
you don t imagine he would consider a little thing like that at any rate said porthos i am glad to hear d artagnan admit that he is afraid i not only confess it but am proud of it returned the gascon i m not such a rhinoceros as you are				85.81896250005626
what is the matter then with this dear child				204.05701280265168
with a single glance the prince took in the extent of country that lay before him from lens as far as vimy				163904.47541574712
i will not talk here is the knife said felton drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought according to his promise but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner				247.35161133641512
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz				215.89292393626815
what this one too he exclaimed				80.6134576258559
free without my aid				5320.592674325924
you have water woods flowers there she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color				1974.566674699384
this being understood let us proceed with our history				1855.0717149479724
this manÅuvre was incomprehensible to dantÃ¨s				139.5488296949424
andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought against him				3.4291504904560286
the queen turned sharply round for there could be no deception in the expression of that voice it was a friend who spoke thus				875.2356964605864
and as for me said porthos i swear nothing but i m choked				3715.0808347862244
no one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said ali bring me my pistols with the ivory cross ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot				21753.973057560503
porthos next made an effort which shook the solid wall and by the aid of his friend s hand gained the summit				12635.473043413682
danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon				3501.3434732125256
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room				28.55521388552055
ali observed his master as the nubian entered the chamber you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not ali drew himself up proudly and then returned a sign in the affirmative				1255.1205182601232
the devil take the madman murmured m de trÃ©ville unless added he this is a cunning mode of escaping seeing that he had failed in his purpose chapter iv				109.93331165426032
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the report				9413.718550308467
holÃ  bazin				82.11448509942883
penelon said the captain i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold i gave him the helm and descended there was already three feet of water				8613.949069549231
every career is open to you				18.70765253795114
if i am a prisoner what crime have i committed you are here in the apartment destined for you madame				250.4725378379437
however we shall see				128.3627584275676
it had been handed down from father to son for the singular clause of the only will that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the family with superstitious veneration				14278.949542710046
there is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible traces				6574.179108145288
contrary to custom the door was open and having no occasion to ring he entered				268.27354766330245
he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover porthos with ridicule				5929.055254129249
no monsieur				167.01489502119747
i have come in the name of your wife and daughter and of the children you have still in london and i say to you live sire it is the will of heaven the king raised himself buckled on his belt and passing his handkerchief over his moist forehead said well what is to be done sire have you in the army one regiment on which you can implicitly rely winter said the king do you believe in the fidelity of yours sire they are but men and men are become both weak and wicked				63741.52753230005
i am a frondist from my heart				1708.5818529314824
what has he done madame said d artagnan				1.0321243999125371
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health				2135.985041519206
when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men				1074.6872473286949
ah monsieur porthos cried the procurator s wife when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her ah monsieur porthos you are a great conqueror as it appears i madame said porthos drawing himself up proudly how so the signs just now and the holy water				3101.2079211197497
i did replied the count				9.122441410782908
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor s emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone				350.0064703695639
your arrest is known that of your friends will soon be known and all the nobility of france would demand an explanation of your disappearance				1076.6281116794646
i have chosen the drawing room sir as our place of meeting in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a banker s study				845.5984434674667
bazin was then at the height of joy				300.0327856396233
dantÃ¨s was alone in darkness and in silence cold as the shadows that he felt breathe on his burning forehead				647.4774540263319
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis				51.09914655296967
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground				58.125885782362836
you are not convinced yet i hope at least that you may be mistaken shall you see the king again perhaps would you pass in his eyes for a prophet prophets of evil are not in favor at the court father true but some day they do them justice and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great man well what should i say to the king say this to him sire you are deceived as to the feeling in france as to the opinions of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as bonaparte at lyons and emperor at grenoble				16050.151809289375
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister				1060.063912697034
the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing i know but added he seriously you understand it is on the king s service at your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one				434.3874766977512
who is he come come you won t tell me you don t know aramis this is the first time i ever heard his name pronounced it is the first time then that you ever went to that house undoubtedly and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man no by a musketeer no indeed it was not he then you came to seek not the least in the world				58.085350563199306
bonacieux was the very life of d artagnan				1.087004302805618
what is to be done my god my god murmured the young woman ought i to confide such a secret to you monsieur				111.99330605835628
he now calls himself the count of morcerf and ranks among the peers thus the terrible secret which beauchamp had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another paper deriving its information from some malicious source had published two days after albert s departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the unfortunate young man almost crazy				8900.92263574794
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly francs and have those francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrel s correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision				4577.88013687793
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation				9049.200327092176
his wife				29.690246639137015
and the headsman of bethune gave me a reply de winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply				424.3242946368357
i m hit in the other side				888.7236557862873
speak you condemned me to a horrible tedious death you killed my father you deprived me of liberty of love and happiness who are you then				79.10938298630944
planchet had no need to learn more				2736.157871050451
i mean the russian prince who you said had livres and we only found you must have searched badly luigi vampa himself searched in that case he must either have paid his debts a russian do that or spent the money possibly after all certainly				633.2617636618422
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters				1791.8202845617857
d artagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold				389.42902400910816
but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years what he did during these ten years god only knows				1018.5108781798018
i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper				6734.7297308152665
i am sure he will look like the great mogul they made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses				626.5197521836959
the world excuses and notoriety ennobles you madame replied villefort you know that i am no hypocrite or at least that i never deceive without a reason				1068.9207909263368
the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward				11323.459559472092
i have sent for one replied the abbÃ©				21.990729860238382
a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest				589.0617277867312
i should be glad however to receive your excellency s commands concerning the dinner really my dear m bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so				10.970669324215248
another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention				1477.7331002144394
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming				2433.1378237360054
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him				9.692993575216477
planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by night				329.3916307364926
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her embarkation				68587.21299087888
i have warned you				5.974341705925838
by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide				28421.68269516451
villefort started madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees valentine rose pale and dumb as a statue				617.1874618927412
belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dantÃ¨s had predicted twenty fathoms to windward				30365.056921258245
i am parched with thirst				7208.7574057242155
oh fear nothing said the skipper showing his face				163.18894712625453
no that is sufficient a man can pass through that porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through				1362.0703157510357

madame replied villefort with a mournful smile i have already had the honor to observe that my father has at least i hope so abjured his past errors and that he is at the present moment a firm and zealous friend to religion and order a better royalist possibly than his son for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no other impulse than warm decided preference and conviction having made this well turned speech villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court				382.2516854743969
there is none said athos				3.774402392408219
this noirtier was his father had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dantÃ¨s or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words				993.8341286332168
they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us oh exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was d artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping aramis shook his head				10.870234671286918
well this is just what amuses me said monte cristo				1.0626708264319358
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child				445.4002313442451
at length the long desired sound was heard and instead of one figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him				5.690620884536916
there were two means of gaining his object to search him on the spot or to carry him away making a buckler of his body and search him in the trench				8185.44423366175
there edmond dantÃ¨s he said pointing to the bodies of his wife and child see are you well avenged monte cristo became pale at this horrible sight he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance and that he could no longer say god is for and with me with an expression of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the body of the child reopened its eyes felt its pulse and then rushed with him into valentine s room of which he double locked the door				87.11095372297434
i am as you have said the count andrea cavalcanti son of major bartolomeo cavalcanti a descendant of the cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at florence				5449.182844552179
counting his treasures replied the governor				79.82144585815577
lord wilmore resided in rue fontaine saint georges				6927.855466289763
at midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard				542.1944673688006
mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and disappeared				251.85353151716788
have you seen the cardinal he sent for me answered the mercer proudly				565.2207581695537
do you understand me he said				4.029013461347807
you have doubtless heard of these massacres your excellency vaguely i was far from france at that period				27535.314952528
d artagnan inquired of everyone he met with went down to the ferry came up again by the rue de seine and the red cross but nothing absolutely nothing				84.07536349559042
there was no answer and she continued i have not seen you all day				1418.2280576028381
the lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port my dear friends said morrel if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven				159.9761281111776
they reached saint german without any accident on descending the queen found the prince awaiting her bare headed to offer her his hand				18.81964885499467
richelieu slowly tore the paper which d artagnan had generously relinquished				15083.503831038386
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple				6289.155193721985
the night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted				1245.1791126756207
have i not explained your wishes grandpapa said valentine addressing noirtier				78.91873826775223
the major made a wise choice he took the full glass and a biscuit				20622.05397707302
for you				9.102998447252286
it is he who has raised all this revolt the more reason said mazarin if he has raised it he can put it down and hold madame suggested comminges who was near a window out of which he could see hold the moment is a happy one for there he is now giving his blessing in the square of the palais royal the queen sprang to the window				51.09167892831627
in the examination which precedes ordination a thesis is always a requisite ordination cried d artagnan who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him and he gazed half stupefied upon the three persons before him				4.61079449000175
the night was extremely dark				634.4471696284234
what do you propose zounds				5508.633380182212
you will find in the same way four relays on your route				2872.163928692896
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans go my dear boy said old dantÃ¨s and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son his wife said caderousse why how fast you go on father dantÃ¨s she is not his wife yet as it seems to me no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond				1320.8117354169392
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh				914.5445046503747
i have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for i am too young but as an elder brother but you may have excited jealousy				567651.9600052026
this threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended				4595.319742522052
aramis not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar apostrophized them rather sharply				11310.238640272502
oh that s nothing				818.848507018403
my friend is still so kind as to address me by that old and well beloved appellation which makes my heart glad when i hear it tis an illustrious name said the lieutenant and had one day triumphal honors paid to it what do you mean sir inquired raoul				56.167721817116785
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation				694.7051763188023
both of the visitors after saluting the old man and speaking to barrois a faithful servant who had been twenty five years in his service took their places on either side of the paralytic				4890.507615696074
the closet into which d artagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see				8882.080978469587
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime villefort tried to smile				1900.3669979428994
bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically and just touched the glass with her lips				45.412279724921
i knew very well that he was incapable of defending me but as he could serve us in other ways i wished to inform him of what oh that is not my secret i must not therefore tell you besides said d artagnan pardon me madame if guardsman as i am i remind you of prudence besides i believe we are not here in a very proper place for imparting confidences				82799.45749259427
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony				63078.63331096977
it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange death of his daughter strange				4156.536836261828
it was just five o clock in the morning when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear				1548.7026850732639
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of d artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost				498.3571867394606
ask of me as mayor what is my opinion of m morrel and i shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality				10871.661223874527
what are you thinking of asked the abbÃ© smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder				3475.5737839799785
the visitor was about fifty two years of age dressed in one of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe				3395.1820040976636
have we relations with the court				1023.7734820612502
my name is mordaunt replied the young man bowing				420.01917679160164
our duty is fulfilled not yet said aramis we have still a word to say to these gentlemen and turning to chatillon sir be so good as not to go away without giving me an opportunity to tell you something i can not say before the queen chatillon bowed in token of assent and they all went out stopping at the window of a gallery on the ground floor				425.10561608405226
trÃ©ville added the king in a low voice as the others were retiring as you have no room in the musketeers and as we have besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that corps place this young man in the company of the guards of monsieur dessessart your brother in law				5734.981423107787
let us see the dungeons let us first send for two soldiers said the governor				125.28584385445933
the hand moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion				9272.068847480943
well my lord what i foresaw has come to pass what				775.8359975471445
the commissary then instead of continuing to interrogate him made him a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle with public matters				2497.2492821360743
pray observe that i too much respect the laws of hospitality to ask your name or title				13105.825077409741
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to him				5.856180150086451
many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous opinion that there was something sinister about the room				170.82038122213297
i can not cry at my age they say that we have no more tears still i think that when one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping				3946.1761247752625
his plan is very simple				2525.2635771878413
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression				285.69460883162697
at these words he took up a silver bell and rang it the officer entered				43.28885543862694
is the countess up yet if you wish i will inquire yes ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three o clock and that i request permission to introduce someone to her the valet left the room				795.1597921086194
look out cried d artagnan i see black points and red points moving yonder				22465.41906099763
what would you not have accomplished if you had been free possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect				16811.690528947773
as for me when i have no candle i can t take two steps without knocking against something that s because you haven t served said mousqueton				132.59249325186565
and they went out together				572.1447033413924
if the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false friends why perhaps i should not hesitate				76183.85236854435
milady uttered a stifled groan				434.46764421322894
d artagnan looked with surprise at his friend				107.28506230708378
why one of them is a rich lord from touraine and the other a knight of malta of noble family				1382.0803965525884
an angel alone could have saved one of us from death that angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each other monte cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear				900.5658953293984
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantÃ¨s whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially				37543.46560021087
no no cried the abbÃ© impossible dantÃ¨s endeavored to renew the subject the abbÃ© shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further response				19587.493614567495
come said d artagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match				147404.12828204277
plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven				126.91363465637609
well sir i am waiting with impatience to hear what you wish to say to me and i madame replied athos am looking with admiration sir said madame de chevreuse you must excuse me but i long to know to whom i am talking				38257.33726714361
she had been engaged in arranging the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered she could not get out and had heard all				111.6972071099375
the king looked towards him				3.623068105774529
look said d artagnan day is declining				463723.96632726205
then certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders she started her horse and disappeared				236.06451333118088
it was a melancholy sight that of these six men traveling in silence each plunged in his own thoughts sad as despair gloomy as chastisement				30280.21180638025
tell them to order number to come downstairs the unhappy wretch who entered the bastile ceased as he crossed the threshold to be a man he became a number				5547.725711606263
as the gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the ring				1020.3279084586611
i took the wall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress but then you would be close to the sea that is what i hoped and supposing you had succeeded i should have thrown myself into the sea gained one of the islands near here the isle de daume or the isle de tiboulen and then i should have been safe could you have swum so far heaven would have given me strength but now all is lost all yes stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more and wait until you hear from me tell me at least who you are i am i am no				66.1287225169516
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance				5024.333043824103
yes but that would take too much time and i am thirsty				28948.604635340445
it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry you that he is angry but because she will marry a union with any other would have caused him the same sorrow				1247.7259224345446

is the abbÃ© at home asked he				16.50669820932114
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried d artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other why does she love what we hate most in the world the spaniards and the english spain is her country replied d artagnan and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself				2283.645017317529
i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m danglars in promoting a new railway line you m de villefort in condemning a culprit to death you m debray in pacifying a kingdom you m de chÃ¢teau renaud in pleasing a woman and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride				615403.4219024745
the people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst i opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd				155.5291289214638
the journey monte cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men together				238.61676251793034
they threw themselves into each other s arms embraced tenderly and returned together to the house				138.0918975519332
ah very well replied the cardinal quickly				149.24432331318982
and instantly grimaud sitting upon the board as if on horseback commenced his perilous descent				3311.618045565548
the first idea that occurred to milady s mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant				429.86443295438914
the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate andrea and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day				126.46466730223445
be it understood we are speaking of athos				31.142541892186678
rue de la fontaine in a room hung with red damask my father took me in his arms telling my mother i was dead wrapped me in a napkin marked with an h and an n and carried me into a garden where he buried me alive a shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of m de villefort				2.8234477404839082
it will be happier i think than ours has been				9621.980366478205
we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin				15019.698948997859
and i have the same sincerity to show you if you wish monsieur d herblay i acted in a similar way to you and you also deceived me really monsieur you say strange things said aramis				16.383022331896246
a mattress was laid upon the deck for him				17.2885550941048
i do this oh my god said he with his eyes raised to heaven as much for thy honor as for mine				776.5729126367568
the thing was discussed for a long time but finally decided in his favor				327.0058391101371
his musketeer s uniform became him marvelously				291217.9292675725
he has been hanged and quartered i hope my god my god cried d artagnan quite stunned by the relation of this horrible adventure				204.173029714535
is the committee willing to hear this witness yes yes they all said at once				126.26160920998053
because we want to know said de guiche haughtily				612.0528400733722
he remained there some time alone				260.38453997312877
oh as for that i ll take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horse s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him				3.7179921743083377
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex				8857.322067813007
i thought you would never come in what s the matter now planchet demanded d artagnan				1.0367928760259897
milady remained alone with her eyes fixed upon the door				14.586005365649035
more likely he has been speculating on the bourse and has lost money m				99.96091338892161

a loud cry could be heard by her				25.185118165911977
andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king s attorney				1351.596914917061
but these francs here they are and more besides				7059.100713205429
cromwell had given orders that no one was to be allowed admission but the sentinel who knew that mordaunt was one of the most confidential friends of the general thought the order did not extend to the young man				3.551176755180944
she was sent by her mistress to the false de wardes				68.31182923196576
when he had gone monte cristo breathed a profound sigh and said enough of this poison let me now seek the antidote then sounding his bell he said to ali who entered i am going to madame s chamber have the carriage ready at one o clock chapter				159.97551785184308
mercÃ©dÃ¨s although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed				424.7925504102613
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose				282.48629263718396
courage take courage my dear mother said the girl				1135.3011064952623
if we had only been looking for porthos porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him				7.94443069620947
compose yourself madame said he all danger is over the woman looked up at these words and with a glance far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her child who still continued insensible				11624.579259255166
but return to your question does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m de morcerf on account of loving another i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugÃ©nie yes but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate own now that you did question her on the subject				225.04487346605444
she had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent spanish genet and an andalusian mule which were beautiful to look upon				1300.4807869835106
if you were to die i should die too the count with a smile of profound tenderness extended his hand and she carried it to her lips				47.98964553163737

i have known you four days i have loved him four years				1834.7415904285353
monsieur bertuccio meanwhile the count had arrived at his house it had taken him six minutes to perform the distance but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give francs apiece for his horses				660.8654742445093
but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle				12938.100280660714
yes yes mazarin continued whilst his wonted smile full of subtlety lent a strange expression to his pale lips yes these noises prove to me indeed that the destiny of favorites is precarious but ye shall know i am no ordinary favorite				161893.15324631316
go i will ask his servant bonacieux re entered the house passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives went up to d artagnan s door and knocked				4851.7599116832835

it was this idea that had brought dantÃ¨s back to the circular rock				1067.73231932482
as for franz he examined his arms with the utmost coolness he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly				7978.514823105349
he had to contend against a strong wrist but his agility was superior to all force				2426.327654663311
see said she if everything does not second us				178.53699889719584
do you wish me for instance to give information to the procureur monte cristo uttered the last words with so much meaning that morrel starting up cried out you know of whom i speak count do you not perfectly well my good friend and i will prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the persons				10314.946308197723
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screamed				88337.31784601223
but and i say it with some pride mercÃ©dÃ¨s god needed me and i lived				1349.90747011807
it is you who surrendered the castle of yanina				1451.8624436795787
at dessert d artagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease				6113.274600310163

while he was doing this d artagnan having no better employment amused himself with beating a march upon the window and with looking at the musketeers who went away one after another following them with his eyes until they disappeared				314.7243144647758
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum				4900.213589663589
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life				457.209676993007

there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream				164128.93595644805
come here grimaud said athos				3.526598386518494
no doubt you come to join the princes as thou seest planchet said aramis whilst athos smiled on seeing what important rank was held in the city militia by the former comrade of mousqueton bazin and grimaud				233.5223028325842
franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the day both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the truth for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection				728.1551787055678
a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped peppino opened the door and the count and franz alighted				6220.901368112527
if i bore my name you would have heard one of the most illustrious names of england what is your name then asked mazarin				38.01490483614297
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance				365.3688957484349

well this is what you have to say said d artagnan my lord your sister in law is an infamous woman who wished to have you killed that she might inherit your wealth but she could not marry your brother being already married in france and having been d artagnan stopped as if seeking for the word and looked at athos				58.33399322141847
about forty leagues only				310.0521748055919

he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney				50591.225543472174
well sir at last said anne of austria you are silent after rendering such a service madame replied d artagnan i have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majesty s service and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you i know that sir i have known that said the queen a long time therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem permit me madame said d artagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of trÃ©ville he has done wonders his name asked the queen				9.116094912605952
several days elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of cucumetto				536.5473521941952
rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught all these like one of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his guests passed in review before the eyes of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined gold like lorenzo de medici				2497.0647178628005
i yesterday purchased these horses of the baron but as the baroness evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my hands you are then doubtless the count of monte cristo of whom hermine has talked to me so much you have rightly guessed madame replied the count				5.659129989538149
he causes a disturbance in your hostelry which respectable people can not put up with				252.73728251131485
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a pistol at man with whom for three years i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so i must meet him with a heart at ease and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own arm must save his life well said morcerf impatiently what does all this mean it means that i have just returned from yanina from yanina yes impossible here is my passport examine the visa geneva milan venice trieste delvino yanina				7671.574963694557
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope you re preparing a pretty trial why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume i should think not indeed				177.59121555516145
this is all very easy for you to say replied d artagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect but for me who am without any settled means and without resources for me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet this is serious answered the three friends it is a family affair				710.3462351109478
thomson french inquired the stranger				166.51725759143017
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden				182.7159843333281
madame said villefort i ask where is m d avrigny				34.731870658161405
once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling				3416.081941694773
d artagnan s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract				78794.62233139
now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts the night lighted up by his illusions and the silence animated by his anticipations				29258.01534454087
the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat				33084.88271013927
this reasoning seemed to d artagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted and about eight o clock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the hotel de la chevrette and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate				1222.55286127859
it matters little now to me				9.202180438926575
why did not the countess the proud mercÃ©dÃ¨s the disdainful catalane who will scarcely open her lips to her oldest acquaintances take your arm lead you into the garden into the private walks and remain there for half an hour ah baron baron said albert you are not listening what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you oh don t worry about me sir mocker said danglars then turning to monte cristo he said but will you undertake to speak to the father willingly if you wish it but let it be done explicitly and positively				116065.62126982647
an instant after the guardsman descended in his turn				80.97011711106985
a hoarse broken tone which was neither a cry nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale				210.12448042240635
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos				798.0268613240922
for us also inquired athos				3.448805469142129
you were seated upon cushions in the spanish fashion you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful arms those lovely arms with large diamonds				2995.111984484745

tell the count that i am well that you found me sad but resigned i am pleased sir to hear that and the same also for monsieur du vallon not for me cried porthos i am not by any means resigned but you will be resigned my friend never he will become so monsieur i know him better than he knows himself				121.62452149851939
the servant then approached athos and said hesitatingly monsieur le vicomte has no sword tis well said athos i will take care of that they went downstairs raoul looking every now and then at the count to see if the moment of farewell was at hand but athos was silent				297.7727308338518
a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought forward by morcerf				428.10321320083983
but to you d artagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend				37.961368459532984
franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a sea gull on the wave continuing her flight towards corsica				1672.7775611877412
take this said madame de villefort giving her smelling bottle to valentine				1753.6067917654016
count said villefort we will not entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes				91302.82324484766
the two friends turned off into a side street to avoid meeting the prince and so reached the saint denis gate				2277.21417601603
mordaunt went away with the captain				449.62748028184916
before the door the traces were yet more apparent these horsemen whoever they might be had halted there				262.34581148319
how madame said she i have scarcely seen you and you already wish to deprive me of your company upon which i had counted a little i must confess for the time i have to pass here no madame replied the novice only i thought i had chosen my time ill you were asleep you are fatigued well said milady what can those who sleep wish for a happy awakening				37916.091342061474
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done				114.83703782323303
they were ambitious and cÃ¦sar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments				44381.44617870248
various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended				1445.9408325353531
have you not perceived it it may be but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be won oh difficulties do not affright me said d artagnan				1.032856582807215
before he had taken ten steps beyond the door i had examined the house on all sides				958.6506053048176
bridle in mouth said d artagnan				1.0460243235293842
at that moment d artagnan passed in pursuit of milady he cast a passing glance at porthos and beheld this triumphant look				168.9546082832136
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen				53369.38785811319
the abbÃ© told us it was worth without the setting what was the abbÃ© s name asked the indefatigable questioner				7436.885752142558
you were deceived sir i was not praying do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator				125781.068898479
d artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron				39556.50592384809
yes there is the sky here is the sea				386.06640485425214
oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch shall i write your deposition				3928.5503616454675

chapter xxviii				114.76166002620641
he calls himself so				191.1540054421226
on the contrary observed d artagnan with a vexed look it would be impossible how so it is precisely this monsieur mordaunt whom we are going to join at boulogne and with whom we cross to england well suppose instead of joining this monsieur mordaunt we were to go and join our friends said porthos with a gesture fierce enough to have frightened an army				1280.3547213942716
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m de saint mÃ©ran s and he arranged mentally while dantÃ¨s awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence				15394.103804887787
it s my spanish wine that has got into your head is it not				144.58187537923212
is your love returned i suppose so said andrea with a triumphant smile since i am accepted				7847.713730260427
well said aramis when they were alone what do you think of this business my dear count bad replied athos very bad but you received it with enthusiasm as i shall ever receive the defense of a great principle my dear d herblay				795.2636892112762
this woman is certainly a great liar				219638.42055358255
we must therefore watch and play a close game for he added with a sigh we two are equal perhaps to eight others but we are not equal to the four that you know of that is true said porthos echoing d artagnan s sigh				663.5969366305978
it was done on purpose for me i am sure of it sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty				1530.7429603388714
bravo d artagnan				1.2880585292094802
it was the abode of the little abbÃ© scarron				537.127668030584
milady s robe was not the less stained with blood in a second				1233.0301291456997
you know well that i don t like to leave things half finished conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis				196.51107742917762
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all				105.80615525905912
the history of athos s imprisonment was then related to them and as they were really gentlemen they pronounced the host in the wrong				43068.14476674052
then we must fly said he				8.98262784733959
arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another				234.54675578042261
franz took the letter and read tuesday evening at seven o clock descend from your carriage opposite the via dei pontefici and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you				75.1026796570173
you are the only man of whom i have heard her speak with interest albert rose and took his hat the count conducted him to the door				21.302649471718112
you must show me the proofs against him certainly but you will find terrible charges monsieur continued dantÃ¨s i know it is not in your power to release me but you can plead for me you can have me tried and that is all i ask				694.1035353144355
he was thunderstruck				231.61554182954146
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than before instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen				5719.791439426125
but however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his life s best happiest years for it is not life it is merely existence in prison				1522.8815928557838
besides my friend d artagnan has something to say to me privately have you not d artagnan d artagnan nodded his head and bazin retired after placing on the table the spanish wine				501.1187646615267
as for me i consider the union with mademoiselle danglars a most suitable one she will enrich you and you will ennoble her albert shook his head and looked thoughtful				251.12490173195192

that s too many gentlemen too many				745010.3947971476
the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii				1716.4726120993769
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dantÃ¨s he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock				1775.9774187460555
there was a moment of frozen silence between these two				1580.255249612158
then compelled to quit rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history				3671.700785762687
oh villefort villefort murmured the count this scene must often have haunted thy sleepless hours do you wish to see anything more sir said the concierge				4931.643139353597
the host gave franz time to recover from his surprise and moreover returned look for look not even taking his eyes off him				5.177659661204272
though danglars could not see peppino the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation				7341.150397507733
we have promised and we will keep our promise				633.041972938283
you speak first oh no				78.70584413410612
well resumed the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of caderousse s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine				286.2565638124817
but i as you see am nailed to my bed ah				67.2512773442472

excellencies said he the coach is ready well then said franz let us to the colosseum by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies by the streets morbleu by the streets cried franz				31.042384653221944
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe				14828.81018806024
of this he took no heed but was as far as appearances might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams				502.9930165052167
the queen entered				23.317313374467894
i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes returned d artagnan				1.0651347627071952

a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian i can not exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a gold mine it seems to me said franz speaking in an undertone to albert that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way				395.83296519228344
here he said i am very straightforward in my dealings take your choice the woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis and the husband a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen francs				299.477914111024

my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to life partly on my sister s account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance				451.48327893962687
de winter probably condemned the son as he had done the mother then said athos woe to de winter for the child had done no harm may the devil take me if the child be not dead said porthos				10.75745397671742
now here we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse but that he did not				64.98888598609632
i beg you to return me that dispatch d artagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact				51465.01873694659
then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon				1055.9170170561001

yes said grimaud				27.64055179250972
look at aramis now aramis is mildness and grace personified				23840.853505318875

the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of his neighbor				1726.1669280414717
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majesty s service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me				7.289004554375031
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dantÃ¨s feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention				2346.151078496578
in losing sight of his guardian whom he had quitted gazing after him in front of the royal basilican raoul spurred on his horse in order not only to escape from his own melancholy reflections but also to hide from olivain the emotion his face might betray				15160.413116301192
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought in what way was the escape to be effected				1369.775443857799

felton quite bewildered almost mad stood speechless				22067.69724990812
d artagnan bent forward ready either to attack or to stand on his defense				14912.667194966145
athos followed them then porthos then aramis				26.995515179836527
do you suppose i carry francs in my pocket your excellency has francs in your pocket that will be fifty fowls at francs apiece and half a fowl for the danglars shuddered				1318.8268009976373
behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her				75.47885411376924
i have happily only myself in the world to care for but what makes you sigh my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy you are not happy porthos				254.19681411312314
we can not say how long the night seemed to milady but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness				12128.815976295798
really my dear gondy said the duchess you remind one of the apocalypse				127790.71261409705

and you i ve only thrown the fellow down but hark another shot of a carbine was heard				641.5488349276429
you will not oppose m villefort you will not displease the marchioness and tomorrow you will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband but mon dieu tell me how can i do otherwise do not appeal to me mademoiselle i shall be a bad judge in such a case my selfishness will blind me replied morrel whose low voice and clenched hands announced his growing desperation				25554.656489422367
as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure				2894.613294032561
would you have given up the letter aramis said d artagnan				1.0278921126427265
as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it				8.812475973933028
the falsehood would then lie at my door and as i am not a gentleman i may be allowed to lie be of good heart planchet you shall preserve your reputation as a veracious man				76.98916103366429
what could be his intentions towards him				5.357968082217087
independently of every selfish wish his heart palpitated with joy when he saw that tall form and martial demeanor which recalled to him a good and brave man				325.51203568333057
if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape patience said the abbÃ© in a tone which made the dying man shudder have patience caderousse looked at him with amazement				280.9725637516475
however continued faria seeing that the inspector was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the governor can be present unfortunately said the governor i know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your treasures does it not faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced anyone else of his sanity				29608.009918072275
he could not be mistaken milady was in it				59.458041662618065
she was mad with passion				42787.26295616991
what are my servants				773.8607772313007
dantÃ¨s led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces				5576.805406681239
but without taking any heed of the sword milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him and did not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat				393.9954418057058
apropos continued he franz is coming soon but it will not interest you you dislike him i think i said monte cristo my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like m franz				26.705287102845585
how many are there two				382.92486050563366
frightful murmured athos while porthos broke the bottles and aramis gave orders a little too late that a confessor should be sent for				409.0505604175627
you agree that the foundation the trademark owner and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual direct indirect consequential punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage				1174.6517697101326
were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million				2857.537478224382
suppose that the supreme being after having created the world and fertilized chaos had paused in the work to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins from her immortal eyes suppose that when everything was in readiness and the moment had come for god to look upon his work and see that it was good suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back into eternal night then even then mercÃ©dÃ¨s you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my life at this moment mercÃ©dÃ¨s looked at the count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment her admiration and her gratitude				5074.665043627144
woman siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating eye which reminds me that i ought to blush				204910.30098643294
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands				51.46010594794036
the storm still continued				417.4399020955579
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses i scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost me well somewhere about francs debray conveyed the count s reply to the baroness				303.6072601122256
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat				534.7183654659127
i noticed them for their remarkable beauty then how comes it said monte cristo with a frown that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables at the look of displeasure added to the angry tone in which the count spoke ali turned pale and held down his head				31.83691934874442
porthos was discontented with his condition				12516.356212339266
i suffer horribly				419.08610531593166
in my opinion the people are right and cheerfully would i give up five years of my pay which i am never paid by the way to make the king five years older really				30644.976748132784
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door				16.02875441410075
i make a match				17916.819333457446
i can not resist doing so he must live zounds replied d artagnan why don t you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch				1155.372847871813
everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on board				13816.448923371714
my recovery lasted six months				7169.4927106889245
milady uttered a deep inward shriek and retreated to a corner of the room like a panther which crouches for a spring				1324.3718140666967
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur d artagnan there s not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him then my lord replied d artagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me be it so				26.542306434046925
the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands had doubled pomÃ¨gue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board				18209.3846961499
if mazarin is an italian i am a gascon and d artagnan dressed himself in an instant				553.1282573754174
is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir				1021.3978625759415
but you my friend are you not going to change your dress no i shall go as i am				238.0599982992921
that she might not appear to fail in her promise to maximilian she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they should take a walk in the garden being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her part				3636.233840758096
i have already told you answered the abbÃ© that i loathe the idea of shedding blood and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self preservation no matter				1360.7855897423583
the house may be suspected but i deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur d artagnan for i can affirm sire if i can believe what he says that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your majesty or a more profound admirer of monsieur the cardinal was it not this d artagnan who wounded jussac one day in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the convent of the carmes dÃ©chaussÃ©s asked the king looking at the cardinal who colored with vexation				6488.559262652469
political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation				23017.436153423507
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns				9924.631749338925
and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver				2601.286540823
besides d artagnan from her own admission knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important and could entertain no respect for her				21.060455532355967
vanitas vanitatum according to your idea then my brain is turned				2407.2805225430798
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest d artagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the bastille go to				271.3558949565228
speak then i am all ears d artagnan related his adventure with mme				40.15355086530371
you say you fear nothing but death i did not say that i feared it i only said that death alone could check the execution of my plans and old age my end will be achieved before i grow old and madness i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom non bis in idem				189039.20408227167
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night s adventure i don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one				208.76135733500837
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that everyone rose with the exception of carlini who remained seated and ate and drank calmly				7724.35172160319
that is the least we owe her that s true said athos but that concerns aramis well replied the latter blushing what must i say oh that s simple enough replied athos				4.5760987952682
how said bonacieux astonished				16.4683127183954
here are two other cavaliers as he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed				667.1119152974965
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine chapter lii				133.64988973462332
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to find their masters				634.4163125243236
never fear quarrels but seek adventures				1207041.751009345
on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage it stopped				864.0738085180237
if on the sixteenth day after your departure at eight o clock in the evening you are not here no money even if it be but five minutes past eight then monsieur said planchet you must buy me a watch take this said athos with his usual careless generosity giving him his own and be a good lad				7423.903879736396
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father				4018.8875486443685
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe				708.9929865558689
general de quesnel accepted the condition and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road they took				16139.39165754574
with francs we can reach marseilles with francs are you sure albert oh as for that i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are made				329.5452772734041
now i travel a great deal particularly on this road and i wish to see all innkeepers making a fortune it seems to me said the host that this is not the first time i have had the honor of seeing monsieur bah i have passed perhaps ten times through chantilly and out of the ten times i have stopped three or four times at your house at least				804.5770029117701
the rendezvous d artagnan ran home immediately and although it was three o clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse he met with no misadventure				55650.40291631262
oh sir said she clasping her hands				50.12279616194444
i have one or two visits to make and a letter yet to write				626.6834874235348
taste this and the mines of peru guzerat and golconda are opened to you				28.85506711250121
and now sir resumed mousqueton when he had rid himself of planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend s fat back now sir allow me to leave you for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded you this dear friend said d artagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me forgotten he cried mousqueton there s not a day sir that we don t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of monsieur de gassion or of monsieur de bassompierre on d artagnan s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life s disillusions				105811.26121479574
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets villefort went immediately				678.2956299294536
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young can not resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching				23652.45763177006
as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france				148.6630419413273
at this moment grimaud came in				133.68851523060113
athos took a pistol from his belt looked to see if it was properly primed cocked it and placed the muzzle close to grimaud s ear				1931.5833847833253
come planchet let us pay a visit to the king s treasurer and then set off toward paris sir toward paris and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain				44026.199054716446
did i not tell you that she was the goddaughter of monsieur laporte the confidential man of the queen				22.537519326951347
patience cried athos one of our party is still wanting the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment for they sought vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be				79.30351337831489
what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize you your father s name so well known in italy and so highly honored				16112.60153493203
don t you say dear d artagnan that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her i believe so at least in that case porthos will assist us and how so if you please why by your marchioness your duchess your princess				814.2416232147455
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides				5618.583353983095
he was discovered all hope of flight was gone				382.6727828528762

when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodiÃ¨re he arrived at m danglars door just at the same time that villefort s landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honorÃ© stopped to leave the baroness at her own house				188.5766987682382

i m not the man you take me for you are in captain rogers s post are you not				58.858102747158306
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes				47.1677170473993

he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations				10262.3050534279

ah my friend cried the duke you are so good if i could but do as you do and eat pates and drink burgundy at the house of father marteau s successor tis true my lord answered la ramee that his pates are famous and his wine magnificent in any case said the duke his cellar and kitchen might easily excel those of monsieur de chavigny well my lord said la ramee falling into the trap what is there to prevent your trying them				51.53362545903383
for a long time i had these words whispered in my ears and i chose the latter at any rate it is a french word				1715.9341381062884
he was approached to be examined and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and his laced coat that he was an officer of the musketeers he was surrounded with the intention of making him cry down with mazarin the demonstration did not fail to make him uneasy at first but when he discovered what it meant he shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were satisfied				1878.516355611444
winter s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp				379.7960215178235
a vast crowd filled the apartments of saint germain				56.83181447731275
meddle with your musketeers and do not annoy me in this way				394.78077553335027
i have always been an honest man and as far as lay in my power i have done good i do not deny it returned the count but why are you thus agitated				18093.59442254836
laugh as much as you will replied albert i am in love you alarm me cried franz				22.658301882032173
have you anything to ask of me				7.8663162966042055
how many guns gentlemen twelve replied aramis				17.549773038206897
tell him all this for me for these are things which a king can not say for himself thanks sire thanks said the duke but your majesty may be assured that it is not those i do not speak of monsieur de trÃ©ville whom your majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you ah				191.4510181781246
as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the cafÃ© de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted				589.1923545000117
she was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair and her gloves were on her hands				71.10768670874523
they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious				11106.488088354321
when he was completely dressed he said send hither monsieur d artagnan the valet went out of the room this time by the centre door but still as silently as before one might have fancied him an apparition				5811.787995869148
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing ah said a gallant old general who in had sung partant pour la syrie we will not go alone to the garden then said mercÃ©dÃ¨s i will lead the way turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on mercÃ©dÃ¨s				464.02496492297126
she worries me everywhere said d artagnan				1.0401253682653768
d artagnan then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked for nothing had led him to the examination that the ground trampled here and hoofmarked there presented confused traces of men and horses				303.11905018388006
poor woman poor woman what have they done with you you have promised to be secret my good monsieur said the old man				1.960985342151887
stop my friend i have an idea speak monsieur in your place i would do one thing what while his eminence was seeking for me in paris i would take without sound of drum or trumpet the road to picardy and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions				725.744669053109
remember raoul this				132.4001758749656
at the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness				960.839506544527
whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols ready also				321.21339809177067
there was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither mme				28.76206773425752
poor things here i am in their name said m de boville but did you receive my letter yesterday yes i have brought my receipt my dear m de boville your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twenty four hours since m de monte cristo whom you just saw leaving here you did see him i think yes well well m de monte cristo has just carried off their five millions how so the count has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by thomson french of rome he came to demand five millions at once which i paid him with checks on the bank				255.8847954555566
gondy bowed respectfully				628.6396607135415
although the musketeer was not expected before one o clock the procurator s wife had been on the watch ever since midday reckoning that the heart or perhaps the stomach of her lover would bring him before his time				176.7209599200112
i saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mother s servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction				15627.864104552034
at drake s or aaron s one pays twenty five lire for common days and thirty or thirty five lire a day more for sundays and feast days add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and there s an end of it i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage then they must put horses to mine				1673.3575478076614
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night				307.15972155892956
it was the second time he had been worsted and this time on his own ground				423.3154465442835
go said he the enemy will not rally for fifteen days and until that time i have no need of your service				291.7873812465505
what word then can be found to describe the days which they occupy in descending				1370.2784692678322
raoul gives me much uneasiness he said				10.239059641953455
all these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes because you do not love me madame				116.54027076420793
and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel				4024.7328451809667
his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercÃ©dÃ¨s exercised over him				6.335639089430291
ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may to be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said aramis				16.07241386308854
i pardon you and i weep for you				6.723254212878655
go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister de longueville that i thank her for the present that she made me of you and i came sir added raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for i thought you would be glad to see me again athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter				2622.8177841726083
my clothes were near me on a chair i neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed				574.3599127890471
although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other paper beauchamp as it sometimes we may say often happens was his intimate friend				311.3623231074097
all this savors of his eminence a league off but what is to be done said d artagnan				1.0422993908719773
this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy				79958.70817787941
as you will replied the duke				12.44259360886157
albert beauchamp and chÃ¢teau renaud remained alone				93.27997276232281
in the rue de vaugirard in the rue de la harpe that s well said the cardinal				22.123177284991872
have you traded it for your diamond no				356.8448937658302
peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly				1868.062630728275
athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window which was without shutters but had the half curtains closely drawn				19713.351718776652
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant				13654.531780423347
at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me i have great power more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs Ã©lysÃ©es				47.29760299686546
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face				130.71485413316793
ah yes that is the name certainly				3149.570225023014
it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formed it was none of these things that attracted the attention it was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdain these were what fixed the attention of all upon him				6.880481571566323
he still lives are you quite sure of it i am he there was a moment of cold silence during which everyone was affected according to his nature				2742.8395655569116
come cheer up is there anything that i can do for you i wish to see the governor i have already told you it was impossible why so because it is against prison rules and prisoners must not even ask for it what is allowed then better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not care to walk about but i wish to see the governor if you worry me by repeating the same thing i will not bring you any more to eat well then said edmond if you do not i shall die of hunger that is all the jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die and as every prisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer he replied in a more subdued tone				715.7554144027786
on guard but said he whom d artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st germain or in the prÃ© aux clercs what you say is full of sense replied d artagnan but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely				2906.0214739135454
is he rich he s the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in london and knows lansquenet adores it basset his mania biribi revels in it good said porthos we shall pass an agreeable evening the more so as it will be the prelude to a better how so we invite him to play to night he has invited us in return to morrow				586.372777628251
and for what kind of talent are they celebrated				110176.66402483752
then he said to himself i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody				40354.002439067786
his arms became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless				6610.435651140402
oh for pity s sake you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel one of my friends had not stopped him listen to me my son has also guessed who you are he attributes his father s misfortunes to you madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunes it is a punishment				758.0079794047077
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantÃ¨s who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father				204.86280033763703
you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled has he eaten anything lately asked madame de villefort eluding her husband s question				185.55051441489158
the islands of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the chÃ¢teau d if dantÃ¨s nevertheless determined to make for them				26.529849173858718
however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh				2894.7292381254633
did he take baptistin with him no my lord call him then i wish to speak to him the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an instant				500.6313007766533
besides the pleasure there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you men to fear from all this				1288.010247495185
felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness then seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged he went out				54.31952700852012
now hastily interrupted the jesuit on seeing that his acolyte was going astray now your thesis would please the ladies it would have the success of one of monsieur patru s pleadings please god cried aramis transported				1790.8533573995603
morrel seized their hands and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs on your knees on your knees he is our benefactor the saviour of our father				133.75419143869954
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact but the feeling in dauphinÃ© is quite the reverse of that in provence or languedoc				5741.07746593155
the next morning he could not see or hear the jailer feared he was dangerously ill edmond hoped he was dying				1000.7432843177743
for more than a month past the mischievous child who knew not what to wish for had taken it into his head to have a monkey				28188.188599446818
well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier				1130.9003316559815
these men are going to behead your father				44.924556901516375
in former days i had not only three friends i had thirty at two and twenty one calls every man one s friend well sir returned mazarin prudence is a fine thing but to day you might regret having been too prudent my lord pythagoras made his disciples keep silence for five years that they might learn to hold their tongues but you have been silent for twenty years sir				493.1504239766951
it was one of the gascon s artifices to hide his deep cunning occasionally under an appearance of rough loyalty				8598.691096027693
the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of france				88.6627562084889
in the time of the cardinal people fired better than that do you remember the road to crevecoeur mousqueton ah sir				33.67671343370491
come courage				155.64768506920538
gentlemen said d artagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said porthos and that will be a pity				2249.5722566217796
a poor musketeer a beggar an unknown who hates slavery and finds himself ill placed in the world aramis aramis cried d artagnan looking at his friend with an air of doubt				1904.201222744991
thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it the devil it does				173.89025423561324
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut i wish we were already there said d artagnan and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our horses come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five o clock in the morning				175.5664957361073
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for heretics in truth said athos aramis is right				278.8907907958381
maximilian rushed up the little staircase while noirtier s eyes seemed to say quicker quicker in a minute the young man darted through several rooms till at length he reached valentine s				191.71987607605618
i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her thank you sir said d avrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it				6.639264562992003
tell him to come to me immediately if he has returned the count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your eminence instantly let him come in then said the cardinal quickly				101.24991413229156
i do not remember if it is exactly francs which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference				31940.640772922095
wretch she cried will you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it				11.132608365859078
besides with these men s clothes will you dress here certainly shall you have time do not be uneasy you little coward				5611.6646954194075
beauty has always been and always will be all powerful				755.9519742618336
a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of this gentleman				786.9890393062357
at least that will conciliate us all said aramis				13.672271404740568
one might think you really suspected us monseigneur and we were undergoing a real interrogatory				14660.452763679628
at the end of two hours as porthos did not come not any news of him they resumed their journey				351.7812215988528
still further he had seldom seen the young musketeer but every time he had seen him he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance				120.38089707927637
in the home of the witty abbÃ© dwelt incessant laughter there all the items of the day had their source and were so quickly transformed misrepresented metamorphosed some into epigrams some into falsehoods that every one was anxious to pass an hour with little scarron listening to what he said reporting it to others				323.9635681111577
take care that no misfortune befalls you when you leave i thank your majesty said aramis but under these robes i have a coat of mail a pistol and a dagger go then sir and god keep you the king accompanied him to the door where aramis pronounced his benediction upon him and passing through the ante rooms filled with soldiers jumped into his carriage and drove to the bishop s palace				1524.9613002413776
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted				8956.218534236048
finally d artagnan had entire faith in the bravery of planchet and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne				538.9728627117556
the three cavaliers continued their road on full gallop				563.256426636876
i know nothing about it you don t know i quit the seminary not at all this is my story then				151.188515894475
i had but one gerfalcon and he died day before yesterday indeed sire i wholly comprehend your disappointment				22976.862351351923
the good george said she closing the window with an expression of countenance full of affection and melancholy				1758.6461794388438
the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face				166.48375348056976
but fernand instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling				2133.3710905091943
you will accompany monsieur le vicomte till grimaud rejoins you				13.916623471249085
but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here and he glanced timidly at the count s blue coat				714.6388739829565
now my dear friend look upon all i tell you as merely the statement of a monk of a man who resembles an echo repeating simply what he hears				747248.9757192996
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go on i listen sire said blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire mala ducis avi domum continued louis xviii still annotating				27556.067950133536
oh oh replied d artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution we must fly said the queen				9.431726002224863
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz				219.15904246143572
my young vicomte replied scarron i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive raoul blushed again				97.34889974973484
all at once she uttered a loud cry of joy and darted toward the door she had recognized the voice of d artagnan				1.0648174306426919
my friend said she how came you here				133.41798928798318
however much of a jew he may be he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles				510.6602120670032
it was the marquis de saint mÃ©ran				37.347276860354675
i wrote to franz and were he here he would confirm every word i wrote then to franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten minutes past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the honor of being and signor luigi vampa such was the name of the chief of these bandits would have scrupulously kept his word but franz did come with the four thousand crowns said chÃ¢teau renaud				4.116020638768297
although la rochelle was invested however certain success might appear thanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city the blockade might last a long time yet				4685.896208192672
the couple then although they had not seen each other for eight days and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were concerned accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation				392.9962942134663
at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for mercy				6264.325439006997
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing				86494.65558647973
that is all i require				2684.5168388954157
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles				215.1547294069632
but excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile quite the contrary				6824.261717336426
overturn the world change its character yield to mad ideas be even criminal but live count i have your word said morrel coldly then taking out his watch he added it is half past eleven morrel can you intend it in my house under my very eyes then let me go said maximilian or i shall think you did not love me for my own sake but for yours and he arose				503.5420830677242
you think so do you and he took his friend along the alley where a number of tracks like those which had trampled down the flowerbeds were visible				270.119269860665
go on said the abbÃ© it seems as if i were listening to the story of a dream				304.92986708506936
yes i am a man of honor said d artagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess it for i do possess it do i not entirely go on well i feel as if transformed a confession weighs on my mind a confession if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not without doubt then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me perhaps d artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to milady s but she evaded him				8.21631668591161
if so you can spare yourself the trouble no said mazarin although perhaps that counsel is as good as any other then what may it be to call for monsieur le coadjuteur the coadjutor cried the queen that dreadful mischief maker				388325.93165663315
the prisoner did not understand or seemed not to understand what raoul said to him and raoul could hardly understand his replies containing a mixture of flemish and alsatian				10945.210828800464
do you know sir asked the baroness that you are improving				123710.49841458697
our position is truly a strange one continued athos laughing				36.676129515410324
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway				11905.242802886572
you do not know that i remained for fourteen years within a quarter of a league of you in a dungeon in the chÃ¢teau d if				15.463213470326998
ah said groslow				462.49104623150095
mercÃ©dÃ¨s drew near and plucked the fruit				1479.9988374754782
d artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white object which she unfolded quickly and which took the form of a handkerchief				1784.3921349110785
to come in the capacity of a cousin and seat himself every day at a good table to smooth the yellow wrinkled brow of the old procurator to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them bassette passe dix and lansquenet in their utmost nicety and winning from them by way of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour their savings of a month all this was enormously delightful to porthos				177.9729486904912
a woman with athos				26.332060813009953
sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison				1530.6356665761941
your eminence said comminges as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door				72.44698361485545
no my lord and i will set out at once				35.36969091870635
well laporte asked the queen				8.751598956713359
athos invited d artagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine o clock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve				146946.7038370509

you understand my dear baron that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases it was perhaps some plot against you andrea looked steadily at monte cristo and disappeared in the second drawing room				92.30068784724195
violence he said to himself would spoil all d artagnan my friend prove to this young serpent that thou art not only stronger but more subtle than he is ah he said making a low bow why did you not begin by saying that monsieur mordaunt				49.67769121991514

that was the question				248.08514424295146

the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands				65.36740045491374
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no one would be able to discover its real meaning				2506.2965161894945
in leaving the palais royal he remembered to have observed a similar shadow				840.9445131290823
as soon as the noise of the hoofs was lost in the distance d artagnan remounted the bank of the stream and scoured the plain followed by his three friends directing their course as well as they could guess toward london				197.08660387147046

ah he said wiping with his sleeve large drops of sweat from his forehead how lucky it was that mousqueton was thirsty he made haste to pass out by the opening still thinking himself in a dream but the sight of the gunpowder in the tankard proved to him that his dream was a fatal nightmare				10366.730469675238
i feel the blood flowing towards my brain				688.9713183315678
mordaunt said the cardinal raising his voice as if to arouse the dreamer my reply to this letter will be more satisfactory to general cromwell if i am convinced that all are ignorant of my having given one go therefore and await it at boulogne sur mer and promise me to set out to morrow morning i promise my lord replied mordaunt but how many days does your eminence expect me to await your reply if you do not receive it in ten days you can leave mordaunt bowed				301.99590448142663
it is understood of course that when we say the queen mazarin is meant				2405.8724847443245
he took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol				1858.4139630657241
but as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the event that is to say till two o clock in the afternoon two vessels had already left the port the one bearing as we know milady who already anticipating the event was further confirmed in that belief by seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral s ship				225316.8749161479

mazarin wiped his forehead and looked around him				3.8397664294198255

he turned towards the sailor who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office and asked him how these men had landed as no vessel of any kind was visible				441.6758190323922
on entering he found a man of short stature and intelligent eyes but covered with rags				8714.556710586277

he will treat me better the next time i see him you have the means then of touching him i have the means of making myself feared mazarin looked at the young man but at the fire which shot from his glance he bent his head then embarrassed how to continue such a conversation he opened cromwell s letter				211.77836412683388

all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep				193.9133155209353

what do you say cried d artagnan				1.038695454131479
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine no				20.606511314292142

the baroness was partially reclining on a sofa eugÃ©nie sat near her and cavalcanti was standing				3577.0847379548854

jussac anxious to put an end to this springing forward aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary but the latter parried it and while jussac was recovering himself glided like a serpent beneath his blade and passed his sword through his body				499.8379486433566

i looked into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of chairs his back was turned towards me so that i could not see the expression of his countenance neither should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his head was buried between his two hands				170.18435746769083
his thin face deeply furrowed by care and the bold outline of his strongly marked features betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength				3786.13298357331
he was well known at the hÃ´tel of the musketeers where everyone considered him a good comrade				27496.792651441803
and blood too				470.4476160646899

scarron was heated the cold seized on him and when he reached the farther bank he found himself crippled				12156.863485253036
albert instantly rose to meet him but franz remained in a manner spellbound on his chair for in the person of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the box at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of monte cristo				1.115256787042063
it is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe				2132.083614567385
scarcely had he shut her door when mercÃ©dÃ¨s called a confidential servant and ordered him to follow albert wherever he should go that evening and to come and tell her immediately what he observed				734.7331204508558
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated				86616.98883381936
as he said he was ready to go to the end of the world to seek her but the world being round has many ends so that he did not know which way to turn				101118.15772756666
mazarin who was sitting at a table folding up papers as if he had only been a secretary of state looked up				192.5189861937883
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of felton the only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination				1427.0052843917622
franz and the count advanced and the bandit saluted them				59.32720050354572

your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actÃ¦on and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf s remark				26324.216941802264
hark ye my friend i have disobeyed my first order but i will not disobey the second and if you move i will blow your brains out and he levelled his carbine at dantÃ¨s who felt the muzzle against his temple				10731.88384365344
here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my child				1017.5089611491899
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice				19133.74981369522
more than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service				656.2280524401177

as d artagnan pursued his investigations a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish his respiration was broken and short				7289.219010332522
no all is over said porthos				11.286349627732335
if he comes out we shall catch him				18.42956933372388
i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning				330.60720434203296
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that				154.52887232094946
what has the count done				144.49854850955316
a quarter of an hour later he was with the marshal				3408.6036467475064
but said the abbÃ© i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn				72.99322653325349
from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no one so much the worse that has naturally led me to love no one so much the better now you have my profession of faith then said danglars pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal love then mademoiselle you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin your ruin				58975.73700256744

almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning				717.6086728011804
one is for seven o clock and the other for eight there will be time for both hum				14792.693517717667
but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious				7910.712474005377
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls				20342.51541580639
d artagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice				138.91850714780375
attend to yourself answer me dantÃ¨s waited expecting a question but in vain				112.46970613193486
he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at present				1608.3393378819221
are you sure of it certain replied grimaud				62.26352554920908

from the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of teresa and had sworn she should be his				537.9073578134934
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it				6.07955728915688
the moccoli or moccoletti are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with first how to keep his own moccoletto alight and secondly how to extinguish the moccoletti of others				281.4201389501281

about three months ago i was near having a duel with aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house for a handkerchief marked in the same manner i am sure monsieur said the young woman you weary me very much i assure you with your questions but you madame prudent as you are think if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief and that handkerchief were to be seized would you not be compromised in what way				1087.9299608080023
what is the king doing they asked				43.895286522150556
at the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage which instead of stopping this time at the end of the rue fÃ©rou drove up to the green door				96.57515947961147
let him pass d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard				390.5010240108638
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle mercÃ©dÃ¨s burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him				5.829568765260315
that is not probable it is possible said milady				37.98085960913035
my only fear is the chance of dantÃ¨s being released				5054.268606464404
then they departed without knowing whether they would ever see each other again				512.620012786212
i have it still the carriage entered by the porta del popolo turned to the left and stopped at the hÃ´tel d espagne				117.11249356848109
if you like replied the latter				138.34788562789774
but go on what about the club in the rue saint jacques why they induced general quesnel to go there and general quesnel who quitted his own house at nine o clock in the evening was found the next day in the seine and who told you this fine story the king himself well then in return for your story continued noirtier i will tell you another my dear father i think i already know what you are about to tell me ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor not so loud father i entreat of you for your own sake as well as mine				704.8394504340279
of this treaty at least i have been warned				65417.48428882122
i think i hear a noise she said leave me good bye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl s heart was filled with gratitude				1155.5546673294496
they had not looked carefully enough for their lost friends				288.03750745402806
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme				50.90660481672651
upon my soul everything degenerates and i don t know whether it is the game which leaves no scent or the dogs that have no noses				43305.83042453599
but aramis bent his head the instant he saw the duke s finger press the trigger and the ball passed without touching him				25.32923100615573
d artagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions				26732.261311325667
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover				2881.121057361938
ah ah said he what does this mean this is the gentleman i am going to fight with said athos pointing to d artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture				246.76281692771929

the antechamber of m de trÃ©ville chapter iii				114.25887869879277
morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might				1379.240932676046
well yes planchet to be sure said athos what is there so astonishing in that				112.38966543207954
i am fifteen years younger than he is				86.36857428630285
seated opposite to him monte cristo watched him in the shadow and morrel saw nothing but the bright eyes of the count				27.242833530805065
well then said mordaunt i choose for my adversary the man who not thinking himself worthy to be called comte de la fere calls himself athos athos sprang up but after an instant of motionless silence he said to the astonishment of his friends monsieur mordaunt a duel between us is impossible				309.60969686640897

he traversed a corridor crossed a grand saloon entered a library and found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing				32364.18168366225
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given				1264.6418892248166
bonacieux who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband				406.19682990666416
we know the count s vigorous and daring mind denying anything to be impossible with that energy which marks the great man				533.9578107118163
why you must have lost your senses whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel listen to me franz said albert i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us				65.28024605201378

how replied d artagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed				262.47231426287726
at the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore and holding a spy glass in his hand				11.800940431983246
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber				141.42908692994394
he was carried home in the arms of the people				514.5328645608976
at the language you use what do you find so astonishing in that language said milady smiling				19.545254960332144
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no one had seen him				5.825972871781964

we consider it useless to draw a physical or moral portrait of grimaud if as we hope our readers have not wholly forgotten the first part of this work they must have preserved a clear idea of that estimable individual who is wholly unchanged except that he is twenty years older an advance in life that has made him only more silent although since the change that had been working in himself athos had given grimaud permission to speak				241.75217512651224

bricconi muttered he				241.69246931488118
he was compelled then after having swallowed the contents of his bottle to pass the time as well as to evade suspicion to fall into the easiest position in his corner and to sleep whether well or ill d artagnan be it remembered was only twenty years old and at that age sleep has its imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon even with the saddest hearts				8347.166267230949

whatever happens let us not leave england before the crisis				21810.288788646496
since my brother s assassination in the streets of nÃ®mes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard				578.4193417695443

have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed				29441.09680335997
a recollection of athos came into her mind				121.98334343922103
he was leaning on the shoulder of his favorite selim and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock				22112.653856162382
we do not think ourselves worthy to stand near such great names but you i presume have decided to assert your pretensions viva voce i believe you madame to be a great and powerful queen and that it will be unworthy of your power and greatness if you do not recompense the arms which will bring back his eminence to saint germain it is my intention so to do come let us hear you				10.068934762900929

it was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled				8026.051745554631
when once in the saddle grimaud reflected on two things first that at the pace he was going his horse would not carry him ten miles and secondly that he had no money				190.1183567768339

dantÃ¨s had but one resource which was to break the jug and with one of the sharp fragments attack the wall				131.68473191434978

parbleu that s good said albert with a gloomy tone				1173.6255226848975

it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp				901.5747458522682

it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind				168.11962014934556
the sound of his voice was at once penetrating and melodious and then that which was inconceivable in athos who was always retiring was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the usages of the most brilliant society those manners of a high degree which appeared as if unconsciously to himself in his least actions				1029.8442705264747
the next morning d artagnan ran to find athos				51.60243931574104
the young man stamped impatiently and ordered all sail to be spread				1110.0234934476878

albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there				98.35843226774168
but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of d artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer				1104.816313639737
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queen s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty				14581.337129235091
i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own i went away with rather a heavy heart for the horse had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his head against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful way imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him				8.144232973975837

it was in the time of the other cardinal who was a great nobleman but our mazarin impossible				113.14520882220987
god will respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest				16611.059413462175
athos walked in the direction indicated and reached the suburb situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his friends had entered it				13.02356049835527

what do you say to this project the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king				1404.3866493644584

just so				40.95567237350657
when the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brows				12715.448716110648
while he was speaking albert had heard the report of two or three pistol shots				39748.22985567522

it seems to me that it is neither your majesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission how did they act with regard to the marÃ©chale d ancre cried the king in the highest state of choler first her closets were thoroughly searched and then she herself the marÃ©chale d ancre was no more than the marÃ©chale d ancre				117.78324576556919
aramis blushed				35.12964338000445

he saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest then after having led monte cristo around the little garden he returned to the house				96.05893508581144
villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business he soon however returned his whole face beaming with delight				895.1090656388668
alas sir said he i can not but perceive how sadly i miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you i certainly am surprised replied m de trÃ©ville that you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport the sole resource of us poor bÃ©arnese i had one sir and thank god such as i could wish cried d artagnan but it was perfidiously stolen from me he then related the adventure of meung described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted m de trÃ©ville				17.28655196056825

yes yes said valentine you mean that i have yet a kind grandfather left do you not the old man intimated that such was his meaning				2177.5174935957734
the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow and knitted his brow like a man disquieted				21527.470872344984
in short you will find your father a very presentable person i assure you ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that i have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects he is a millionaire his income is francs then said the young man with anxiety i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position one of the most agreeable possible my dear sir he will allow you an income of livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in paris then in that case i shall always choose to remain there you can not control circumstances my dear sir man proposes and god disposes andrea sighed				312.64028840002294
true i forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants the street of saint honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day				301.44228950288
that is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me				10.155743599014983
at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also				169.74152976679972

they had seen no one				1484.2753063247035
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom				1383.8721341029955
what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will no sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses				2273.75725153476
but if he annoys you this young fool to be sure he does				300.90145461567306

five minutes after the new telegram reached the minister debray had the horses put to his carriage and drove to danglars house				313.61887727464307
undoubtedly madame said d artagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own				105.91680453140766

franz and albert looked inquiringly at each other then at the gorgeous furnishings of the apartment				232.34893691297728
the youth s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day				191.71009447538057
it looks as if you were trying to fleece me i				81.3256399894833

fighting here are you				255.31440016645627
aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls				1206.8649505278795
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china				2862.5165908808904
the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms				387.07008169894567

but be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody you hear him cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him				8.772483013343333
these arcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and franz were and on the other into a large square chamber entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken				909.6451347246774
on the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the stranger				481.4014540065617

the count took out his watch				241.48925740756948
is he prosperous and happy he died a more wretched hopeless heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head				34.57462070839491
the duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter ah				547.7032801497529

this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe				56539.87043727397
supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say well supposing the assertion to be really true a son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father s honor ma foi we live in times when there is much to which we must submit that is precisely the fault of the age and do you undertake to reform it yes as far as i am personally concerned well you are indeed exacting my dear fellow yes i own it are you quite impervious to good advice not when it comes from a friend and do you account me that title certainly i do well then before going to beauchamp with your witnesses seek further information on the subject from whom from haydÃ©e why what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair what can she do in it she can declare to you for example that your father had no hand whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier or if by chance he had indeed the misfortune to i have told you my dear count that i would not for one moment admit of such a proposition you reject this means of information then i do most decidedly then let me offer one more word of advice do so then but let it be the last you do not wish to hear it perhaps on the contrary i request it do not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp visit him alone that would be contrary to all custom your case is not an ordinary one and what is your reason for advising me to go alone because then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp explain yourself i will do so				10.742959936435547
now what is it they want to know				182.31851388423547
but it s of no importance continued d artagnan with natural assurance it s of no importance				1896.5748588538568
if you want another uniform and sword you must play the same trick over again				136.3167045427793
for soon perhaps i shall not hear and i shall die without knowing what she has written to me laporte made no further objection and read my lord by that which since i have known you have suffered by you and for you i conjure you if you have any care for my repose to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against france to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause and of which it is generally whispered your love for me is the concealed cause				1498.658236232806
it was a grain of a reddish color which dissolved immediately				2126.464853136419
there is here no question of crime or treason				6537.840843272446
by notre dame				29.908852210960692
his remarkably noble and austere expression struck morrel who began his story with trembling				1825.1658104732542
the antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the prisoner				128.60383853582482
sir said d avrigny to villefort call mademoiselle valentine s maid if you please villefort went himself to find her and d avrigny approached noirtier				70.10604749801142
around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles				12380.355629695614
there was another thing that planchet had no liking for and that was starting on a journey with a hungry stomach				8524.041213883102
why i lived almost on the same floor with the poor old man				14.978129881927712
would he not one day make you pay for keeping this terrible secret				3304.746613715622
we need not say that a smile of condescension was stamped upon his lips				56.372500972941666
yes madame said the young man				1.64025625597415
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the chÃ¢teau d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair dantÃ¨s remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve nay be not discouraged				10170.486562418873
during the daytime valentine s perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter s room and watched her with his paternal tenderness villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child				594.8932382943478
as for the ladies it is needless to say that while they coveted the millions they thought they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them				274.05032778756424
what is the matter sir asked monte cristo advancing to meet the commissioner				10857.279926804329
the watchword is king and rÃ© saying these words the cardinal saluted the three friends with an inclination of his head and took the right hand followed by his attendant for that night he himself slept in the camp				265.4342106565387
the others followed				242.2361281894256
ah indeed said d avrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to you noirtier did not let him finish				43189.7689894693

the coachman entered and traversed the half circle without slackening his speed and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel				4480.247233012621
the dinner it was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining room				26.340022587030454
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage				248.59481397357524
yes i should expect so besides if they forget i shall take the liberty of reminding them the queen s voice				73.43075473709251
my terror overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself				942.2664208161616
all gazed at him searchingly				23834.351778869506
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance				176.82801157389113
at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention				519.3652254395948

stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed				6191.243460927298
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said d artagnan				1.0370781424142046
then seated on a chair she looked at the manly countenance of monte cristo on which grief and hatred still impressed a threatening expression				305.68937305626054
do you want anything d artagnan shook his head and set off at full speed				518.1813113575619
i see				89.9691985026995
but said he did you observe one very singular thing what how attentively he looked at you at me yes albert reflected				321.3290596056528
you have seen my dear albert i ask the question as a mother you have seen m de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be what does he appear to be why you have just said a man of high distinction i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such but what is your own opinion albert i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese i do not ask you of his origin but what he is ah				65.03178907746904
but whom are you seeking debray i am seeking the count of monte cristo said the young man				1.7760991992498638

albert was triumphant in his harlequin costume				1010.5842817589411
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather no no no replied the eye of the paralytic				4074.2999668135235
i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers				21554.54668357032

when i saw her weeping i began to cry too				1462.2339970973492
however as far as ali is concerned i can assure you the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant you who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in paris really				768.4165216793111
the major seated himself therefore by the side of danglars who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man and yet who being able to allow his son francs a year might be supposed to possess a fortune of or livres				1037.771489469087
even his breathing seemed to be arrested				1223.1616216038783

eugÃ©nie closed her eyes but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage				75.36355472951658
as a further precaution they had bound his hands				61.800377534605815
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily				75071.78767766237
and to you also m morrel my thanks are due				920.6956346755219

while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief				1741.7008195930248
well he asked that will do will it not yes my lord on one condition what that grimaud shall wait on us at table nothing could be more agreeable to the duke however he had presence of mind enough to exclaim to the devil with your grimaud				22613.693768263747

he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate				25072.71983881167

diplomat or not i don t know i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly				2082.7396342023562
he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act my lord said d artagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d herblay who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis				67.71370787207557
fie pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher higher				97069.16963774325

this rough appeal marked by the eloquence which characterized mazarin when he spoke in italian or spanish and which he lost entirely in speaking french was uttered with such impenetrable expression that gondy clever physiognomist as he was had no suspicion of its being more than a simple warning to be more subdued				3435.494917364565
can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities he resolved to end his anxiety				5110.770299321531
dantÃ¨s struck with the sharp end of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices				8185.998496029649
so the two swords were crossed close to the hilts and as d artagnan stood firm it was his adversary who made the retreating step but d artagnan seized the moment at which in this movement the sword of bernajoux deviated from the line				1305.7338417535857

the coadjutor is at this moment one of the seven kings of paris and has a court				1522.3036739821632
the house to which d artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening				72.75460542524527
immediately one of the men who were waiting slipped down into the moat tied under grimaud s shoulders the end of a cord and the remaining two who held the other end drew grimaud to them				19.25073676624192

nay i know not some evidence required from us perhaps may it not be about that cursed affair asked aramis in which case i do not greatly care to go for it will be to pocket a lecture and since it is my function to give them to others i am rather averse to receiving them myself if it were so answered athos we should not be taken there by lord de winter for he would come in for his share he was one of us you re right yes let us go on arriving at the louvre lord de winter entered first indeed there was but one porter there to receive them at the gate				516.3669152259894
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort				995.7172817715056

this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject				5957.383342713857

reload the muskets grimaud said athos and we gentlemen will go on with our breakfast and resume our conversation				386.90437386029777
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to one who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of life				360.90599240275213

albert looked at his two friends not timidly but in a way that appeared to ask their opinion of what he had just done				145.4666154654582

good said mazarin i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation why do you say that asked the queen almost timidly				4936.028453016428
while waiting the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house the garden as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of servants who passed to and fro with an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent				2435.144654888149
rochefort had returned to the chevalier d humieres his fifty horsemen less two missing at roll call				11326.148803006065
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene				1744.9752634706124
if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all i wish				714.3996960247594
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed				2904.097375234373
wait how long i must calculate our chances i will give you the signal but you will not leave me you will come to me or you will let me come to you				12.47029931191076
the carriage stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques				25.408822458980847
i looked carefully around i was indeed alone no noise disturbed the silence but the owl whose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night				308.238570160124
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercÃ©dÃ¨s has declared she will kill herself if dantÃ¨s is killed caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantÃ¨s				266.1670417757197
indeed sir i thank you you have recalled one of the most agreeable recollections of my youth will you permit me then to recall another to you relating to him yes and no faith said madame de chevreuse say on				180.76880510913932
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort				44.93935101941027
the nasturtiums and other plants which his father had delighted to train before his window had all disappeared from the upper part of the house				155.30050713955967
well sir replied eugÃ©nie i have tried to the very last and now that the moment has come i feel in spite of all my efforts that it is impossible but said danglars whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of will what is your reason for this refusal eugÃ©nie				223.11411621984828
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal				11819.34535209885
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while d artagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table				99.2565337279958
just heaven what have i read cried the duke				10.990222730383598
have i discovered the truth he said but whether it be for recompense or punishment i accept my fate				1848.4616501239022
i come in the name of our master ali tepelini if you come from ali himself said selim you know what you were charged to remit to me yes said the messenger and i bring you his ring at these words he raised his hand above his head to show the token but it was too far off and there was not light enough to enable selim where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view				37118.95412028261
but who then is andrea cavalcanti asked danglars in amazement				310.50564918226206
still one place where the grass was thin attracted my attention it evidently was there i had turned up the ground				75.11822356412688
you rochefort				108.44902539420842
my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the of september that is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life the abbÃ© busoni whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him he added that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire				21845.010651492565
three of my best soldiers whom your majesty knows by name and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated and who have i dare affirm to the king his service much at heart three of my best soldiers i say athos porthos and aramis had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from gascony whom i had introduced to them the same morning				269.5531311893712
i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and sensations				4036.052481135552
all is over but said athos who is the wretch that has dared to raise his hand against his king an amateur headsman replied aramis who however does not handle the axe amiss did you not see his face asked athos				4.195835650654581
for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner morcerf dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the count				6.813786964130558
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and d artagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after him				3.4511867315193765
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme				66.81586394130822
defend yourself one minute said the young man				1.758425475984662
then they did not watch over this man				261.80470360830066
his eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon the door through which the king must enter				2796.7505191331416
milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition				2022.0197539374312
melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world i have been in ill luck for several days said danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news ah indeed said monte cristo				1.0547419790587647
this is the way in which you northerns understand chemistry madame				281.4539572599297
he turned towards the fortress and looked at both sea and land				681.4392565483001
he hastened to the side door with ali entered hurriedly and by the servants staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant				6783.001797453603
when the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed				1148.0479322712674
these horses belong to monsieur de montbazon well monsieur de montbazon is the husband of madame de montbazon and and madame de montbazon is the mistress of the duc de beaufort ah				90.20920402913752
if i should follow the two fugitives to the end of their journey said athos				5.351927924823009
the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hÃ´tel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gaÃ«ta as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended				16164.407182805824
you who are a perfect being bid spirit triumph over body				3700.3394871879677
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle				2092.6138000968963
haydÃ©e was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver her head supported by one of her exquisitely moulded arms rested on the divan immediately behind her while the other was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed water				3350.897212864994
athos did not move				839.2748315982187
a gentleman in his opinion and according to d artagnan s portrait of him the stranger must be a gentleman would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter				220.75526114383254
tell me his name and i will put it in the place of the name of charlotte backson				6636.97273007858
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule				5138.441587192841
you have already answered the question once but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second time really said albert i do not know when i invited him three months ago he was then at rome but since that time who knows where he may have gone and you think him capable of being exact demanded debray				51.604936881173096
well said he on perceiving aramis				126.04907968111814
cÃ¦sar and his father searched examined scrutinized but found nothing or at least very little not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready money but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired look well among my uncle s papers there is a will they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruitless				106905.79776973378
finish mouston finish the work cried porthos				293.0639471340489
the young man waited in comparative darkness and listened				4431.734688049552
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantÃ¨s where he was				152.94354622159486
well then it appears that we are the crÅsuses of the society				3858.613944914313
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color				8777.881644519648
his wife on the contrary whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly looking				3846.251060158404
and driving the coadjutor s carriage said the queen				9.548580254043088
i have not said good morning to you monsieur d artagnan he said nevertheless i have remarked you				116.35281489849027
chevalier take my hand it is that of a friend who will love you to his last sigh aramis stooped to kiss the king s hand but charles clasped his and pressed it to his heart				30.77790040579445
how great is the power of a woman who has made so courageous a resolution				880.9972432046245
however because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool				3803.8488638108884
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window				97.7584366996947
cavalcanti s father will be gone but the son will be here will you invite young m cavalcanti i do not know him viscount you do not know him no i never saw him until a few days since and am not responsible for him but you receive him at your house that is another thing he was recommended to me by a good abbÃ© who may be deceived				388.751458814717
i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher and what did he do the rest of his time monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory which as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholics all in the name of religion he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic sometimes a huguenot				5211.730258240141
let monsieur grimaud go in monsieur mouston i could go in as well as grimaud said mousqueton a little piqued				558.0191453188103
here is an order for two hundred pistoles call upon my treasurer and get the money				312.26900539886066
two of his comrades of the guards immediately sprang forward and two other soldiers having joined them the number was deemed sufficient				6303.163652693788
there were a thousand ingots of gold each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twenty five thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money and bearing the effigies of alexander vi				139.72780945016487
will you dine with me asked harrison of d artagnan				1.0420553695509667
it is my happiness my treasure my hope				1540.898965961322
â¢ you provide in accordance with paragraph f a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within days of receipt of the work				942.0817734693377
i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go the count rang and a footman appeared				73.83259132609015
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch				3313.323915516758
he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die said the gascon to himself				36.77617776465011
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercÃ©dÃ¨s appeared at the door				12.461082977930305
the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation				82109.99024705637
it was evident he had his orders				295.12596003636656
m de trÃ©ville contented himself with asking d artagnan if he could do anything for him but d artagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted				158.19153312210594
the young man was thrown from the top of the rock the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared the count breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of anguish				818.9164494236882
athos bowed				36.56109578311876
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle d armilly s fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantio s malediction on desdemona				17295.746863768494
athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d artagnan				1.0600433354062102
well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end				1311.6765574942012
you might have taken lord winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage				180.19753212890387
and then besides the useless blood				988.386502593021
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor and i i tell you against both				4871.492437120267
dantÃ¨s seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible				169.92268706512803
farewell monseigneur should i not receive a reply in the space of fifteen days i shall presume my letter will have miscarried				100277.77725069031
the contract shall not be signed cried morrel				22.228984324055396
that was d artagnan s road as he was going to the louvre				1347.7258518488015
contact the foundation as set forth in section below				2991.0986316780377
ah my dear fellow excuse me i am lodged like a chartreux				127115.14715601694
it is not god s will that they should be accomplished				34371.61451848622
who can tell whether dantÃ¨s be innocent or guilty				1376.3600480529587
the woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon stifled				79448.44636873232
here comes m morrel back				472.1044891749492
exactly so a carriage was waiting at the end of the via macello				6584.017235291957
but de winter did not call crushed enfeebled he remained standing and with listening ear then only when he had heard the step of the horse going away he fell back on a chair saying my god i thank thee that he knows me only chapter xli				54.350941741378975
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box				1369.6964137982982
first you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the prisoners followed your example the government would be ruined				2656.504868793347
the duke opened the purse and wanted to empty it into grimaud s hands but grimaud shook his head				7.773332733045681
alas i have them no longer how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son well let us see said mazarin isn t there still time to repair the evil				6660.369767193003
the host drew back and burst into tears				659.1200986777956
oh it s nothing nothing cried milady				37.595207893635816
but because you have paid the price of a slave do you imagine that i have ceased to be your king				971.7438262580263
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant				2791.615565436783
when one is eating ideas flow easily				3032.7303239811986
from the appearance of the stone he continued a learned gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together for ten years				966.7984628565092
that was a noble example to follow monsieur why replied danglars not entirely so with the servants you understand i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government				1372.4442387783415
who knows				20.430357234450664
if your man is mine with one blow i shall obtain two revenges that s all but where to find this man i know not have you no information as to his abiding place none				147784.59411131882
it was indeed planchet and grimaud				84.99327339690065
athos required no more				170.94668082322423
follow my advice swear and do not insult the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a moment then advancing to the president s desk what is the form said he				29.54793868836796
he was a picard whom the glorious musketeer had picked up on the bridge tournelle making rings and plashing in the water				1109.9456890086944
they both mingled as they had leave to do with the servants and peasants				24955.733046359477
never a mistake or delay a fellow who paid like a prince				223.29047262253872
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost oh yes yes lost beyond redemption				13768.84575376871
sinbad the sailor he said				3.651511604539285
come she added				256.94289819756045
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead sea i think i can assist your researches said maximilian				695.0683335272743
is it not amusing to see them both on the same table what are the two fish asked danglars				24.480571213575086
my lord added henrietta with a melancholy smile it is sad and almost shameful to be obliged to say that we have passed the winter in the louvre without money without linen almost without bread and often not rising from bed because we wanted fire horrible cried de winter the daughter of henry iv and the wife of king charles				1983.4039772791614
however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover what relics are those by which you swear asked mazarin smiling				13.625671758365273
read he said				5.119189277656368
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an auberge recommended by a sign representing st martin giving half his cloak to a poor man				141.9493189574814
but d artagnan had now slipped through the window				53.09895455975863
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and d artagnan turned to him				8.044996492564323
write my lord he said				2.7060427621611876
that is true said d artagnan let us call the others they returned around the house to fetch porthos and aramis				32.3481173925998
as to aramis he never played				48316.90440315549
now said he that suffices begone which way the way you came you wish me to get out at that window you got in very well oh you have some design against me reverend sir idiot				19836.461702285455
porthos began to hope that the thing would take place at the present sitting and in that same locality but the procurator would listen to nothing he would be taken to his room and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest upon the edge of which for still greater precaution he placed his feet				100.49781963649086
he will speak to me of god and death as he has spoken to many another dying man not understanding that this one leaves his throne to an usurper his children to the cold contempt of public charity and he raised the medallion to his lips				38.83857885253913
yes yes murmured d artagnan that s the place milady s own residence then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him as well as all who loved him and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court since she had discovered all				89.1833217333742
say no more i entreat you				9.707739651231797
taste some of this ham d artagnan it is exquisite said athos cutting a slice which he placed on the young man s plate				33305.089425065846
on cried d artagnan all goes well				123.63683027709152
around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings				27772.166384079497
a great favor				343.9053119504021
come with us to marseilles come along i will not what do you mean				26.293341168175214
but first interposed d artagnan you must present me to madame du vallon a third sigh from porthos				55.957549200085104
i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you				26.212303879669133
i am determined to tell them all about it be silent you simpleton cried danglars grasping him by the arm or i will not answer even for your own safety				2788.6380496426623
add another day for landing and that would make four				567.4443338538006
in ten minutes after the strangers had departed franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert after the manner of pliny and calpurnius touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators				4498.914974225035
d artagnan glanced at the dinner service				435.44575878950087
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening				1861.2651550686626
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison no sir not at this moment at least sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating				17760.61315865809
dantÃ¨s read it				6.799888653768802
a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict				37957.91489244006
ah that is really original said beauchamp				91.05390749621425
franz returned to the manuscript and continued sir said the president you have been invited to join this assembly you were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfolded you accepted				12517.000801419334
the notary left the room backwards and bowing down to the ground it was the first time he had ever met a similar client				34084.8835791862
here is a man who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to die like a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance				470.57639733097795
friends well then tell me at once what you want that i may see if any arrangement be possible				192.4689615817533
but to return to these registers true this story has diverted our attention from them				19.6776338019918
why really one would say that you four were anthropaphagi				77934.43985875185
d artagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak				630.3965992774545
besides which in a short time resumed d artagnan we shall have set battles cannonades conflagrations and there will be great variety well then i decide i have your word then yes tis given				14062.723929428023
milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole hÃ´tel				479.07852036524446
morcerf asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen				635.0022486319268
no said porthos i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood who have just sent me word they could not come				116.99935330095151
the queen though occupied by a thousand details tried to catch the gascon s eye but he with his wonted prudence had mingled with the crowd				133.4778678750805
the papers had related his various adventures both as the man of fashion and the galley slave and as everyone who had been personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of m benedetto for the murder of his comrade in chains				41999.837496925844
now that way of joining them is not very attractive to me i confess				18811.598300373083
difficult for kings to return to the capitals of their kingdoms				3397.8348783499305
it is even probable that i shall have to make a journey				1679.277383015877
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the jew s again what				148.9237129508297
pray relate it to me caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments then said no truly it would take up too much time well my good friend returned the abbÃ© in a tone that indicated utter indifference on his part you are at liberty either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own part i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the matter end				2031.1352942291699
besides i shall only take the time to go and return yes yes i understand said danglars and then in a low tone he added to paris no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal gave him				13.418062199067634
he kept himself upright and dreamed without sleeping				1181.902373207223
he was a man as must have been already perceived who made but little noise and yet was much sought after				1335.614034078985
do you permit me to return yes to morrow the cardinal took the queen s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips				39.47968582828833
but what ails you father				317.1109125497979
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended				4374.889208105126
that french officer yes fernand yes the traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he was pardon me my friend that man was your father albert advanced furiously towards beauchamp but the latter restrained him more by a mild look than by his extended hand				71.68227452055905
well monseigneur replied the latter three musketeers and a guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion st gervais and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy and have killed i don t know how many rochellais did you inquire the names of those three musketeers yes monseigneur what are their names messieurs athos porthos and aramis still my three brave fellows murmured the cardinal				1869.7531701099483
monsieur said athos i have engaged two of my friends as seconds but these two friends are not yet come at which i am astonished as it is not at all their custom i have no seconds on my part monsieur said d artagnan for having only arrived yesterday in paris i as yet know no one but monsieur de trÃ©ville to whom i was recommended by my father who has the honor to be in some degree one of his friends athos reflected for an instant				646.7547854763412
but now you are happy doubtless replied the count since no one hears me complain and your present happiness has it softened your heart my present happiness equals my past misery said the count				6.786489521254699
and what guarantee will you give me asked she if i consent to confide this message to you my love for you				16.21933582029794
oh yes i will listen monsieur for i am most curious to hear what explanation you will give				5025.833031406401
false he muttered				11.147859337840824
as to that cried d artagnan after a moment of reflection i shall surmount it be assured how so i will go this very evening to trÃ©ville whom i will request to ask this favor for me of his brother in law monsieur dessessart but another thing what asked d artagnan seeing that mme				22.202532859092614
yes the priest oh i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night before was it ever known who this miserable fellow was he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady				506.4156953769041
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousse s murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends				11126.694747107042
you have lived three years in paris				108.86668223605304
the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in one of the paths was the one that most impressed itself upon his mind				110.24702205385775
i told you villefort was ambitious and to attain this ambition villefort would sacrifice everything even his father then sire may i present him this instant duke				2311.7783637227813
madame he said to the duchess i have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you it has succeeded since you deign to receive me				8.024897182104846
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him				4.031188827933045
he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent but barrois who had heard all that passed had guessed his master s wishes and had already gone to fetch one				914.7586493200258
have you your sword athos cried d artagnan				1.0372556429860156
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man				305.67159035917524
m de trÃ©ville employed this powerful weapon for the king in the first place and the friends of the king and then for himself and his own friends				84.88703503389105
the brigadier had a moment s hope				869.8759377529608
england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained				5261.59066230055
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart				38.1249673694366
both orleans and montargis are ours				580.2005133155762
i congratulate you				8.421882578221735
what would you have proposed maximilian had you found me willing to accede it is not for me to say you are wrong you must advise me what to do do you seriously ask my advice valentine certainly dear maximilian for if it is good i will follow it you know my devotion to you valentine said morrel pushing aside a loose plank give me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my brain				489.25646944446515
he offered a seat in his landau to madame danglars that she might be under the care of his wife				149.43744828736806
here said he is the price of the execution that it may be plain we act as judges that is correct said the executioner and now in her turn let this woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade but my debt and he threw the money into the river				412.70112998059903
let me at least reach a shady spot said andrea				242.11291336851755
precisely madame replied monte cristo but i perceive i have not much to teach you				8.988017793213308
but we must say at the present moment d artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested				58305.27215252693
d artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for				155.84597493085064
aramis smiled as one who hopes				4580.9328531536
on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away				377.68592264504184
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps				19867.16967063768
the clock struck half past eight and still another half hour was passed in waiting while morrel walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the opening				1074.6780232536466
not a step further said the man who appeared to be the captain or i will hamstring your horses peste said porthos it would be a pity animals which cost me a hundred pistoles each i will pay you two hundred for them said mazarin				36.80040329879756
an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones				14541.6760678189
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young man and perhaps in that of the old man many repressed desires many stifled sighs which found vent when faria was left alone and when edmond returned to his cell				307.9453384371214
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you				15.462420846404573
how pale you are the abominable creature murmured d artagnan				1.0372362145818566
the greatest possible gayety prevailed at court				435.4561407491716
at two o clock i shall have the honor of expecting you at the hÃ´tel of monsieur de trÃ©ville				27.771713468460767
it is twenty years since i saw them and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them and these men were your friends one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me				26.270256970761938
how strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least we shall see				227.68927112336175
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him				4.530182450174711
you have decidedly some genius at your control ma foi spread that idea replied the count of monte cristo putting his foot on the velvet lined steps of his splendid carriage and that will be worth something to me among the ladies as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the door was closed but not so rapidly that monte cristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left madame de morcerf				78.14613420478253
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st				974.9518790206092
but here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp				355.97067924319094
but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on the base				5079.264725777563
what dost thou there rascal asked comminges				142.41481750430916
i demand the suppression of the thesis since then continued aramis i have lived very agreeably				45106.24085896928

i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me it is but christian charity replied d artagnan not to lead one s neighbors into temptation it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them d artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute italian				3984.966388958124
what is this asked mercÃ©dÃ¨s				610.5103193579956

it was past a question now that faria was not a lunatic and the way in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased edmond s admiration of him but at the same time dantÃ¨s could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there				139.43050155265047
no boat exclaimed groslow it is impossible tis true however answered the sailor there s nothing in the wake of the ship besides here s the end of the cable what s the matter cried mordaunt who coming up out of the hatchway rushed to the stern waving his torch				33026.59409351267
i remember well that the oars made no noise whatever in striking the water and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares besides the rowers the boat contained only the women my father mother selim and myself				251.76011639666558
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none				9883.21497016161

noirtier rue coq hÃ©ron no				37.68935159630934
but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you now that i see you young and with a promising future now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth edmond turned away his head with a sigh				397.49099181164013
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air Ã  l anglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures				963.0352425773186
these two men were the executioner s assistants				70692.83820214508
at last cried d artagnan				1.0335227250384011
aramis here cried athos				2.599056096413467
ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag				7866.686528666185
yield you yield to me do you not a giant had seized also aramis s two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp				416.6059170054254
that is to say replied milady driven into her entrenchment that i have not the honor of knowing her personally but i know a great number of her most intimate friends				173.51446492799698
chapter xxiii				34.0256573566427
this is what i shall do i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned				10880.021063819688
drive to the palace said comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive				34738.06024158955
besides i am a picard then it is understood said d artagnan you would rather be killed than desert your post yes monsieur and there is nothing i would not do to prove to monsieur that i am attached to him good said d artagnan to himself				34.9644648704102
doubt if you please but i am sure of what i say				56.06526382107559
ah said he raising himself on his elbow is it you comte de la fere yes sire replied athos				4.047616348370966
mercÃ©dÃ¨s raised her head and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her				14.69571257895243
oubliettes are employed as a means of kingly vengeance and a low born fellow such as he is would not have recourse to them				24.709237514782398
if anyone seeks a quarrel with you shun it were it with a child of ten years old				335.55804261211364
begone then d artagnan saluted m de trÃ©ville who held out his hand to him d artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude				2476.87404588478
yes what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer				241.59452840682115
five answered groslow one every two hours d artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive				28567.065166082917
do as you like she said i rely upon you will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name throughout this business command sir what do the people want this time demanded the king				18.661385668347076
these bitter sweet pleasantries lasted ten minutes sometimes longer but always finished thus monsieur de chavigny turning toward the door used to call out halloo				7224.511026979543
i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of money today and monte cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand while with the other he held out the receipt to danglars				233.85592914790968
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you				337.4464534490555
in the first place you will sup with me will you not asked aramis				17.274896351727218
haydÃ©e s nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers nay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence				677.6871953701209

you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here				134.85640793952592
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words				559.7527106715883
he kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road				481.6629825858719
that falls out oddly				7661.82868668968
you mean to say we have lost said athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table				85.16845337351089
meantime between charenton and the royal army was left a space which looked ready to serve as a last resting place for the dead				647.1172531481202
one night more and he would be on his way				297.0311946659694

no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued				41687.38142348354
many said your father had only to show himself to crush the charge against him many others said he would not appear while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels and others went to the police office to inquire if he had taken out a passport				13824.264733938586
but as we have said d artagnan paid no attention to this persistence of poor kitty				19320.007276077416
why did we not destroy the child with the mother what need you fear said athos recovering from the instinctive fear he had at first experienced by the aid of reason are we not men accustomed to defend ourselves				3549.237489211345
it appears that the method i have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best				4052.6259113937754
and from this time the kindness which edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman				63950.13007030073
why did you talk of a regiment athos				899.9159831042579

you will assist me in the work will you not most undoubtedly				36909.55777638341
yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain				3925.8313022448183
does your excellency wish for a receipt said the major at the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat				349.4013281892139
and now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy haydÃ©e s apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son haydÃ©e said morrel what has become of her she departed last night to leave you to wait for me				20.541522004965117

perhaps we shall soon meet on the field of battle but in the meantime we shall part good friends i hope yes my lord but with the hope of soon becoming enemies be satisfied i promise you that i depend upon your word my lord d artagnan bowed to the duke and made his way as quickly as possible to the riverside				44910.2537940677
you will see in me an ambassador worthy of the high interests he is authorized to discuss with his sovereign where is the treaty here it is anne of austria cast her eyes upon the treaty that d artagnan presented to her				33.57922031190078

it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count				29.610626119435654

but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him				19.045743230094214

d artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge examining his papers but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote or rather corrected lines of unequal length scanning the words on his fingers				2825.492135580535
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair				593.4539528302826

the town is in open revolt and just now as i was crossing the rue montorgueil with monsieur du vallon who is here and is your humble servant they wanted in spite of my uniform or perhaps because of my uniform to make us cry long live broussel and must i tell you my lord what they wished us to cry as well speak speak down with mazarin i faith the treasonable word is out mazarin smiled but became very pale				181.5299736226477
this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his security				2431.6161035782716
suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment				6759.2577686951445
as to what is said everybody is discontented everybody complains but everybody means nobody explain yourself my good friend said the coadjutor				180.7972524507599
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection				3514.7020833912948
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the chÃ¢teau d if were interred in an ordinary burial ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman				21.23942930888668
he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt appeared				297.90779309174866
in the court are orange trees in pots turf and clumps of flowers and no steel traps no the stables are on either side of the gate which you see there and andrea continued his plan				2107.3907957748515
it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the glass and which valentine had drunk it was indeed the poison which could not deceive m d avrigny which he now examined so closely it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some proof remaining to reveal the crime				1693.9078439570005
but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury the nubian smiled				687.5958360051103
and king charles is well as i have just heard he is dead my lord said aramis				17.789140727064794
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating				15382.114130900636
in what a tone you speak cried valentine				185.83252896744077
i must seem to you by no means curious but i assure you that it is not my fault i have delayed it so long it will happen one day or the other and do you propose to make this journey very shortly i do not know it depends on circumstances which depend on certain arrangements i should like to be there at the time you come and i will endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my power for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at monte cristo i should avail myself of your offer with pleasure replied the host but unfortunately if i go there it will be in all probability incognito the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz for the unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his guest did ample justice				461.2185608004873
but d artagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts				17337.809444136976
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form				314.2068410227429
i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of paper than of a sword or pistol the fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be said danglars				29.708147002890012
the cardinal trusted him and therein found his advantage				2163.448203182902
you must be satan cried she				24.79869698820492
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i will tolerate him or he must never set his foot again in my house do you understand madame oh this is too much cried hermine choking you are worse than despicable but continued danglars i find you did not even pause there insults you are right let us leave these facts alone and reason coolly				8760.052292011384
are you on the ground asked d artagnan				1.035579204771454
nothing would be more easy said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal i have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket here it is have it examined by the governor of the port said the shipmaster and give me the preference where shall i find the governor at his country house and that is situated at a quarter of a league from the city				418.5049863303725
yes shall i call him yes valentine went to the door and called barrois				1885.951393769548
take this pen and write caderousse awed by the superior power of the abbÃ© sat down and wrote sir the man whom you are receiving at your house and to whom you intend to marry your daughter is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon				12045.405725600469
i was at the end of my journey and of my credit				6334.336240258999
grief had made her blind to all but one object that was edmond				2670.657498311979
it was scarcely eleven o clock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m de trÃ©ville who could not fail to think the manner in which d artagnan had left him a little cavalier				2752.461531445318
well be on our side now resumed aramis				20.194151408659934
franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained				49495.076879623266
cardinal mazarin as king				62.243250879669326
what is the matter dear grandfather said i are you pleased he gave me a sign in the affirmative				1334.7328962269335
then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love and approached the couch on which he was reposing their feet hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare hair flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave way before looks that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss				2095.8762708893246
well albert said franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels				39446.128817572935
nevertheless d artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him				26.519281854849833
he passed on to another it also was empty but the third which he tried was from the dull sound it gave out evidently full				9658.119847630589
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening				3058.916244485335
duc d harcourt fontrailles and the others escaped de rieux was inclined to do likewise but i told him they wouldn t look for us where we were				395.5888007891576
on seeing this figure mute and immovable as a statue milady was frightened				2527.1596042078677
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with d artagnan on one side porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan				365.87431302974704
do not be alarmed maximilian it is nothing and has already passed away				142.06951372589054
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful apparition				2884.951078888522
dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying				1211.0212879340697
she asked me not to send the protestants of la rochelle the assistance i promised them i have not done so				17.506223696760962
her face was so passionless that he as every one else present was incapable of reading her thoughts				835.93743517157
you guess aright my friend this youth is an orphan deserted by his mother who left him in the house of a poor country priest				6627.308281436288
he repaired then instantly to the office of the lieutenant criminel				20326.01259891905
nothing but intrigues				523.2624729746811
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit travellers the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated albert on his success				24433.40078547054
i can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river				798.8869391645381
the valet re entered				56.84430872965768
your name the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times possibly madame				392.3037301939788
the steps were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each other s torches				15613.711818453206
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping				3707.701066812508
yes in italy it was in italy most probably replied monte cristo you have travelled then in italy mademoiselle yes madame and i were there two years ago				3056.5425571157434
in short groslow seemed to be pleased with his reception				74726.92621175
well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and i may believe it in every particular see sir replied caderousse in this corner is a crucifix in holy wood here on this shelf is my wife s testament open this book and i will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix				22677.1438156463
yes no				10.26034443024066
royalty payments must be paid within days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns				27755.3531183713
these gentlemen added he turning to the two friends will i trust do me the honor to breakfast with me but my dear count said albert we shall abuse your kindness not at all on the contrary you will give me great pleasure				1141.3739567695372
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it you know his business here then pardieu he has come to draw but i don t know how much you will know presently my friend very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day what do you mean of whom do you speak				385.31567704239995
quick to the louvre said he to the louvre without losing an instant and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by the cardinal				59.85638037252283
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements				2211.4530084728303
the young man pressed valentine s hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase				1021.1967346734486
my dear athos i have reflected on your arguments and i am convinced				391.8279385365295
monsieur de beaufort had said that he had forty ways of getting out of prison				644.3737306575512
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience				2164.845457509961
sinbad the sailor humph said the major very good				362.0580996177963
it can not be wondered at that his mind generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions love and fear was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts				1575.5301944470968
madame cried mazarin you have ruined us all the king yourself and me at this cry from the soul of the frightened cardinal anne became alarmed in her turn and would have recalled comminges				483.79977958183366
well everything was finished as you know				71.00590363522502
m de monte cristo has only shown us kindness				1663.3005980626797
soon a torrent of vivid sparks fell around them then at last the volcano was extinguished then all was dark and still the floating bark and heaving ocean				984.2111505416935
in spite of herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who was so brave and appeared to be so much in love				307.3204358794317
you who love and are beloved you who have faith and hope oh do not follow my example				794.9042781606231
the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum				73201.80939031404
you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and i think you relished them tolerably while speaking caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions				3317.611419265128
you ll bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur groslow by this arrangement d artagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis				469.2340052933427
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister				308.9447329416252
while monsieur d arminges gave orders for the horses to be made ready for departure the two young men ascended to the upper windows of the house and saw in the direction of marsin and of lens a large body of infantry and cavalry				12628.401598889039
it was like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart and then thrilled through his whole body				287.0709738246561
the count s tutor was well acquainted with the country he consequently proposed to take a crossroad which lay between that of lens and that of bethune				4150.884080610939
in the rue meslay				199.01937762359728
what is it listen said the guide i said to myself something is always left in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years so i began to sound the wall ah cried monte cristo remembering the abbÃ© s two hiding places				152806.66121211438
second porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his thigh as the englishman without making any further resistance then surrendered his sword porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to his carriage				119.42785432602578
did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so monsieur de beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun				461.215041995545
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of us i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter				8.223207145259046
so you see my dear friend that if you are not in a hurry i am very much in a hurry aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion and took leave of him				7.926092384089871
no this is his blood where were you then where you left me under the scaffold did you see it all no but i heard all				52.438346060532844
oh m d avrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m noirtier just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking and the same love for you eh my dear child yes said valentine he was very fond of me who does not love you valentine smiled sadly				493.2412011750655
you are free to night without fighting so much the better				123.77480209509274
it is unnecessary to say that from the day i saw raoul i loved him nevertheless believe that i heartily pray that i may not become to him a father however much i might be proud of such a son				413.0720512511624
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground				47.11978991871748
come monsieur bazin make yourself easy said d artagnan people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven monsieur was already such a good theologian said bazin almost weeping he might have become a bishop and perhaps a cardinal well but my poor bazin reflect a little				373.85933738192784
your excellency has not stated the number of guests ah true how many covers count for yourself is everyone here your excellency yes bertuccio glanced through the door which was ajar				19284.590089105848
well mademoiselle what are you thinking about standing there like a statue				862.7682724397044
had his and these two powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring not only from all the provinces of france but even from all foreign states the most celebrated swordsmen				8314.552385301693
where is the prisoner said a voice				145.00379443327012
it was in the rue des france bourgeois close to la force				2469.8142676377315
ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore you d artagnan felt himself bewildered				5079.976838446314
hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you desire that is to say replied d artagnan that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it				6.7336991169122316
will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hÃ´tel of the duc de la trÃ©mouille and that they did not endeavor to burn it which would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example				3050.241118219993
felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would see				344.09230775880206
no it will all go well m d Ã©pinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m d Ã©pinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation				55245.87678902797
you owe me nothing but some trifle of francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself				47.142488535555614
lord de winter perceived nothing of this				175.05915397380386
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength				2211.621735384059
well said he on perceiving d artagnan				1.04621267403189

they proceeded to the rue saint denis				199.086293253777
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dantÃ¨s mate of the ship pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris				87.96442977258475
charming said mazarin				68.8936473307285
she will be the sooner with her mother				309.60703947646914
dantÃ¨s listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone				185.70054419577755
three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities				14686.733167029277
thence introduced into a half subterranean gallery he became on the part of those who had brought him the object of the grossest insults and the harshest treatment				24763.29713672513
they are desirous that you should drink to their health in their favorite wine				363.91252704526454

monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt				39840.37436628304
this morning you rose at five o clock you must stand in need of repose				267.7458740665923
danglars waited a moment expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage				903.8880144098914
because it could have been said that i had had him condemned for the sake of justice and had let him escape out of pity but if he had escaped impossible my precautions were taken and does your honor know the four men who undertook to rescue him the four frenchmen of whom two were sent by the queen to her husband and two by mazarin to me and do you think mazarin commissioned them to act as they have done it is possible				162.39763037005224
night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dantÃ¨s agitation				542.566631894928

forty thousand francs income i think you said porthos began to be suspicious				5634.047212051592
you appear to consider this a point of honor and it may be for this reason that you have delayed acknowledging your name				127.44305041978288
i will be an abbÃ© if it suits me				17.710807947240045
there is a popular proverb to the effect that it is only mountains that never meet and popular proverbs contain sometimes a wonderful amount of truth oh go on monsieur go on said madame de chevreuse eagerly you can t imagine how much this conversation interests me you encourage me said athos i will continue then				206.7019389795932
it concerns me much said d artagnan since you can not marry madame without my consent and since and since asked the swiss				500.63177821609446
a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd				199.98694825885917
d artagnan following the strange custom of the times considered himself at paris as on a campaign neither more nor less than if he had been in flanders spain yonder woman here				460.1088310973151
the plate was magnificent old and appertaining to the family				968.8770625992937
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force				6991.713131336047
bravo bravo morrel saw it was useless to say more and refrained				12951.778823455055

milady sprang toward him				4.276737981318643
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms				414.97460088617754
oh very shortly madame said he but i do not precisely recollect the date of the day				243.65802029707575

peppino walked with a firm step doubtless aware of what awaited him				6.702598352395881
with a full heart and burning head he desired olivain to lead on the horses to a wayside inn which he observed within gunshot range a little in advance of the place they had reached				6609.364023552237
for my part i always thought his poetry detestable and i think i know something about poetry who is this officer inquired raoul of athos who is speaking monsieur de scudery the author of clelie and of le grand cyrus which were composed partly by him and partly by his sister who is now talking to that pretty person yonder near monsieur scarron raoul turned and saw two faces just arrived				1097.7449169016404

debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive madame danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments				1927.7749152925876
he addressed himself then to porthos to gain information respecting athos and aramis and to aramis in order to learn something of porthos				169.03994692971239
it was empty as yet but a pheasant and two partridges were lying near it				7.9712318575850185
the little boat bounded over the waves like a nut shell				9334.850209829587
these horses are equipped for the field				546.8144731752494
turning to his friend dear maximilian said the count have you nothing to do in this land i have to weep over the grave of my father replied morrel in a broken voice				22.876900012791907

like all the great nobles of that period athos rode and fenced to perfection				3076.6603891818786
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances				827.2699523251033
i am lost murmured the queen lost for the cardinal knows all and it is he who urges on the king who as yet knows nothing but will soon know everything				303.82898577902426

dantÃ¨s struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand francs upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession				2378.0870102552935
this time he fell on his knees and clasping his hands convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone				408.5203669431073
oh the scoundrels				438.4115215537346
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever				346.8939281314639
the heat of the day had gradually decreased and a light breeze arose seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning siesta of the south				4023.593036158646

would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him				13.001384439896606
he then returned to the captain said a few words to him and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately				1260.5641672108452

with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city				1324.9421901073479
grimaud had indeed during twenty two years of service seen his master extricate himself from so many difficulties that nothing less than athos s imminent death was likely to make him uneasy				168.89459888554148
he had written to the duc de beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive and he would find paris tranquil				6138.799327917364

you are right sir and no one can doubt my position these were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray				374.85219128127187
and without waiting for her reply he threw himself into the arms of the helvetian who received him with great coldness				1462.474567273577
milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face framed with black hair and whiskers the only expression of which was icy impassibility				4552.498110178483
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any hope in him till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance				80847.86356675044

the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness				36545.56917120001
the count of morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement his presence therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself				49.22643277819873
the servant announced m albert de morcerf				77.52867952801475

he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la rochelle				143.79704023271876
occasionally he shuddered he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand				58.40362992358992

scarcely therefore had the reflective franz walked a hundred steps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning albert to the guides who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a matter of course with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with cÃ¦sar s podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded franz ascended a half dilapidated staircase and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the foot of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin				8627.489644445008

now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile				122.74021367590102

come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel				523.3283480224551
so strange a reception naturally gave milady ample matter for reflection so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all disposed for conversation she reclined in her corner of the carriage and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which presented themselves to her mind				222.76628249853067

adieu my kind friends				151.63607722668357

monte cristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to the nail and cast a look around				1435.9840418041726
gentlemen said athos a wager ah wooi a vager cried the swiss				552.22222049973
since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the place of the dead without giving himself time to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which faria had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber laid it on his couch tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the ice cold brow and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes which glared horribly turned the head towards the wall so that the jailer might when he brought the evening meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the bed against the wall returned to the other cell took from the hiding place the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside				6321.8198088852
this short interval was sufficient to determine d artagnan on the part he was to take				2237.831415821477
the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday				2139.4365257897944

the latter a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty two years active and lively the true soubrette of a great lady jumped from the step upon which according to the custom of the time she was seated and took her way toward the terrace upon which d artagnan had perceived lubin				38735.223127686906
to join the army under the prince count and i too exclaimed the young man in a transport of joy				154.67446895721864

the door immediately closed and d artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity				2506.161474057889

no replied athos fortunately monsieur d artagnan has only fainted ah indeed so much the better said lord de winter				7.487151080746719
his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the constant presence of bitter thoughts he had the fiery eyes that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper lip that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the minds of those to whom they are addressed				344.8363753612142
well but can t you speak come monsieur porthos rose saluted his friends and followed mousqueton				519.9381140708384

in the morning i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus				7761.790394415506
the silence became almost painful when by a violent effort tearing himself from his pleasing reverie madame said he at length i pray you to excuse my emotion which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness i meet here but contentment is so new a sight to me that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband we are very happy monsieur replied julie but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves the count s features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity				1011.3329249852258

but no his heart is beating				110733.69159592647
the review over the guards set forward alone on their march the musketeers waiting for the king which allowed porthos time to go and take a turn in his superb equipment in the rue aux ours				312.57291217608537
oh it is impossible said he i must be dreaming				18116.748711567318

it is his voice all still remained silent the eyes of all were turned in the direction where the vessel had disappeared endeavoring in vain to penetrate the darkness				468.26103946524705
there he ascertained that the bracieux estate was four leagues distant but that porthos was not at bracieux				17173.642209315287
besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too an excuse for us				70.22154001422345
these arrangements made the lackeys retired				187.86640995108388
some day the people will burn that house as they burned that of the marechal d ancre				135.42470380263654
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal				241.0150709391722
the writing of madame de chevreuse said milady to herself				579.0413558537157

i thought you might want it to show the abbÃ© busoni well when you receive the remaining you shall give me a receipt in full				51004.21246019381
there listen and at this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the room and the thunder rolling away in the distance seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode				720.9943176905782
in an instant dantÃ¨s plan was formed				6122.69158368659
you are of my opinion are you not viscount				125536.36082328578
d artagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword				121.45830525895134
monte cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit				1557.68342012865

and you are right said his host it shows you have a tendency for an oriental life				889.4774498308789
at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all albert s establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count s chasseur also				945.6661599311165
behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps				2578.3062300415945
from this moment i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next time we meet your last hour has come and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the door and left the room well well said monte cristo such an innocent looking person as you are to do those things m bertuccio and to a king s attorney at that				187.38668649588953
the first that we have not finished breakfast the second that we still have some very important things to say and the third that it yet wants ten minutes before the lapse of the hour well then said aramis we must form a plan of battle that s very simple replied athos				5.485589025765277
porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large mustache				1140.0429548799689
the gascon shook his head these tears from royalty melted his heart				33.705895987559146

certainly it is empty replied the procurator s wife in real innocence				8046.3457853017535
the man he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his father s faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the hand and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up to the very moment of death				136.4071507452476
d artagnan relates that on his first visit to m de trÃ©ville captain of the king s musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis				13.55634464474394
that one yes the third the one in the dark blue coat yes he is a colleague of the count and one of the most active opponents to the idea of providing the chamber of peers with a uniform				1041.8968026308617
indeed when placed beside m de trÃ©ville the elegant and noble courtier athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a comparison				16068.974670925167
but still we have quite lost our dear eugÃ©nie for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france still baron said monte cristo family griefs or indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure are endurable to a millionaire				89261.059007785
your majesty has none but submissive and respectful subjects				2792.6433993448945

and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the father in law i must address myself to the banker and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his turn				67.50850369138071
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the pieces they play they see persons swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly				2433.7249610911367
i humbly entreat your majesty to choose quickly for we have not an instant to lose but if i accept it is death or at least imprisonment for him who takes my place he will have had the glory of having saved his king cried winter				1741.3877463427737

while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marriage contract were being carried on at the house of m de villefort monte cristo had paid his visit to the count of morcerf who in order to lose no time in responding to m danglars wishes and at the same time to pay all due deference to his position in society donned his uniform of lieutenant general which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest horses and drove to the rue de la chaussÃ©e d antin				12.909852627444936
the king half dressed the queen and laporte remained each in the same state and almost in the same place where they were listening and waiting				812.7051741760777

at his announcement d artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow of his bones				2532.8852174381395

they were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty we will see what we can do two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned				12579.06015946926
do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust at jussac and those two equally fine thrusts at bernajoux truly without reckoning said athos that if he had not rescued me from the hands of cahusac i should not now have the honor of making my very humble reverence to your majesty why he is a very devil this bÃ©arnais				90086.65994112166

the count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some other employment				3944.1369070323317
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father s honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms				113.3053431914203
now when evening came dantÃ¨s put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it				10.572485400982698
it is he who in an encounter with your eminence s guards decided the victory in favor of the king s musketeers it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail it is he who knowing it was i who had madame bonacieux carried off has sworn my death ah ah said the cardinal i know of whom you speak i mean that miserable d artagnan he is a bold fellow said the cardinal				14.914731627802945

in fact m bonacieux having left his house at seven o clock in the evening to go to the louvre never appeared again in the rue des fossoyeurs the opinion of those who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some royal castle at the expense of his generous eminence				1933.8707860141508
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of d artagnan and porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile				81.56615382586764

franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon				367.4061509889097

besides which the musketeer after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him broached the matter first				2026.4134413453291
but a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with cardinal richelieu is no longer the same man				317.6175688399365
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit				551.1581173534337
yes said monte cristo has it not been agreed that i should take you with me and did i not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure i am ready said maximilian i came expressly to wish them farewell whither are you going count asked julie				229.8682224558918

during this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his feet were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips and lowering himself noiselessly into the sea swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound he could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake				40085.73697633054

ah said d artagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds				877.9790214085666
then dantÃ¨s rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated				22044.37024342979
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you				15.80555079714164
it is a little worse for the journey but that s no matter there are no horses albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand				101.69593612681894

so we shall get from him one uniform and a sword marvelous exclaimed porthos looking at the gascon with the most profound admiration				459.5185933161276
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect				2886.489467707806
be tranquil murmured milady i will avenge you and cruelly peste said d artagnan to himself the moment for confidences has not yet come it took some time for d artagnan to resume this little dialogue but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished				1344.422209786169
the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water				1132.027937020326

and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king on the contrary i am certain he will do so				10.709379818822137
let us see said the queen what the count says and she opened the letter and read madame being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand i have commanded my son the count de guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens and that this victory can not fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe				1821.6696592807098
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time				160.5155905337172
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely				370138.0901372527
and knowing that real name my lord replied felton will you sign it all the same doubtless said buckingham and rather twice than once i can not believe continued felton in a voice that became more sharp and rough that your grace knows that it is to milady de winter this relates i know it perfectly although i am astonished that you know it and will your grace sign that order without remorse buckingham looked at the young man haughtily				4119.15121270336

au revoir not farewell				2351.798511401425
i shall require your services to see that all be properly arranged				882.4561698697602
milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the scene				888.5156058992258
she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again				215.89261509918407
this tranquillity proved one thing that d artagnan did not yet know milady				276.1973605167265
at nine in the morning he reached nanteuil and stopped for breakfast				1389.8536535298886
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark				10349.473161015098
bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life				310.1505069197857
for two days no one knew what had become of her and everything remained in suspense but once free and placed in communication with laporte matters resumed their course and she accomplished the perilous enterprise which but for her arrest would have been executed three days earlier				4838.604713043179
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud				358.2541863071562
you who pretend to understand everything even the hidden sources of knowledge and who enact the part of a guardian angel upon earth and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered to a young girl				111.08733103108938
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle				1826.9621369550653
he promised to be here and i have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad but if he does not come said d artagnan				1.0345783225760854
have you monsieur le gascon asked mazarin supporting his elbows on his desk and his chin on his hands				45.856247801455225
at a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword and required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was the bearer				21990.868288126378
but there are some with which on the contrary i am not acquainted				5221.267025351988
the queen entered and d artagnan remained at the door				10.02257061396235

the little light in the lodge had long been extinct				14322.332477438606
the quick eye of albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily do you know the woman who has just entered that box yes what do you think of her oh she is perfectly lovely what a complexion				6014.056184626549
maximilian smiled				8.017635727844606
bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st denis or in the fair of st germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom d artagnan had often remarked this				278.0481404393762
between these large dishes were smaller ones containing various dainties				2444.7023531164473
and now now escort me where where i am going but where are you going you will see because you will leave me at the door shall i wait for you that will be useless you will return alone then perhaps yes perhaps no but will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a woman i don t know yet but i will know it how so i will wait until you come out in that case adieu why so i do not want you but you have claimed the aid of a gentleman not the watchfulness of a spy the word is rather hard how are they called who follow others in spite of them they are indiscreet the word is too mild well madame i perceive i must do as you wish why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once is there no merit in repentance and do you really repent i know nothing about it myself				349.77539559550485
pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight and follow me but i can not leave paris just now without knowing aramis stopped				636.7122977171638
what would you do i should give up broussel said porthos				12.186212330164798
d artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance				117.67624690184061
m de trÃ©ville had intimated to them his majesty s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of may and they must immediately prepare their outfits				46654.22633401473
monsieur de beaufort placed it horizontally at the height of one foot				1792.6330093962608
the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place				125.89998760004829
i received this morning five millions which i paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented to me i put this creditor off till tomorrow and i intend leaving today to escape that tomorrow which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure				1584.8198987885016
what cried porthos are we all going away then				126.10456869996342
well sir he said				3.1663863661453853

and when shall we have the honor of seeing you again your excellency asked cavalcanti				373.3119147709222
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation				97550.43910873942
did you know that i am at liberty i knew it from the fountain head from planchet				315.09566204029943
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable				24950.021785989473
valentine said he dear valentine you must not speak thus rather let me die				157.60613824311756
m noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain				15788.965265419083
i am hardly nineteen i know nothing i have no part to play				18983.29279390858
ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise d armilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine				1077.6759088480374
at a league from beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud				21046.844447901232
they believe me her accomplice and will punish me with her				43.7016227304823
it consisted as we have said of a small dressing room opening into a bedroom and when the door of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone				248.34707194119918
what is it cried many persons present				1838.35486955789
read this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe				40100.34301452793
that is my failing a capital failing i admit but with that exception i am a good drinker athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d artagnan was shaken in his conviction				5592.026287772148
tis not for me a private individual to disunite a queen from her kingdom				2719.808118802223
in the midst of these screams they saw mordaunt upon the poop with a torch in hand				94.89251836010254
does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him there will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs				158625.64827844978

stay said mazarin drawing the ring from his finger my dear d artagnan there is a diamond which belonged to you formerly it is but just it should return to you take it i pray d artagnan spared mazarin the trouble of insisting and after looking to see if the stone was the same and assuring himself of the purity of its water he took it and passed it on his finger with indescribable pleasure				2050.8897750742717
he felt himself doubly betrayed by his friend and by her whom he already loved like a mistress				482.96262515136044
summon bertuccio said the count				6.948460978413895
i will lay a wager that twas that saint christopher porthos who performed this feat				21347.316832136872
and so my friends we return to paris				312.7443625163269
d artagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous				34710.24319648826
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me				4.483773699255872
he has returned said he				11.158285666999888
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs				115.67217104481611
and what has happened to you my dear porthos continued d artagnan				1.0498976710181398
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber				53.31235767811389
in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the cross roads				75550.69781329378
charles shuddered				6.562930997926839
it is six o clock said madame de villefort evidently agitated				7786.115114967767
the person to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your father had acquired his property				69769.63054295872
the third then fell from the clouds i suppose no the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery who would not tell me in whose service he was and who said he had received orders from his master or his mistress interrupted d artagnan				1.0486588459502688
in the meanwhile he looked upon athos as an achilles porthos as an ajax and aramis as a joseph				170813.96290197776
well let my god save me or let me perish for my god				196.55390472451276
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself				39.743668003944265
you are going sir yes said cromwell				153.9187881557594
a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner				313.94221086979513
the intrepid treasure seeker walked round it and selecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in one of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass				1972.8594473408239
in another hour every light in the house was extinguished and it might have been thought that all its inmates slept				17741.754423684743
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger				1321.943992819613
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarin s niece				20115.049727050275
the young man s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie				509.0184893114577
the count s tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere				60.048173567846135
he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned				3843.640280193975
oh my god my god				29.83826914197458
why he is surrounded by sultanas like a turk				16358.957095416694
we need not say she stopped at the first floor				259.69511898455926
and now you will do me a favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me just then the count felt his arm pressed				176275.68146001053
no doubt m danglars has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs				1440.1395099332528
you are right and upon my soul i would give my life for a hair said athos				4.937762359041184
his valet looked at the visitors through a sort of wicket and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the abbÃ© was not in paris an answer which satisfied most persons because the abbÃ© was known to be a great traveller				6755.243022150773
it is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation				38393.41249754473
yes especially if you will show me the poor abbÃ© s room ah				42.53459785636389
all the same resumed he after having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows				68098.06455109228
all this was done in silence and from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken				632.0815865095659

yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbÃ© s gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbÃ© for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases you are wrong to speak thus said the abbÃ© and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error what mean you inquired caderousse with a look of surprise				305.75584869083974
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands but d artagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty s apartment				153.61904491742825
the horses started on a trot and took the road to the louvre which they entered				223.55756053169117
at the third knock however steps were heard inside				10747.769643292264
milady knew the rest				259.7342529341289
you see edmond i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my son and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son no one in truth but a mother has twofold sight				9625.83515736219
but that is not all after rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like st martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with me guess what a strasbourg pie asked beauchamp				36.12697112981613
give me a light shall i accompany you monsieur no it is unnecessary bertuccio will show me a light and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge				1495.8638379259253
come reflect and decide your goodness confounds me monseigneur replied d artagnan and i am conscious of a greatness of soul in your eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm but since monseigneur permits me to speak freely d artagnan paused				175.87115342717186
d artagnan taking with him three trusses of straw returned to the chateau where everybody freezing with cold and more than half asleep envied the king the queen and the duke of orleans on their camp beds				33556.89446933955
d artagnan returned and again attacked him				4.720028858886753
very good said groslow and opened the door of the room				264.82371261441494
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbÃ© knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward				8492.696045918783
no madame if you have forgotten the history of oedipus i at least remember it really sir you are delightful and i should like to spend a month at bragelonne are you not afraid of making people envious of me duchess replied athos				4.943319180536348
behind this group walked the surgeon and behind the surgeon the door closed				751.6197389631715
bonacieux in an undertone and now you may ruin us all my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons				24716.652053025824
they conducted me to the chatelet where i slept soundly being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free				690.8800718838904
aramis who had the third canto of his poem to finish behaved like a man in haste				2749.368452418339
alas anything you please				592.3801640098279
faith yes with a haughty presence a fine equipage such as the son of a noble house would have he will be my companion on the journey sir cried raoul				68.25605340599994
the journey at two o clock in the morning our four adventurers left paris by the barriÃ¨re st denis				210.32396342136582
the life of the four young men had become fraternal				32373.56597013691
ah danglars whispered caderousse you have deceived me the trick you spoke of last night has been played but i can not suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault				1122.408902052031
the name is wanting in this commission you can write it yourself d artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it it was a lieutenant s commission in the musketeers				412.1127504278575
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak				193.72995156244957
let her do what she likes with the duke i care no more about him than an empty bottle and athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass				309.50548522261136
he was so pale when he appeared at the door of the ball room that valentine ran to him saying oh father some misfortune has happened your grandmamma has just arrived valentine said m de villefort				5.792958086377458
crown pieces only silver pieces				5400.6495960055745
the young man knelt down				119.32738402849328
the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold				148.60846815263653
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking				34559.09726196332
he went therefore to his appointment with athos without a second determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose				67762.61667804369
during the ligue about which guitant was speaking just now the people chanted nothing except the mass so everything went to destruction				25494.28827386231
if they had discovered milady s retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to bÃ©thune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends				153.739443908849
and the crew asked morrel				49.89152128632584
this was in fact a custom familiar to him				9.110439186800429
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand				16.753969667989463
for all evils there are two remedies time and silence				763.9013834870406
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement				900.0490180844006
felton was indeed behind the door and had not lost one word of this scene				1229.2407171801422
holÃ  bazin come here this minute bazin appeared on the threshold dull and spiritless				92661.1560935527
monsieur marechal you must indeed have found yourself in wondrous peril to have undertaken so strange a commission the irony with which these words were uttered did not escape the marechal				127776.33267820654
that is all very simple you had business in england monseigneur said d artagnan quite confused i went hunting at windsor or elsewhere that concerns nobody				3731.172356493127
i know not what we shall do yet but four determined men can do much				200.636839602348
the monk exclaimed grimaud				19.817078813308814
che cosa asked the bandit				463.87010572739916
quick quick said caderousse or i shall be unable to sign it monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse who collected all his strength signed it and fell back on his bed saying you will relate all the rest reverend sir you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti				327.64873989750913
we have before stated that all the servants had fled				23245.42285982294
i suspected it				3.3039391784979792
and if i do not possess that talent which your smiles prove to me you doubt should i not still have that ardent love of independence which will be a substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self preservation				45535.68586111868
the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney				5312.814676371168
tony is your master sleeping said one of the two cavaliers to a servant who was lying in the outer compartment which served as a kind of ante room				211.57205381032801
what papers the certificate of your marriage with oliva corsinari and the register of your child s birth the register of my child s birth the register of the birth of andrea cavalcanti of your son is not his name andrea i believe so said the major				2903.5061337102125
a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence and which was given to me for you but from whom is that letter oh from some heartbroken waiting woman some desponding grisette from madame de chevreuse s chambermaid perhaps who was obliged to return to tours with her mistress and who in order to appear smart and attractive stole some perfumed paper and sealed her letter with a duchess s coronet what do you say hold				3586.5638377986143
never had he been so well received				455.5279609123785
anne questioned d artagnan by a look				412.78280642381577
officer cried grimaud				18.135416260819223
from time to time by the light of the moon which began to rise franz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various points among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a signal from peppino				396.22726699496366
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord				67556.39451343258
with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andrea s attentions in order to get rid of morcerf but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him				8.68245010168672
dost know where porthos is no not at all and aramis not in the least the devil				804.0205160889368
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine but there is one thing i wish to know and what is that inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated				11684.241829419028
if you do escape remember that the poor abbÃ© whom all the world called mad was not so				163.7397120971927
no my friend replied athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defend king charles we have but ill defended him it remains for us to save him to save the king said d artagnan looking at aramis as he had looked at athos				65.90185687983113
they passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers				5740.524505631947
i will be silent but you must endure your captivity quietly				10230.976180530903
make no allusion to the past nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your illustrious father or ill fated mother i have already told you my lord that i shall see no one it is possible haydÃ©e that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the east may not be practicable in paris				68.38385487290995
thanks to the influence of m morrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed				732.4607806392993
poor edward is as much m noirtier s grandchild as valentine and yet if she had not been going to marry m franz m noirtier would have left her all his money and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her grandfather she will still be three times richer than he the count listened and said no more				729.3679555010572
you believe and yet you leave me in the hands of mine enemies of the enemy of england of the enemy of god				1039.6684890442784
perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate d artagnan drew up his request and m de trÃ©ville on receiving it assured him that by two o clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers				35099.03904248042
doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath				149618.49456055666
my lord escape				677.8853130892393
you shall take half the sum that will be advanced upon it or i will throw it into the seine and i doubt as was the case with polycrates whether any fish will be sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us well i will take it then said d artagnan				1.025917053942564
let us drink my dear d artagnan morbleu let us drink while the wine is fresh				943.0444934134863
it was not without foundation that a report of the king s intention to leave paris by night had been circulated				25057.564714415108
the door at length was opened and a man appeared of high stature pale complexion and black hair and beard				120272.75430051489
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion				2808.587143728346
let the queen remain in perfect security let her be ignorant that we know her secret				3861.621562908049
yes my lord replied the servant m				31.83040735460654
they are soldiers though resumed de bragelonne				289.1149444850556
from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize morrel				178.11668164628537
amid the moaning of the storm she heard the grinding of the file upon the bars and by the light of every flash she perceived the shadow of felton through the panes				26294.284030459403
there are such in the world and god will doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on earth but those who mean to contend must not lose one precious moment but must return immediately the blow which fortune strikes				166753.66102364915
well well cried d artagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes porthos yes said porthos but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep i think it is the wind now climb up athos quickly said d artagnan				1.0258945225390583
she stopped on the threshold breathed a sigh and addressing the queen why then do you always weep mother when i am away from you she said				10.417732847678492
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master				648.9515167307047
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to d artagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly oh monsieur said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer				543.532760187737
ah you frighten me				4.655378572490177
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port				513.4338976748959
it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs				41362.454842257386
here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been assured				7892.325921058916
a quarter of an hour was the reply				403.68819139478717
milady however saw that this sort of narrative amused her very much and kept at it only she now let her conversation drift toward the cardinal				39.56536826754197
days and weeks passed away then months dantÃ¨s still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight				2611.2086904004036
buckingham had returned to london mme				81.62957531966391
at the palais royal the crowd which had flowed in from the adjacent street was still greater like an impetuous mob a wave of human beings came to meet the carriage and rolled tumultuously into the rue saint honore				24051.45340821501
they waited upwards of ten minutes				716.8354151239487
is that your opinion d herblay yes said aramis we have promised then continued athos we have another reason it is this listen in france at this moment everything is poor and paltry				43671.29650989444
the devil cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there porthos yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first				772.7213896163413
planchet grimaud mousqueton and bazin set off at full speed				532.352361119479
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets				144911.53153953416
we will have him informed that his sister in law is on the point of having someone assassinated and beg him not to lose sight of her				24.482246381689315
villefort quietly opened a window saying it is very warm and the heat affects m noirtier he then returned to his place but did not sit down				106.22979142585456
the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features				2832.177248633565
chapter iii				72.69898057292949
but how comes the diamond in your possession sir				408.7214476314936
the queen saving us her friends nothing more moral				39126.4678221324
anne s head was bent down she had not seen the italian s smile but finding that her question elicited no reply she looked up				154.32372190720451
when they entered d artagnan s chamber it was empty the landlord dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger had consistent with the character he had given himself judged it prudent to decamp				440305.4629590947
the two friends made the prisoners enter the house first whilst they stood at the door desiring mousqueton to take the four horses to the stable				6089.296019454674
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king				52.62133535421013
and i idem said aramis				14.695705571492276
i am rich for you have one of the first fortunes in france				133.7220507008347
you see it is not my fault and maximilian was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two girls one fair with soft languishing eyes a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the other a brunette with a fierce and haughty expression and as straight as a poplar				28974.373933626593
an hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire				948.0699546152696
i shall gain it for the hope of the nation and the spirit of the lord are with me				77.54221119998283
ah i always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter and she greedily read the following few lines my dear child hold yourself ready				2181.0007294254165
he lives at the bedford tavern greenhall street				3068.432368441601
he wished to subdue this woman in his own name and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain sweetness in it he could not make up his mind to renounce it				5.72271473821817
serpent muttered d artagnan i would give my chance of a captaincy in the mousquetaires for that to be my name aramis opened the paper and in a voice trembling with hate and vengeance read d artagnan the gascon uttered a cry of joy and turning to mordaunt i hope sir said he you have no objection to make none whatever replied the other drawing his sword and resting the point on his boot				14611.711278863026
yes we did some fine things in our time and we gave that poor cardinal a few threads to unravel and he heaved a sigh				561.4520374553081
he s a gascon				1056.4261787500545
he spoke of me to lord de winter already prejudiced against me and told him that his sister in law was a prostitute a branded woman				389.2480142161617
what must i answer the truth then i shall say the duel did not take place you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo				1.0600388059482684
now as these street arabs of rome more fortunate than those of paris understand every language more especially the french they heard the traveller order an apartment a dinner and finally inquire the way to the house of thomson french				1371.0281237000704
what object think you have this expedition to rÃ© and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting				11603.103246288836
my friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his will for he was master				7439.957381182891
he went direct to the bedford tavern and the host who recognized him was delighted to see him again with such a numerous and promising company				1373.855265473328
she should certainly return from her exile she did not doubt that a single instant but how long might this exile last				832.7189242560095
there he had a chair made on his own plan and one day visiting anne of austria in this chair she asked him charmed as she was with his wit if he did not wish for a title				10880.851175217564
ten men for monsieur de comminges as the carriage started off the cries were redoubled and more than ten thousand people thronged the quai and overflowed the pont neuf and adjacent streets				12153.351105144375
no said monte cristo i told you i did not wish to be behind my time i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscount s door the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false besides why should he tell a falsehood				1685.200482269456
we who have faced fifty foes on the high road can well meet two in the place royale yes yes but they took part with the princes without apprising us of it				26.196909633283795
but you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business i intended this money for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds				11283.326571330143
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way				596.7214401699084
if it is i whom your majesty interrogates replied the coadjutor in the same calm manner i reply that i hold monsieur le marechal s opinion in every respect the color mounted to the queen s face her fine blue eyes seemed to start out of her head and her carmine lips compared by all the poets of the day to a pomegranate in flower were trembling with anger				601.9877422767905
the cardinal s hair stood on end				253.47675470977657
but asked madame danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent m de villefort in this simple way madame replied monte cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence i therefore sent them to the king s attorney				1637.122364713045
athos said she wait a moment and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment				293.89618284080615
d artagnan retired to bed not to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening				323.38510213199294
i went to him and told him all he knew me that man did and did not doubt an instant				4110.643394313473
rochefort bent low				54.04048336149935
after giving me the plan of this house doubtless hoping i should kill the count and he thus become his heir or that the count would kill me and i should be out of his way he waylaid me and has murdered me i have also sent for the procureur he will not come in time i feel my life fast ebbing wait a moment said monte cristo				1.041908381786353
aramis then reperused the letter and perceived a postscript ps				18453.08054579959
the knife fell to the ground				37.179958389482124
i came to pray over the body of your daughter and now why are you here i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you as i do good heavens exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbÃ© busoni no the abbÃ© threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face				275.5073196320294
behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and pistols and dressed in the costume which the greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation				30479.861693271723
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbÃ© busoni it was your excellency the benevolent abbÃ© took an evident interest in all that concerned me				26.893334339678315
a telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error the funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen				503.1359848930106
m de villefort heard of him at marseilles and m danglars recollects having seen him				5.401835101640187
ten minutes elapsed during which d artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second				1254.5407172504815

the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the custom house officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at beaucaire				8102.2957402027905

it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion				848.1971024550033

it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready				984.5434770166158
go and bring me back the cardinal as soon as possible madame faltered d artagnan tis twenty years ago i have a good memory since i had the honor behind a piece of tapestry in the hotel de ville of kissing one of those lovely hands there is the other replied the queen and that the left hand should not be less liberal than the right she drew from her finger a diamond similar to the one formerly given to him take and keep this ring in remembrance of me				230.34508018902284

they might be said to be a procession of ghosts for they were all wrapped in white cloaks				11213.588195461316
the other was in a feminine hand long and crossed				756.6667555698588

but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which means too the amusements of the day are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator without reckoning the wholly unexpected one i am preparing to surprise them with my good friend said the man in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act perhaps i am but one thing i have resolved on and that is to stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty who has got into this scrape solely from having served me				65.6183912078857
from m beauchamp replied florentin				328.7238349685354

grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper				1277.9021695984861
now said d artagnan i ve one last favor to ask of you monsieur de comminges at your service sir you will see the count again to morrow morning will you remember us to him and ask him to solicit for me the same favor that he will have obtained you want the cardinal to come here no i know my place and am not so presumptuous				109779.36686236004
at malta i loved a young girl was on the point of marrying her when war came and carried me away				184.58914100497964
the gate is shut said aramis but if these gentlemen like a cool retreat under the trees and perfect seclusion i will get the key from the hotel de rohan and we shall be well suited d artagnan darted a look into the obscurity of the place				472.30353451848737
perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them				16.767152567530577
keep near me said the latter				172.46793484368453
well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said				266.61658496753114
suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name				141.1482144939755
as to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men the soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it				5.848208962892538
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years				846.1845146105585

as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port				572.0328581344853
it was fourteen years day for day since dantÃ¨s arrest				15827.710581090003
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms				6370.102272870515
his guards taking him by the arms and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind				846.0069966571086
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne				9983.725778592372
i don t know what it was				333.8310710982181
the matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for kitty				5107.345018369424
we must extricate ourselves from this position but how listen				99.22463897042762
felton did not enter				1610.7738359633097
having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the count making a signal to ali to follow him went out by the side gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight found himself opposite his house in the champs Ã©lysÃ©es				100.77600252550644
go said the duke				10.13884235095692
you know anne of austria the captivity of mazarin alone guarantees my life if you let him go i am a dead man i needed nothing less than that consideration my dear d artagnan to persuade myself to adopt the role of jailer				13832.203688069114
the game at tennis which upon a sign from grimaud monsieur de beaufort had consented to play began in the afternoon				9068.361903384237
for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you today a face which the happiness of revenge makes young again a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your marriage with mercÃ©dÃ¨s my betrothed the general with his head thrown back hands extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the wall to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the door through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing cry edmond dantÃ¨s then with sighs which were unlike any human sound he dragged himself to the door reeled across the courtyard and falling into the arms of his valet he said in a voice scarcely intelligible home home the fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his house all his wretchedness revived				20151.41555294434
what horses asked athos				3.877856471164338
nine tenths of the english people are horrified at what you say this voice was that of athos who standing up with outstretched hand and quite out of his mind thus assailed the public accuser				19864.365740721718
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half scared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person				1106.1626250925076
stay said d artagnan and do not come till you hear me drum my fingers on the door when mordaunt arrived opposite the house he saw d artagnan on the threshold and the soldiers lying on the grass here and there with their arms				226.0223284576462
now the queen is of a sensitive nature				2221.565543934253
so the duke had more than enough to think about accordingly he fared at chess as he had fared at tennis he made blunder upon blunder and the officer with whom he played found him easy game				2949.633338565174
from chÃ¢lons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat				60583.327884287544
then our gascon extending his arms drew to him the heads of his three friends till they almost touched one another				209.49040213399826
madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself				711.6674521101193
but to her great surprise d artagnan remained perfectly calm and instead of being angry he laughed and said to porthos yes i understand the air of la rue tiquetonne is not like that of pierrefonds but console yourself i will soon conduct you to one much better when will you do that immediately i hope ah				87.68217624362252
she must live that my infamy may diminish hers and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage				75.56495796212008
say rather crime replied the doctor				252.238363406792
if the thing were to do again i would again do it villefort looked at monte cristo with extreme amazement				955.5121381382347
the boy found him sitting where d artagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary				1770.6257717133008
ah it is you peppino said the count				7.140129443528145
hardly compensated for the loss of that which he had experienced in going from time to time to visit his family				791.9419293725384
we must seize the felucca said aramis				15.409789581050738
villefort rose and ran towards his mother in law for it was she				18541.034260591157
friend d artagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future				458.28750134192217
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way				885.5831014513004
their return was quite an event but as they entered together all uneasiness on albert s account ceased instantly				1654.004300106539
you see therefore continued the cardinal perceiving d artagnan s composure that as i have told you the welfare of the state is placed in your hands yes my lord and i feel the whole responsibility of such a charge you accept however i always accept do you think the thing possible everything is possible shall you be attacked on the road probably and what will you do in that case i shall pass through those who attack me and suppose you can not pass through them so much the worse for them i shall pass over them and you will place the king and queen in safety also at saint germain yes on your life on my life you are a hero my friend said mazarin gazing at the musketeer with admiration				406.7424326289367
my brother said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the world these words carried a ray of hope into fernand s heart				44.275237108659915
a moment afterwards he thought he heard his own name pronounced distinctly				7347.257866717527
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do				368.0259801591485
pray go valentine said m de villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfather s is valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m de villefort altered his intention				45794.36958007531
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features				3439.789609193456
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor				8617.268529380399
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart				30.877888940597288
the young shepherd stopped as if his feet had been rooted to the ground then he put the butt of his carbine to his shoulder took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired				3188.842668405228
just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain				576.8818072449976

bonacieux thought she recognized the sound of that voice she reopened her eyes cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so and at once perceiving it was d artagnan she uttered a cry of joy oh it is you it is you				207.1909956692078
how could i then return to brussels				11450.230202825758
in getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at court the part she plays pardieu it is not difficult to divine that after all you have told me				154.02744990593672

ah but the valise i want cried porthos is a well filled one my dear madame uttered fresh sighs				4784.806183421709
if she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies				1561.749393776661

la ramee continued my lord has done me the honor to invite me to a supper to morrow en tete a tete grimaud made a sign which meant that he didn t see what that had to do with him				11.785872173750361
fernand kneeling by her side took her hand and covered it with kisses that mercÃ©dÃ¨s did not even feel				377182.9294736076

the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected something something had occasioned the noise and something must follow				6805.135164424619
i mean to say young man that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted may consider himself in safety in comparison with you the devil said d artagnan whom the positive tone of m de trÃ©ville began to disquiet the devil				401.2669830478247
there is a servant active and vigilant not like that lazy fellow bazin who is no longer good for anything since he became connected with the church				393.9056493824677
one however fell at the duke s feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket				91.57471261756943
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide no no continued d artagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman				6981.944941239387
grimaud entered				30.331249460605743
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted				54112.469245204156

it remains here said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly				6689.792694568605

cap de diou				56.695721295598574
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt my faith yes said d artagnan				1.0275895587535202
but he bethought him of m de villefort s promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible				1703.790724557432
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards				7665.475692124044
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival				925.243683246153
but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my mother to a german concert given by the baroness of chÃ¢teau renaud this was followed by rather an awkward silence				854.7525857602839
then having renewed his injunction not to give valentine anything he went down again to noirtier shut the doors carefully and after convincing himself that no one was listening do you said he know anything of this young lady s illness yes said the old man				2.006419930770538

pardon madame he said i am not a lawyer i am a mere soldier and probably therefore i do not quite comprehend the value of certain words i ought to have said the wishes and not the will of the people				284.0200943863043
i must stay and follow the advice of my hostess while thwarting the conjugal designs of this inopportune apparition he had just completed this monologue which proves that in momentous circumstances nothing is more natural than the monologue when the servant maid watching at the door suddenly cried out ah				291.03937759200375
i thought so but we will return to my lord duke presently				376.85983261346945
the musketeers are as you know picked soldiers and they require many things useless to the guardsmen or the swiss but yet detail them to me why they may amount to said porthos who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one				171.9304368676638
and now gentlemen that s well continued the cardinal				25.349360813039187
in the meanwhile the king here detached the cross of the legion of honor which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st louis above the order of notre dame du mont carmel and st lazare and gave it to villefort in the meanwhile take this cross sire said villefort your majesty mistakes this is an officer s cross ma foi said louis xviii take it such as it is for i have not the time to procure you another				180.17089738498785
it is very evident that it is the letter w which m noirtier wants said the notary				376.4210792328052
a conjugal scene as athos had foreseen it was not long before the cardinal came down				113.64439013964258
the history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the quick indeed his griefs hopes and fears on that subject might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem				17890.695577004415
the meetings were always held from that time till midnight				1322.6545904614695
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution				3728.0494563080215
it was mordaunt with the order in his hand				24.39362023629097
your fortune is therefore made if you remain with me and i am too good a master to allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you require this manner of acting roused much respect for d artagnan s policy among the musketeers				646.4501612851122
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel morrel				133.765927283744
d artagnan picked it up and offered it to lord de winter				7.89069768123962
he rose and preceded by the host wringing his hands and followed by planchet with his musketoon ready for use he approached the scene of action				627.2470276108231
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table				65.08688540622155
grief has consumed her said villefort yes grief doctor				1722.410275445419

the englishman appeared to reflect a moment and then said from which it would appear sir that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension to tell you the truth i consider it lost well then i will buy it of you you yes i but at a tremendous discount of course no for two hundred thousand francs				136.17481653746228

the first rays of daybreak penetrated the aperture of the tent as winter re entered it				11.38482960247543

it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your excellency to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned benedetto since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead and in what light did you view the occurrence inquired monte cristo				1.037417413648906

no no cried the countess you must not leave me				5.425766872117985

madame de villefort who was alone in her drawing room when the count was announced desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count and edward who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his mother or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count but from sheer curiosity and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say oh that naughty child				252.60643761600107
i am of your opinion but find me a better one or give me the means of living athos was for a few moments thoughtful				326.0607213374501

what brings you to paris affairs of importance which you shall know later				2756.8224024838983
a gentleman of high birth possessor of an ample fortune you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier step by step this is uncommon then become general peer of france commander of the legion of honor you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow creatures this indeed is praiseworthy nay more it is sublime albert looked on and listened with astonishment he was not used to see monte cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm				475.7337462983072
all four came up together				724.9782006282907

pronounce one single word muttered d artagnan and you are a dead man the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring				145435.41901578376

woe he cried to those who confined me in that wretched prison and woe to those who forgot that i was there as he repassed the catalans the count turned around and burying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman				290.42717700846845

the catalans beyond a bare weather worn wall about a hundred paces from the spot where the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the catalans				44808.007246818546
no replied d artagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way ah you surprise me				9.60899924642815
d artagnan then repeated his name and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of the present and the past m de trÃ©ville grasped the situation				1473.0813703643084
athos sighed deeply the sigh woke the king so lightly did he sleep				597.8105097535312

on reaching the palace d artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay				4778.381027423188
she would have taken d artagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache				7650.540559474187
yes i think so at least said the young girl hesitatingly				3248.0456434439134
d artagnan swam to it and held it suspending himself by this rope his head alone out of water				983.5041567614376
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantÃ¨s took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantÃ¨s who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbÃ© who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true				347.5465951142621

gentlemen he said you will admit that when arrived at a certain degree of fortune the superfluities of life are all that can be desired and the ladies will allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of position the ideal alone can be more exalted				106476.01320918064
perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you when i am married no they told you then that m d Ã©pinay consented to our all living together yes then why are you still vexed and grieved the old man s eyes beamed with an expression of gentle affection				3188.5324895218682

oh as to that i do not engage myself				176.5518325241351
albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open boxes all these defects pressed hard on a man who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower box at the opera				482.5266442229628
then ali brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on the table				159.94584680022336
cromwell had sent him to mazarin				320.2582961796439

madame de villefort remained immersed in thought				1151.9489757611018
they breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all				112.20348193309958
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women				1801.2245519069043

the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries				37355.07250553297

villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation which he was about to begin				1228.441471730242
morrel expected villefort would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar man				153.18929594745467
when the boat was within twenty paces of the shore the man on the beach who carried a carbine presented arms after the manner of a sentinel and cried who comes there in sardinian				68388.2636498422
the cardinal s house had no secrets for me				18.414148624328817

there he is somebody has disturbed him without doubt said d artagnan				1.0494902136365438
the palace of whitehall was guarded by three regiments of cavalry and by the fierce anxiety of cromwell who came and went or sent his generals or his agents continually				33495.8895080734

i said nothing for we must have peace in the house and francs for a lady and gentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much				389.9829721180777
d artagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand				14.625672258570384
what s to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do i must then remain here here or in the neighborhood you can not take me with you no the order is imperative				284573.35507508693
for the last time where are you going to the devil answered d artagnan				1.0376198306037925
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him				6.627499627386291

large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned				17533.869449965812
the man he addressed recoiled with terror and only answered the few words of the musketeer by pointing				339766.98378321656
you understand dantÃ¨s relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience				8497.18422486388
the two sentinels at the door still had their swords unsheathed but they were leaning on them while they watched the game				19411.611733974285

open it is i but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained closed				392.37781492673656
his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal				218.35521872733287
you may behave politely to the bearer who is a count and a grandee of spain				3903.6103513555895
it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan that is true said the king but never mind trÃ©ville come still by the back staircase trÃ©ville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him				5.499690879336063
do you see the waistcoat				3871.7032823776526

oh not the least in the world madame				3136.962116703925

as for albert he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a carriage full of roman peasants that was passing near him				8.160285574739138
what sort of a man is he ask the vicomte de morcerf you hear m de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess				69.53006856502743
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart				24.766849242140772
it may be observed that there was a proper proportion in his sentiments toward the governor of the prison and the minister toward the subordinate and the master				2394.785094016215
at the extremity of the courtyard where close to a portico formed of ionic columns were the dog kennels rose an oblong building the pavilion of the orangery a half circle inclosing the court of honor				988.3445578354755
a parliamentary officer clothed in black and with a gravity that augured ill entered bowed to the king and unfolding a parchment read the sentence as is usually done to criminals before their execution				2344.1181050064324
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it				7.6821424109570815
well said beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend i am broken hearted said albert				37.295872216813294

but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle very well said d artagnan his eyes aflame battle				3253.2382323341485
it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail				11970.237988324618
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan				2975.52596666197
milady recoiled uttering a cry				738.7013295522493

their course was clearly defined they were to follow the road toward compiegne and on emerging from the forest turn to the right				2727.5837862754524

the insult chapter				1.8466896865219784
i have brought him up				236.4826093763835
the marshal bit his fingers				2793.5690398348775
i have just had the pleasure replied the count but i have not seen your father see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses indeed said monte cristo and so those gentlemen down there are men of great talent				18635.466516198627
if my brow be severe it is because many misfortunes have clouded it if my heart be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received				190.36391965909155
on your knees count athos knelt down and the king passed the ribbon down from left to right as usual raised his sword and instead of pronouncing the customary formula i make you a knight				69396.02825909194
bonacieux yes there are traitors here but by the holy name of the virgin i swear that no one is more devoted to your majesty than i am				467.49446289214967
here it is at last he said not without some trouble though yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting as he said this the man came towards edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence				3653.652487986813
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins				98933.29165421406
have you been working all night				743.6601825087506
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued				1992.7188269420096
sir said d artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman				1300.0864520112902
don t worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to smile it is nothing it is nothing i was giddy that is all another attack of giddiness said morrel clasping his hands				32.413368253226004
have you by any chance been in the bastile no madame i have not but very likely i am on the road to it ah				225.3929332731369
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot				5769.096093078059
this caused so rapid and complete a diversion from the attack that d artagnan s adversary while the latter turned round to face this shower of blows sheathed his sword with the same precision and instead of an actor which he had nearly been became a spectator of the fight a part in which he acquitted himself with his usual impassiveness muttering nevertheless a plague upon these gascons				14184.688733201454
at the sixth cabaret then as we said d artagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him				5.378821234490552
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed renÃ©e you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint mÃ©ran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past				1782.4132713549802
the young man s finger glided over the words but at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign				922.7147119159224
but hear me continued she				23.650312569722214
so much the worse for thee for harm may come of it meanwhile the cardinal was rubbing his hands in great satisfaction				363.0757022417221
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you like that is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached				229.299832724291
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them				46.35204099925534

he was thinking of mme				27.956836681554357
albert bowed with a smile to mademoiselle danglars who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness				2456.14616432829

i never had a vocation for the bands my cassock is fastened by one button only and i am always ready to become a musketeer once more				428.82257808291524
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villefort s departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind				171.59864501900407
my sword				165.31377032297613
go he added and make yourself agreeable to monsieur la ramee and tell him that you suit me in all respects grimaud had every quality that could attract a man on duty who wishes to have a deputy				15777.706248766337
why it seems to me that the way in which he left us needs no explanation				5661.732468676186
mordioux answered d artagnan i believe we must				54173.81152644843

well for my part i shall go to bed said d artagnan come porthos porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend				171.5347518963564
one might have said that twenty men or rather twenty mad devils were fighting these words redoubled the eagerness of d artagnan who urged his horse though he stood in need of no incitement and they proceeded at a rapid pace				441.10859651526124
d artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st leu and followed him instinctively				16326.99047730885
with this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet				8277.320357262339
june and july were the terrible months with athos				156.33870527821657
the jailer stared				408.87739223254295
she wept abundantly and let us speak it to the praise of m d artagnan the younger notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm as a future musketeer ought nature prevailed and he shed many tears of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half				2471.7558787327166

the whole establishment had been changed another valet was engaged for himself a new servant for noirtier two women had entered madame de villefort s service in fact everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new faces were presented to the different masters of the house thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family				733.1274805755722

mazarin was as fond of fine soldiers as in later times frederick of prussia used to be				1276.797284373056
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly only they had agreed to meet once a week about one o clock at the residence of athos seeing that he in agreement with the vow he had formed did not pass over the threshold of his door				146.96862317566698
merciful goodness whispered aramis to athos did you see what asked athos				4.3961261763697275
you think that it was a good deed to kill my brother who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist				2185.1031526965226
a man has carried off your mistress a man has seduced your wife a man has dishonored your daughter he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart				28.826709651023876
the queen is too virtuous and besides loves your majesty too well woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal but if the queen be guilty let her tremble indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it				10.325981064583152

so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hour s time he stopped before a little isolated house				581.2843762253906
it was chance that threw me in your way i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends one of your friends interrupted mme				18.518059986920704
d artagnan then looked around attentively				297768.2157810335
she cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was cruel				127561.92258211976
then you know him almost screamed the countess				73.56631584754983
and you said athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter s name				158.648628861966

on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a well stuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward				93912.34359155102

arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round				3377.236599045206
d artagnan leaning on athos made a sign to porthos and aramis to keep near them and then placed himself behind the man with the bare arms who was still laughing at his own vile pleasantry and receiving the congratulations of several others				1661.1407399857324
no one has seen d artagnan and porthos has not appeared				292.25720079104343
by its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy chair was valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and stiff				168765.968811705
the standard very well in half an hour we shall be on board and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england what do you say of that young man asked d artagnan as they hurried along				10627.884291447337
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert yes you are right watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger				563.8306780345494
as d artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been seen				934.8101638338014
at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant				2885.0033541333414
at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people				532.2955027893988
calm yourself my friend said the count with the smile which he made at will either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest feeling i am not an inspector but a traveller brought here by a curiosity he half repents of since he causes you to lose your time ah my time is not valuable replied the man with a melancholy smile				49.94636386909079

well pardieu there is yours my dear friend replied d artagnan				1.035211205883428
you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so porthos looked at d artagnan with an expression of profound admiration				648.7893882272248
in the meantime the host who entertained no doubt that it was the presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry re ascended to his wife s chamber and found d artagnan just recovering his senses				3156.125024433115
let the man go d artagnan let us save the woman monsieur monsieur cried a hostler running out and looking after the stranger monsieur here is a paper which dropped out of your hat				726.1891487483861

oh no sir it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from one dungeon to the other and which of them made this passage oh it must have been the young man certainly for he was strong and industrious while the abbÃ© was aged and weak besides his mind was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea blind fools murmured the count				6.519757357315969
if i ever find him again and i will find him i swear were it in hell he was waiting for a woman continued trÃ©ville				108.00541430673547

the baron knows as well as myself that milady de winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation the duke put his pen to the paper				541.3362824593927
beneath these lines was written in another hand see note above nothing can be done he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath morrel s petition and discovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate that is to say was in villefort s handwriting				101044.22005550188
besides each individual had one or two others for whom he was interested and as there could be no doubt but that the queen was leaving paris full of terrible projects of vengeance every one had warned parents and friends of what was about to transpire so that the news of the approaching exit ran like a train of lighted gunpowder along the streets				17652.978833489455
they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans				61786.18117237907
d artagnan alone did not seem convinced				622.2805861810932
well i have ten thousand for you you are not boasting do you wish for a proof yes there were three candles alight each of which burnt before a window one looking upon the city the other upon the palais royal and a third upon the rue saint denis				122.09693670104373
for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his eminence had rarely recourse to such means				6303.830927358228
in this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal s guards who recognized d artagnan and knowing that it was he who had wounded jussac they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning				3592.4826116875856
she becomes at once a queen and a wife and it is impossible to thank and love her sufficiently				39004.75299558405
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care				2957.1183392621856
the sailors looked at one another				262.3234202134068
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o clock				3.6326261878081656
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue				230804.01890076263
but nothing escaped the count s notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister s secretary				73516.14175435457
i want to know what crime i have committed to be tried and if i am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty are you well fed said the inspector				32.09506616456667
the lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the prisoner				106.29890638118196
you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough				285.70400884283646
unfortunately the legs began to refuse their service to this bony machine				13009.069191332748
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black				3482.6077709640613
we are compelled to admit to our readers that d artagnan thought nothing about him in any way or that if he did think of him it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was wherever it might be				98.8720207292959
valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then m de villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs				2695.0571532109097
give it to me said d artagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate				1368.0019576823754
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop				53313.4304981174
all this negotiation must be carried on openly i will follow your eminence s instructions to the letter				175.03428027765992
this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano was the bill of fare				5015.49557336865
there were also less agreeable visits for two or three times reports were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated				7387.770887092958
madame danglars had started when villefort on the count s invitation offered his arm and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own				145.0513727569293
henceforth valentine you will never again be separated on earth since he has rushed into death to find you				15.055969960121134
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside				4087.021666915473
twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a shadow through the lodge and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot				753.5381907336578
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean				15045.991970719657
but as to what had been done by porthos and d artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau				1735.7289344139342
no doubt now we shall hear that our friend is released mercÃ©dÃ¨s and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door				12.116557163664847
come but where is the doctor exclaimed villefort where is he madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase				1237.9363500099676

the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem				26034.656612085546
i heard the door open and shut and i remained overwhelmed less i confess it by my grief than by the mortification of not having avenged myself				168.37538269361548
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word				144.5652613093256
but i can not i am starving				38717.532531432764

bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe				671.999583645135
unless i die i shall always be what i am and therefore it is that i utter the things you have never heard even from the mouths of kings for kings have need and other persons have fear of you				89.46324046266133
valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event				1741.758125564932
in the midst of all the compliments that awaited her on her entrance the duchess seemed to be looking for some one at last she found out raoul and her eyes sparkled she perceived athos and became thoughtful she saw aramis in the seclusion of the window and gave a start of surprise behind her fan				1622.806700546686
franz was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host				488.40684531488415
bonacieux at home it was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king				64.69793165695697
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together				343.44170596980933
besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses				17089.89313799492
pass on your way then it is the best thing to do this raillery exasperated jussac				4256.202063941041
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries				48644.33746698187
there said the king looking at a clock there now as it is half past eight you may retire for as i told you i expect someone at nine				6593.844931428325
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried				54108.08294085865
grimaud seemed to him an antinous				38857.09740940857
you know i have made the most of my arms though i never forgot my origin a proof of great humility or great pride said monte cristo				1.0460357683298984
then we shall pay the more that s all i see plainly enough				320.39026571491064
the horses went like the wind and in a few minutes they were at the gates of london				283.78508287272905
and we too added beauchamp and chÃ¢teau renaud				12.369461536537509
and now where is he gone inquired d artagnan				1.0415092706323117
give way at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late				376.4085150334544
he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by chÃ¢teauroux clermont ferrand le puy and nÃ®mes and if i had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at nÃ®mes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings in the smuggling line said monte cristo				1.033659935031226
after a short time the count saw bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room				63.318263411944535
that great giant who was there gave it to him in that case said bazin he must be pretty sick so sick that he is dying and he wants to confess to the coadjutor who they say has power to remit great sins and does he imagine that the coadjutor will put himself out for him to be sure the coadjutor has promised who told you that monsieur maillard himself you have seen him then certainly i was there when he fell what were you doing there i was shouting down with mazarin death to the cardinal the italian to the gallows isn t that what you would have me shout be quiet you rascal said bazin looking uneasily around				1896.0015829430536
well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream the jeweller smiled				27.458504914316972
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him				7.031820627396033
of course it is of no consequence he added with a withering smile				124.5467667657246
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbÃ© as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper				13600.999471431951
with what view with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of buckingham d artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation				13487.075724090153
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary				588.1680636803575

i am your prisoner said aramis giving up his sword to porthos				74.37970487789863
but this counsel effectually decided mademoiselle danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life and acting upon this principle the banker s daughter though perfectly willing to allow mademoiselle louise d armilly that was the name of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the day took especial care not to be seen in her company				1081.2151185491134

monte cristo advanced a few steps which were heard on the gravel				1962.8117551189914
she has always believed me sire to be her enemy although your majesty can bear witness that i have always taken her part warmly even against you				20.986107557065957

for example supposing it were the daughter of a banker he might take an interest in the house of the father in law of his son then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key double locks his coffer and master andrea would be obliged to live like the sons of a parisian family by shuffling cards or rattling the dice ah that boy will find out some bavarian or peruvian princess he will want a crown an el dorado and potosÃ­ no these grand lords on the other side of the alps frequently marry into plain families like jupiter they like to cross the race				1975.5122139660832

raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old				409.942913163848

athos looked at them both and took their hands in his				192.8821226596841
sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a man and commanded other men i have seen the heavens overcast the sea rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings				11743.415430860123
i can not help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday oh there was no harm meant answered danglars at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings even so far as to become one of his rival s attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension caderousse looked full at fernand he was ghastly pale				257.41932925314586
notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated				9182.680060515877
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp				612.0087723798048
d artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon				503.94802841557316
what next de wardes can not boast of anything how is that				134.23761462533759
at the same hour as on the preceding evening d artagnan retired				217.19850202550512
well asked he what now				80.65202165760898
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it no madame no the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features				2155.4350713078197
the host was alone seated before his desk one of the drawers of which was partly open				1073.75806347583
she bore me rapidly away				149.3578750451157
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening				19472.743026328742
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity				5704.581845002317
pardon my frankness dear friend				181.02015858055427
i tell you that with that wretched sum continued andrea i could obtain a coat and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting of course of course said the prisoners anyone can see he s a gentleman well then lend him the twenty francs said the keeper leaning on the other shoulder surely you will not refuse a comrade i am no comrade of these people said the young man proudly you have no right to insult me thus the thieves looked at one another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner raised less by his own words than by the manner of the keeper				17096.658226377178
then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited				48659.788075012744
i tell you the queen does not love me i tell you she loves another i tell you she loves that infamous buckingham				681.1488260674835
then you were going to rueil yes				154.49372852117574
your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which i am deputed to see you				12.132065558283553
think not i contented myself with this one effort continued villefort				24.193166174049434
they soon arrived at the silent solitary inn				712.3794238818695
continue to be the good sweet girl you are at present and i have great hopes that heaven will reward you by giving you emmanuel for a husband julie uttered a faint cry blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster				64310.29646095937
i can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me i can believe that had you been madame de chevreuse poor buckingham might have hoped				130625.82786189967
at the sight of papers of all sorts titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i found nothing				235.77337651707336
scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight				4457.476278214534
ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal				160.40602295524408
however be that as it may the young man made a tunnel how or by what means no one knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his work				1204.7375589581384
apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among men madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful				363.03190350323524
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop				369.7231697261041
when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet				598.1415540246627
and on this assurance the four friends who had finished their modest repast separated with the promise of meeting again that evening				305.8687154280277
you are still with us i presume more than ever				119.22250704037091
there seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from hartwell and to which from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people he was particularly attached the king louis xviii was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty two years of age with gray hair aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of gryphius s rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horace a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch				6367.199083238678
age produces good sense and as i doubt not but that your master is on the road to salvation i want you to tell me where he is that he may help me to mine rather say to take him back with you into the world				105.95918676081288
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them				15.108347303737842
does your majesty wish me to drop the subject by no means my dear duke but just stretch out your hand which whichever you please there to the left here sire i tell you to the left and you are looking to the right i mean on my left yes there				191.0583225979467
madame is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the drawing room a visitor inquired valentine much agitated who is it some grand personage a prince i believe they said the count of monte cristo i will come directly cried valentine aloud				430.5617090260273
d artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry				5707.602018025596
to horse my friends to horse and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to bÃ©thune				15624.436585168693
after supper i exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding evening but this time as i yielded to fatigue or as if i had become familiarized with danger i dragged myself toward my bed let my robe fall and lay down				113.82780812933
the two brigands looked at each other for a moment the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow				170.6915703677469
the dead are everywhere said morrel did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris maximilian said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles				202.37993732750837
bonacieux made no reply but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes				52.589816940450994
he whose intellect was thus supreme raoul was the actual sovereign the other nothing but a phantom to whom he lent a soul and yet so powerful is majesty amongst us this man has not even the honor of a tomb at the feet of him in whose service his life was worn away				95.54679131106262
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law				1874.5112703155921
the first moments of her captivity were terrible a few convulsions of rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to nature				6852.00350833419
adieu madame adieu and as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort from the hand he held he sprang away running while mme				62.961401134115796
d artagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbÃ© d herblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend				175.64947852038128
this night i am determined to be free and if i defend myself or call or cry out i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman at this moment the clock struck				1309.8758555626753
now said athos sleep or try to sleep my friends and i will watch in a few moments notwithstanding their wet clothes the icy blast that blew and the previous scene of terror these hardy adventurers with their iron frames inured to every hardship threw themselves down intending to profit by the advice of athos who sat at the helm pensively wakeful guiding the little bark the way it was to go his eyes fixed on the heavens as if he sought to verify not only the road to france but the benign aspect of protecting providence				723.8931805254387
about seven o clock in the morning they set out				58.00381173914119
morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me replied dantÃ¨s				88.7302147844755
now although la ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of henry iv				33.89733543373629
a fine thing indeed grunted porthos				22.09937011641616
go away he said				2.7611744473587625
as for winter at the sound of that voice he turned pale and was as it were petrified				5867.506635375094
he had been down to the stables already taken a look at the horses and given the necessary orders for the day whilst athos and aramis were still in bed and porthos snoring				15372.552572156046
what do you think of this he asked in a low voice				21.18295118219231
m de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel				628.3600480033303
but pride restrained him and he did not utter it				12.181018547340617
he went to him				7.497731554300601
the two friends having agreed to leave blaisois and grimaud at compiegne with the horses resolved to take post horses and having snatched a hasty dinner they continued their journey to louvres				107314.38985624001
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign				990.2919151856883
we have arranged the ransom of each of them on arriving in france				114.96047516753926
all my researches have been useless				71.43427865107748
on the seventh of january between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had assembled in paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house property				8965.32820639149
there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house the only title i desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day				260.1895560457355
do you hear that madame				133.4582659747228
athos cried aramis with an emotion very rare in him				11.03837060134915
in gascony tis no dishonor sir nobody is rich and henry iv of glorious memory who was the king of the gascons as his majesty philip iv				43.863169340435796
my wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with her				66.7845526183632
have you killed the cardinal				50.818735454815446
i believed your heart noble enough to enable a friendship of twenty years to overcome an affront of a quarter of an hour				669.4307771191174
the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamore tree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain				477.01966495992014
aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a dark blue cloak of a military cut				14463.946266973671
the queen on whom he threw himself as sole support seemed to him now not much to be relied upon				592.0960684681068
what ails you baron he exclaimed				81.09701023504134
villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner				348.3293570116836
then he took the boy upon his knee				1371.5590772931778
you think then said he that i am taken to the chÃ¢teau d if to be imprisoned there it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard without any inquiry without any formality all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made and so in spite of m de villefort s promises i do not know what m de villefort promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the chÃ¢teau d if				16.807520885285435
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon				72155.84112380125
where in that box no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize i am sure of it and who afterwards sent the cup to me undoubtedly but i don t know him said the countess i have a great mind to return it do no such thing i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby				28820.211458088965
i thought there were four of you listen to me sir				66.3724131526612
all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf				75365.4665987079
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the island he examined the stones and sounded one part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed masked for precaution s sake				11926.026885876077
yes yes i see				52.194420646582444
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false he has just written to me but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence laporte detained in england as everyone else had been by the orders of charles i arrived and was the bearer of the duke s dying gift to the queen				26.16511892632894
d artagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object				13535.834508073836
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word				392.56758052681784
why did you leave the closet monsieur d artagnan asked the cardinal				17.826311753921168
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet d artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant				152.3890523540475
when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom				756.0460617402059
the abbess only crossed herself without approving or disapproving				15123.66187794311
ah ah said lord de winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy the prisoner made no reply				897.2059297836645
come finish your cup of coffee said monte cristo the history is ended chapter				1343.5218074302759
de saint mÃ©ran yes suddenly from an apoplectic stroke an apoplectic stroke repeated the doctor				302.3365192051845
d artagnan was waiting for a reply to his remark and said nothing				280.4513368589699
and at this moment perhaps felton is paying with his head for the crime of this fury a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown crimes				9499.547482700698
send the case before the judges it is their business to judge and they shall judge only replied trÃ©ville it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue can not exempt a man from infamy and persecution				48759.66244999769
there were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant women a little inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could not entirely conceal their rounded forms and peasants with blackened hands but with fine limbs savoring of the man of quality a league off				400.478103437738
but m de trÃ©ville knew nothing except that the last time he had seen the cardinal the king and the queen the cardinal looked very thoughtful the king uneasy and the redness of the queen s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful				34305.79118131861
a young and beautiful girl with hair as black as jet her eyes as velvety as the gazelle s was leaning with her back against the wainscot rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor her arms bare to the elbow brown and modelled after those of the arlesian venus moved with a kind of restless impatience and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot so as to display the pure and full shape of her well turned leg in its red cotton gray and blue clocked stocking				120159.94142132046
please sir said the boy do you think i can gain any more half pistoles in any way perhaps replied d artagnan				1.0265344379452135
she soon whispered to her husband i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother in law madame de saint mÃ©ran heard her				37.17370065480656
we have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister which belong to history the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival				11463.680358399251
but when the time came to pay for his rosemary this oil and the wine the only expense the master had incurred as he had preserved a strict abstinence while on the contrary the yellow horse by the account of the hostler at least had eaten three times as much as a horse of his size could reasonably be supposed to have done d artagnan found nothing in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it contained for as to the letter addressed to m de trÃ©ville it had disappeared				155.24919685234443
you have then decided to come to england again said lord de winter in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in paris never to set your feet on british ground milady replied to this question by another question				345.6806082369362
and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not half empty				343.1504902058232
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles				2526.610164061123
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion				1124.7780811000328
my god my god said she thou knowest in what holy cause i suffer give me then strength to suffer the door opened gently the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear the noise and in a voice broken by tears she continued god of vengeance				236.04594094708193
i respect old age but i don t much like it boiled or roasted and he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion but on the contrary he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring in anticipation that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt				2308.193024212623
very well said he				5.957796817871225
he is calling you said the count he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom death would have separated you calls you to him				38.77450737607492
then he rang				62.008925101938885
the trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped				3284.6938568031765
oh meddle in nothing which concerns me				5.4817249883436325
it was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was one of the first to arrive				5554.978739968011
chÃ¢teau renaud and albert looked at each other with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin				1369.8388018265546
he had moreover sandals bound on his feet by cords				93555.4034130527
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglars so be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned				5824.477647824588
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded				1031807.5640036814
the devil i am				350.5182137363512
some gendarme he exclaimed				69.0940668911408
send him away and all will then be well what do you wish me to do oh madame				86.64668189427131
i the offspring of a noble family who placed reliance upon your friendship i was near dying of my wounds at first and of hunger afterward in a beggarly inn at chantilly without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to you but monsieur porthos murmured the procurator s wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was wrong				1154.1300796784822
for stealing for stealing				10344.736632367023
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark				26961.150870694295
uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather				961.5026985927137
i missed her by twenty minutes at st omer				3361.6486616446737
why do you call me baron said danglars you know that i care nothing for my title				5658.213122301902
a dead horse said d artagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours i seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed porthos leaning over his horse s mane				434321.65534968895
let us talk of something else said he				8.711518788990585
porthos wept aramis pointed toward heaven athos made the sign of the cross				44237.646155372524
ali brought in the coffee				30007.715881000073
one throw is soon made and if i lose you will win but if i lose well you will surrender the harnesses have with you for one throw said d artagnan				1.0363116263799124
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere have i not obeyed				1282.8352246537286
now if your mistress is not dead if it is she we have just seen you will meet with her again some day or other				892.9417344640823
have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today a fine pleasure indeed monsieur				121.85660702618375
albert was punctual				65.4262127722663
i feel myself quite in a humor for it and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to bring a dozen more bottles of wine upon my word the drum draws near said d artagnan				1.0313225983978365
i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs				1426.7535404164948
you shall see and dame nanette sprang to the window threw it open and in such a piercing voice that it might have been heard in the square of notre dame help she screamed my master is being arrested the councillor broussel is being arrested				1031.0323577836696
there was little change in the cardinal still dressed with sedulous care his hair well arranged and curled his person perfumed he looked owing to his extreme taste in dress only half his age				1296.9348368991266
and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt				24339.954482257457
come he said if i pay you the francs will you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease certainly said peppino				229.31710888661502
yes he continued sadly shaking his head yes it is as you said misfortune indeed has overtaken us				49.143748263297645
he has grown a good deal it seems to me and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place				314.4892390881355
it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes				18792.96772857507
go and tell m albert that and he may know what to answer you oh no no said the general smiling faintly i did not come for that purpose you are right				161.46849637987637
the perspiration poured forth upon the young man s brow and he felt as if he should faint				30636.03510275215
five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort				3.742119194641818
the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin				7874.057195745935
by the bye he said i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for porthos and d artagnan the thing is done dear friend said athos i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself you are a wonderful man my dear count said aramis you think of everything well have you made up your mind to this journey quite and now that i reflect about it i am glad to leave paris at this moment and so am i replied athos my only regret is not having seen d artagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project when supper was over blaisois entered				32.76833373206182
is it you said he i am here is your jailer gone yes said dantÃ¨s he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before us i can work then said the voice				262.85369277297
one of the two riders he who had spoken second was ten paces in front of his companion				293.79445835892545

the whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world				93.84567950227559
they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word				363.28143655611996
d art exclaimed athos whilst the gascon covered his mouth with his hand				15.403192525255863

then the porter raised some difficulties but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the governor of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of the day or night the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a louis for his trouble and they went on their way				333.6339015375375
through the grating however dantÃ¨s saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saint laurent and the rue taramis to the quay				8087.674103551194
i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else tis well danglars tis well replied m morrel				75.19050556449746
so i have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone				400.15035442732653

with such a vade mecum d artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of cervantes to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait				27261.27575455124
she heard the count s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which virgil attributes to his goddesses chapter				822.6753137644648
i ridiculous				54.781897107074165
d artagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword but d artagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it				6.358351308021097
oh attend to it valentine i entreat you but no said valentine no i tell you it is all past and it was nothing				1148.387390233681

the tutor followed them				13.602295320853376
then i felt that my vessel was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest				85673.94423346866
what he continued can i have been following a false path can the end which i proposed be a mistaken end can one hour have sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded all his hopes was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking				54991.618718920836
i tell you to hope				412.8839895357215
some wine said athos on perceiving the host				160.23768575753093
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her d artagnan would have returned home since he had so promised				3138.138051656326
god has not cursed me then i cried since he permits me to save the life of a human creature in exchange for the life i have taken away and what did you do with the child asked monte cristo				1.0366404053472136
are you sure that the other is dead the other said athos in so stifled a voice that d artagnan scarcely heard him				16.042303720883005
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste				1487.7665276048976

then turning toward the second musketeer d artagnan said monsieur du verger help me to place this man in a place of safety the musketeer thinking that his lieutenant had just arrested some prince in disguise bowed and drawing his sword signified that he was ready				611.8083190187056
as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in				543.666511775963
all these rooms which communicated with one another did not inspire porthos favorably				12514.482317818556
not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor that is my opinion said aramis				18.158338333978087
no no she answered i would rather remain here are you really frightened madame said monte cristo				1.0467580571271653

i really believe you are a man and a violent one too and you you are a woman a miserable woman stupid and brutal				26787.870215510964
athos stretched out his hand toward her				8.752331364228295
it was nine o clock in the evening the sentinels had been relieved at eight and captain groslow had been on guard for an hour				6630.266839067494
let us go on				111.71446512978099

but the prince de marsillac				68.18660087186704
or the holy blood i will spit you all like ortolans unfortunately there was one circumstance which created a powerful obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat which was as we have related that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two and which he had entirely forgotten				160.16297685651716
of whom do you speak				335.523482978525
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and felt all her resolution return				1028.978390761826
this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power he hated and adored her at the same time				59.518631966254034
the four others were french and wore the uniform of musketeers their names asked the monk				170.1659373634611
wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished then only she pretended to hear the sound of felton s steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees				325.20299174250647
does the house approve that the examination should take place today yes was the unanimous answer				226.71833654580078

bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead				55.68849002370014
the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening				82.15443315596394
d artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly				465.6667675925449
the three young people separated that is to say morrel went to the boulevards chÃ¢teau renaud to the pont de la rÃ©volution and debray to the quai				3705.3398115771743
but what the devil are you about aramis continued athos				5.630797587849209

i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden				353.8268936919197
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head				18.438324164378475
no doubt she fancied the count would speak to her while on his side the count thought she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow monte cristo directed his steps to albert who received him cordially				54792.06478072654
as for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when i have completed my affairs in paris i shall go and die in the east and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan ma foi said franz it would be the easiest thing in the world for i feel eagle s wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four and twenty hours ah yes the hashish is beginning its work				2185.40429363671
three days passed seventy two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes				867.4991305585415
he almost believed in the tenderness of milady he almost believed in the crime of de wardes				41.146417339483556
at this moment the door opened and the young henrietta appeared then the queen with that wonderful strength which is the privilege of parents repressed her tears and motioned to de winter to change the subject				338.0318576176611
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation				947.7779591512763
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind				233.24853723645535
what possessions what reputation what pull as beauchamp says have i				138.9345385172458
oh and do you know who is his lieutenant his lieutenant				1422.3077275084815
behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in length				110566.33044706969
at length he one day received a letter stating that the abductors of his son now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large sum of money by way of ransom				1549.774588861145
aramis whistled for bazin but bazin was asleep in the ante chamber and aramis was obliged to shake him by the ear to awake him				3.1801596511597086
villefort perceiving the abbÃ© passed his hand across his brow				127.2771967056525
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out				90.23170373213236
cromwell had two or three of these retreats in london unknown except to the most intimate of his friends				92.02632702265421
he had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him				3.8997350990573163
the door is opened to all who knock				332813.56699057017
come in here monsieur chevalier said she here we shall be alone and can talk and whose room is this my dear child it is mine monsieur chevalier it communicates with my mistress s by that door				978.3057961308266
father he exclaimed turning pale as death what are you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat oh this is what i feared said morrel				18.005593486571065
to day look around you and it may astonish you that in order to accomplish a plan which is dearer to me than life i have only lord de winter the friend of twenty years and you gentlemen whom i see for the first time and whom i know but as my countrymen it is enough said athos bowing low if the lives of three men can purchase yours madame i thank you gentlemen				478.01789568930064
they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly				7606.61315717205
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the count seemed to have the power of fascination				51238.51961109657
these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed d artagnan to porthos and went on his way				357.0287105505989
noirtier continued to look at the same object but suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband and villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing expression				269.9741479841243
it was that of a man from five to eight and thirty in the uniform of a general officer wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of honor around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the right breast the star of a grand officer of the order of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii which proved that the person represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same thing as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two countries				76699.62159976996
the doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had succumbed and declared that he was dead				38.204375769167896
he is really dead				22.370257714799983
there you must rest young people are such braggarts it was easy to see that olivain had not been taught in the school of the planchets and the grimauds				18143.20254781
i may sleep perhaps at an inn pierre obeyed				46.10487943183927
look my lord cardinal said aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love				338.4794452487758
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment				238.1196015823713
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger				197.17985231441685
heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured				69901.232612776
mazarin himself who was well accustomed to the domestic outbreaks of this disturbed household was alarmed				677.1287054371522
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent oh i take everything on myself				243.89934019132266
moreover do not alarm yourself morrel this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone				703.7412806167431
for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal chapter x				363.39578376639713
i shall get them all in time oh as for that said danglars angry at this prolongation of the jest as for that you won t get them at all				50.965236379315634
the first day he broke all the doors in with a single push of his shoulder and i expected to see him leave rueil in the same way as samson left gaza				132032.8212705709
his countenance usually so pale was purple with heat and passion				2733.7569691191516
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it				5.532196856006555
yes that is a great word sir				190.60989060799093
are we to pass the night in the king s room asked d artagnan				1.0361267335543862
bonacieux d artagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left half fainting upon an armchair				1488.8601492171108
he went toward the place where he had left him				7.460049245993166
but this is infamous cried he				12.965832260386245
under any circumstances he resumed you are welcome my dear friend you will help me to recover my spirits to morrow we will hunt the hare on my plain which is a superb tract of land or pursue the deer in my woods which are magnificent				6693.825996282814
and he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went				663.383065992226
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time thank you sir it will be well employed i hope cromwell turned as he was going				310.83303564886074
i confess observed monte cristo that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful oh said morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side whence can it arise then				251.65029590679393
so that you have lived for three months on sixty francs muttered edmond				395.66444922863417
azure seven merlets or placed bender said he				1794.7404596933748
they had found the door of the grotto opened and gone forth on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars				21999.84619031724
you have an excellent memory milady but resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment if in spite of all these reasons the duke does not give way and continues to menace france the duke is in love to madness or rather to folly replied richelieu with great bitterness				9697.99215329583
the pope is the successor of st peter and represents the three divine powers the rest ordines inferiores of the ecclesiastical hierarchy bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels				50421.198040223535
here i shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability will be the hour of my death				428.6436966810106
eugÃ©nie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d armilly her singing teacher				23130.718463328027
de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars villefort complied and they passed on to the dining room				47.39308824134084
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables that is to say athos porthos and aramis				17.07267299104486
placed by popular confidence at the head of that movement i can appreciate better than any other its significance and its probable results				1275.0462895350352
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter				809.1338353126176
really porthos you are a gifted individual i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera				1274.284706291964
but after all said lord de winter when the three friends had been named we do not know who you are				49.52300009698874
humph murmured athos it is certainly she and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady				209.80670152105233
athos was right				112.41759010790989
for in truth i think i have hitherto been deceived in you				25.95068919415653
the wise man my child has said it is good to think of death well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die i shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room				51.53620570411617

yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded				546.2822982468489
i embrace you with all my heart				32.00349475825947
but the glass cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies				17868.35844804095

it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act				2932.6553633682265
i warn you that i will never again work in the dark and that i will know not only to what i expose myself but for whom i expose myself an illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits you				11.0210567347628

franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime				13630.449364373286
athos and d artagnan with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the musketeer				1375.5386061611107
why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today because i am he who saved your father s life when he wished to destroy himself as you do today because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the pharaon to old morrel because i am the edmond dantÃ¨s who nursed you a child on my knees morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo				1.068225618455054
but what s that to us				67.70747649529305
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction				14088.65836584845
i should think so but not without difficulty				1248.8008867525218
do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it i shall never forget it replied d artagnan				1.0333162532306797
however difficult it might be or rather as he pretended it was to astonish our young traveler this pastime really astonished him				10.240246125168749
the great man has called me his friend yes my friend yes said the cardinal with that paternal tone which he sometimes knew how to assume but which deceived none who knew him and as you have been unjustly suspected well you must be indemnified				17850.883348878026
but i am grateful i swear to you but what does this note contain milady will tell you ah you do not love me cried kitty and i am very wretched to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women				1498.1638035849253
with the aid of his pickaxe dantÃ¨s after the manner of a labor saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre				53770.121037560755
peppino put out the torch peppino obeyed and franz and the count were in utter darkness except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since peppino had put out his torch was visible along the wall				92.40739151643531
that will do said milady go into your own room and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you for monsieur de wardes said kitty				679.2708446693437

where are you taking me he asked				10.344942817791729
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and d artagnan more than anyone				546.4261063818511
in the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche				22.348060103455957
morrel called her and she ran to the gate				643.6496155885255
he found trÃ©ville in a joyful mood				986.2872110843161
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect				743.0133102379186
she stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of maximilian				1073.7462873623035
thank you no sir neither of those something connected with this story really				2093.6168656206473
good morning my dear host cried d artagnan				1.0387837895117078
the young man appeared on the threshold of the minister s closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter				275.2263266709041
and pray upon what shall i make my campaign upon grimaud i have brought you another said d artagnan				1.0344084514473488
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host				419.33617451477033
then morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not illuminated				18328.13567938338
immediately replied d artagnan we have not a minute to lose hello grimaud				401.88778383758256
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbÃ© busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library				13361.880203179278
diable when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father				244.81634284820151
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to paris is he he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling i understand well i am come to ask a favor of you of me yes of you and pray what may it be well to take his part ah my dear sir				57.71082229743224
it is well known how violent the king s prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men				296.74593617574084
d artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed quietly				1587.909945985352
felton arose				72.57522592513595
the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia				3070.7860039098678
yes and that s all settled exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail				58495.414398598165
it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it				9.98721972091296
he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german				16388.547942984234
and who is the assassin they asked together				637.3188918250927
old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m noirtier which she can not be when she becomes the baroness d Ã©pinay				117.5058447918394
at daybreak i left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion asleep				285.94388182975706
he he murmured she can it be he and she remained in bed with her eyes fixed				21429.151138917663
you are free you leave the count s house and you take your mother to your home but reflect albert you owe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her				34.22930020286251
she appeared to be in ecstasy and did not pay the least attention to what was going on around her				14.687607181703976
i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is planchet hesitated				1120.6109801015111
yes where at the louvre are you sure of it perfectly sure who told you of it madame de lannoy who is devoted to your eminence as you know why did she not let me know sooner whether by chance or mistrust the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all day well we are beaten				10938.563735995998
i am sorry if you die that you should die with sentiments of hatred toward me rochefort extended his hand to d artagnan who took it				6.4890614324110985
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count				11887.226734235495
i am inclined to think so and do you like him why he pleases me in spite of franz d Ã©pinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the other world the countess shuddered				447.20126345803027
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar				40727.63649721631
ah she cried what a frightful dream villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream				251.21149278725935
in that case replied the abbÃ© he should be a man blessed of god rich happy caderousse smiled bitterly				10.333226532038216
my daughter is only seventeen years old and your son twenty one				276.5273371895262

the decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the floor				168.1393420637823
porthos was cursing the infamous parliamentarians d artagnan ate in silence revolving in his mind the most audacious plans				14733.954326518511
oh miserable creature that i am cried she clasping her hands and raising her eyes to heaven				57.61667526756895
ah if i knew				407.3818056189363

everything had turned out so differently from what he expected that he was stupefied with wonder				5895.259539807682
i should affirm the culpability and i deny it said trÃ©ville				507.39123828494405
carmela looked all around her but not one of the guests had a costume similar to her own or those of her companions				480.78481860133445

the side windows were hung with yellow damask and the centre one with white damask and a red cross				8034.383879988803
the same deadly silence succeeded these words				720.3578869241231
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there				187.15290646301014
yes i am vice president father your coolness makes me shudder why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a hay cart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierre s bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things				387.23936884523647
morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding				60174.26898588217
send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after i have received them i shall be in paris on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him				9.241849317452969
upon my word you did well to come back nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start it s the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning he sighed heavily				4343.464803683546

the will was made the day before yesterday i believe you see there has been no time lost oh mercy m d avrigny no mercy sir				72.20164389952463
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look				420.6565526965284
to this preoccupation of his vanity d artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish				39825.93898022597
my patron died				36.23057424055089
well i hope you will make a handsome wedding present the day you marry mademoiselle danglars i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head what fortune has she but i tell you a million andrea shrugged his shoulders				52.222228214660646
i felt pain i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed				1200.9268621071076
andrea cavalcanti or rather m benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family				730.3514718311588

at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a child s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother s voice when she enjoined me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given				565.999663098793
at length they arrived at the famous room				45.94158249279355
not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted everything depends on you explain yourself pray monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba				203977.74667420678
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady so rocked by them she soon fell asleep				898.4958812573792
you shall be my body guard				669.634144435476
i am so little mistaken that in ten minutes you shall be arrested and in an hour i shall set off at the head of my army to release my minister i am sure your majesty will not commit such an act of imprudence first because it would be useless and would produce the most disastrous results				2800.043767954964
speak tis this when we escape together that i shall go everywhere and be always first for if my lord should be overtaken and caught there s every chance of his being brought back to prison whereas if i am caught the least that can befall me is to be hung true on my honor as a gentleman it shall be as thou dost suggest now resumed grimaud i ve only one thing more to ask that your highness will continue to detest me i ll try said the duke				8.957729615417625
morrel i thank you in the name of my father and of mercÃ©dÃ¨s that s all right edmond				502.8625573327057

he found buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber writing orders with his own hand				27.543079718743932
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now noirtier s expression could not be understood				1925.0100034944148
my mass lord de winter the corrupted catholic knows very well that i am not of his religion and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me and of what religion are you then madame asked felton with an astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could not entirely conceal				9746.586066513517
therefore he knew nothing either of the enemy s numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army				215.67026419194735
and he seated himself at the table and ate as he did in the merry days of the rue des fossoyeurs whilst d artagnan walked to and fro and thought how he could make use of planchet under present circumstances				1991.3367619678597

he took to his heels and was soon at m de trÃ©ville s but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd he asked to be introduced to m de trÃ©ville s office				245.77194865845843
to own the truth i should be inconsolable if you were to leave vincennes a droll way of showing your affliction the duke meant to say affection but my lord returned la ramee what would you do if you got out				34.452178737274

at the last hour we must confess this action and god knows better than we can whether it is a crime a fault or a meritorious deed				3416.5185187575967

the king has made him a baron and can make him a peer but he can not make him a gentleman and the count of morcerf is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry sum of two million francs to a mÃ©salliance				44661.50473791149
thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame				19549.796155877255

perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your duty to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i will even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low place in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me bravo cried chÃ¢teau renaud you are the first man i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism				575322.3525107332

then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth				380.5831760245871

alas said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully				6525.681501339862
i went to france with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life				240.88788260061074
that is forbidden it seems to me where forbidden asked mousqueton				106.57479978776811
d artagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into d artagnan s breast crying one for you and one for me the best for last cried d artagnan furious nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body				375.7534249703358

now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul				2132.1324146470633

my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly place the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal monsieur de morcerf replied the count your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made nay i will go still further and say that i had previously made up my mind to ask a great favor at your hands oh pray name it i am wholly a stranger to paris it is a city i have never yet seen is it possible exclaimed albert that you have reached your present age without visiting the finest capital in the world				44.231155935768804

he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe				2498.015071872456
i have sworn and now madame try to make your peace with god for you are judged by men milady let her head sink as if crushed by this sentence				389.23298026522605

raoul was seated at table with the count de guiche and his tutor when all at once the door opened and grimaud presented himself travel stained dirty and sprinkled with the blood of the unhappy executioner				5469.899978273242
he was moistened before and behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive oil				1573.940555495928

i congratulate you my dear m danglars said monte cristo i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of second rate fortunes i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins				13502.879853529155
but no i found nothing though i had made a hole twice as large as the first				2234.5695940118576

whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept				18766.497124697926

although d artagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words				1028.6124271278215
and at the very moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the window which was broken by the explosion				113865.65663745963
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion				60599.39195399624
silence and fatigue together overcame d artagnan and sleep overtook him also				363.4283619818315
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand				14.03961722208733

i will candidly explain the reason of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me				9.274895789129028

the young man sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully drawing the stone over the opening and hurried to his cell				296.66939482530677
he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pÃ¨res where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess				468.35907151710114
and whom i advised you to strangle porthos said aramis				15.030745296050775

tis well and may this money profit you				51.09583288824743

all night he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his way				328.9896297850459
at the same time the count appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black hair was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel				4099.677524781996
but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off as you please sir said caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trap door in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen				4130.905798765531

i wager that i uttered a thousand extravagances while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed him				11.044851878360063
the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count of monte cristo reappeared				547.04136530463
each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion his first and most indelible recollections were there not a tree not a street that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories				17819.892682690115
mercÃ©dÃ¨s remained therefore by his bedside and m morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney piece but availing himself of the doctor s order the old man would not take any sustenance at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercÃ©dÃ¨s if you ever see my edmond again tell him i die blessing him the abbÃ© rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat				5502.012771316604

he thought of his wife				99.31727567457794
i can not account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable				55358.899570990616
as they entered the circle the bandits could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young girl and of diavolaccio				43346.40568548077
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word				285.1745486625606
although he professes to be my enemy i have sympathy for him and if he is reasonable perhaps we shall arrange matters comminges bowed and returned to athos who was awaiting with apparent calmness but with real anxiety the result of the interview				2823.189192223217

before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making studies in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lion s skin to assume that of the woodman then with his hands covered with dirt his hair darkened by means of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time				600.717738815931

and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first time this garden the actual scene of my crime must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause				1421.9544244161136
well pray is there anything to be so surprised at he said				59.311360546834564

if i thought the fellow knew me by my name i would be rebaptized for fear it might be thought i knew him he knows you better by your actions than your name he is quite aware that there are two gentlemen who greatly aided the escape of monsieur de beaufort and he has instigated an active search for them i can answer for it by whom by me and this morning he sent for me to ask me if i had obtained any information and what did you reply that i had none as yet but that i was to dine to day with two gentlemen who would be able to give me some you told him that said porthos a broad smile spreading over his honest face				165.835564676393
give way said the traveller				4869.964203015961
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy				31730.7264519599
you will find yesterday s report of the minister of police				1142.455893026915

yes my lord and how much will that cost me monsieur d artagnan zounds my lord i don t know yet				1460.99063647499
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment				141.6236462421011
ah my poor friend				28.791329468495064
the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st honorÃ© turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door				134.43946010511337
in the rue saint honore athos fell in with two gentlemen whom he did not know on horseback like himself followed by a lackey like himself and going in the same direction that he was				86.00638349915103

his mother the councillor s old servant opened it				10.905265527619692
ah let him say now if he does not recognize me each word fell like a dagger on morcerf and deprived him of a portion of his energy as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom and fell back on his seat overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair				697.6879436733174
i wish to tell him to make my child happy i wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey me in fact i will know him i will continued the old lady with a fearful expression that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his duty madame said villefort you must lay aside these exalted ideas which almost assume the appearance of madness				3230.2709945882457
i am dead drunk that s all and never did a man more strongly set about getting so				82.92011497157885
i will continue then resumed aramis				21.910637218364105
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugÃ©nie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart				33.23207360281678
the second operation was as successful as the first la jeune amÃ©lie was in luck				68242.00108653557
i was pretty drunk yesterday d artagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous				1402.854625305214

what did he say some parting words to his friends his friends murmured cromwell				183.81120097513005
at the sight of his friend porthos uttered a loud cry of joy and mousqueton rising respectfully yielded his place to him and went to give an eye to the two stewpans of which he appeared to have the particular inspection				32309.412036546197
oliver cromwell considered it more expedient to declare himself to a mind as intelligent as mazarin s than to a queen admirable for firmness without doubt but too much guided by vain prejudices of birth and of divine right				2483.863988048633
he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden sent away barrois and after having seated himself at his father s right hand while madame de villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus i trust you will not be displeased sir that valentine has not come with us or that i dismissed barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either				8211.91891139806
albert seized them with a convulsive hand tore them in pieces and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to confront him he approached the wax light always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment				14375.495497641692
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once				155.09566350504642
he knows that we were sent from france by monsieur mazarin he will consider us as brothers				856.0859965462275

the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row				8220.757592289394
on the sixteenth day in particular these signs were so strong in d artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one place and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was expected				101.76787579082517
who has taken my piece of glass asked the duke frowning				1025.0176146472277
i will break every bone in your body cried the duke				13.129267303416238
then he had eaten some without saying a word more danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga				16789.131386764067
i shall buy a chestnut colored suit				887.4553511470374
moreover he had this advantage he was master of the count s secret while the count had no hold on franz who had nothing to conceal				5923.753809998943
the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz d Ã©pinay s possession signed by me and with a postscript of m luigi vampa				195.51808576177405
whither art thou going grimaud to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention				964.3462630917123
these steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards appeared				207.24079502125826
to speak its language tolerably to make a good appearance to be a good gamester and to pay in cash				23885.116861407478
now it is time that the malady should be over said she let me rise and obtain some success this very day				322.5943971442378
then valentine s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds				9325.418426596814
i see no one and yet the ladder didn t come down of itself no it is bazin ah				41.55694309583436
the day however passed away and the evening came on slowly but finally it came				739.9549584022654
you belong to the court doubtless yet i have never seen you at court				585.4868222746791
de villefort what do you mean i mean that m de nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a king s attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been enceinte six				1749.13890405162
one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak				658.2055127145401
you are come too late you are come to see me die				157.2090827040416
the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of first rate breeding and knowledge of the world then you accept his offer said the host				48.970505358834615
he was stopped by athos				59.31483931770553
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation				19376.266839832922
bazin remained at the window				61.531883620585475
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear				1484.0311500296107
the thing is simple enough				161.7510810204602
i am ready to speak my lord ah				56.62871504870233
signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear				2908.7622925702235
what can i do				54.90894509241749
the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day				141.61669067695925
remember that i never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived				331.04653954661507
he had seen in his province that land in which heads become so easily heated a few of the preliminaries of duels but the daring of these four fencers appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in gascony				66546.39925449903
the southern districts were ill watched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nÃ®mes or uzÃ¨s				8590.388151880641
speak gentlemen speak i am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing				250.15778669166488
then if he should forget that visit you would find no inconvenience in reminding him of it not at all ah that gives me more confidence this skillful turn of the conversation would have seemed a sublime manoeuvre to any one who could have read the gascon s soul				2841.264369690801
the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him				5.257222684089869
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism				31542.490008971945
monsieur said the prince turning toward raoul i know that you have a letter from my sister madame de longueville but i see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel my lord said raoul coloring up i did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count				87.1770653412623
well then all is settled you are to set off said the cardinal				16.9690216727251
d artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it				8.212407606709288
the elder prisoner pondered the matter				406.54484568237916
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could				1768.8426639147754
that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights				10548.17475175469
what is this said aramis to juxon				3023.3941219210064
it was m de villefort who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family as though they had been strangers				5538.37959385392
i was chosen				95.09494852926186
now gentlemen said the king in his turn excited by this sight come gentlemen sword in hand but aramis and athos were the only ones to obey this command and the king s example				695.5033115209529
when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived dantÃ¨s straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place				109.80846505335805
i will efface that blot on my father s character				864.2827291781247
the pope therefore blesses with the fingers				4380.124301046407
monsieur d artagnan monsieur du vallon you are free the order was obeyed d artagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle				9951.026438666991
farewell till the next time we meet cried chatillon and he set off full gallop				569.835590394011
yes and you will protect us who are your children against the will of my father noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel as if to say perhaps i may maximilian understood him				33.16236768384048
the cannon will warn everyone to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished				148914.9929715449
the presentation when albert found himself alone with monte cristo my dear count said he allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelor s apartment				182.23542177730732
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct				4593.873765390885
everyone must live certainly go on i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself				215.05687720892655
haydÃ©e had taken away ali and bertuccio remained with noirtier				357.1438144206808
the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one				298.5031652567398
it is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m franz d Ã©pinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will again you drive me to despair maximilian said valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound				911.3835391405801
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services				3365.2829298100683
as it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome especially when you have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo or the campo vaccino they wrote to signor pastrini the proprietor of the hÃ´tel de londres piazza di spagna to reserve comfortable apartments for them				21.0432247919895
she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her daughter s innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof				29934.544213128363
monte cristo on the contrary preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure and thus possessed the advantage				925.1245694605187
the prince who had a great repugnance to treat with such an ill bred fellow made out a list against the grain and sent it				9.004657876770834
really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream				563.175052292641
guiche summoned one of his grooms and delivering the prisoner into his charge with orders to shoot him through the head if he attempted to escape he leaped from his horse and approached raoul				252.08229265210488
d artagnan shows himself chapter x				755.5026067846475
adieu my noble and generous friend adieu i will go and tell valentine what you have done for me and slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the count s hand fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by monte cristo				1.058311103487495
now gentlemen a sortie cried athos				3.7717958683471373
do you see this firman i do said my father				39.4115403525751
d artagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends				65.28538238182689
and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbÃ© and not from the good abbÃ© himself and that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came it was i the comte de la fere said athos rising and bowing respectfully to the duchess de chevreuse				43.04763983114576
at one end was the receipted bill for the francs and at the other was a diamond as large as a hazel nut with these words on a small slip of parchment julie s dowry				54155.47384947455
this chase was however advantageous to him in one sense for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead his heart began to cool				69309.38500779388
each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy				9047.940436274923
i will do my best well then let us go i must trust to you it is very fortunate said d artagnan to himself				49.832307131728015
you will find good cigars on the centre table				199.99743826685759
on their way they met grimaud				70.60743081059998
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends				870.4958535593153
once outside he and planchet set off as fast as they could and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate				1235.4896410709528
i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers but i conjure you do not abandon me				4.810860673506095
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened athos you are becoming mad no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur d herblay and myself to madame henrietta				2332.8157984109585
she has never been so kind before				414.1273733545708
well said he when franz had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related				1963.8115952945266
six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my head				33.15929218839811
scarron turned around toward him and came to meet him in his chair				172.62878728616496
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts				8583.443777470795
the two friends exchanged a simple inclination of the head and aramis put his finger to his hat as if to bow athos alone comprehending by that signal that he had some project in his head				39.53439260373939
i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court				632.1240853364662
mazarin again				143.76488554325732
happily i vanquished death				379.04989544944823
i too would give up that good monsieur broussel dead or alive and all would be at an end if you yield him dead all will indeed be at an end my lord but quite otherwise than you mean did i say dead or alive replied mazarin				34.91025509135316
but d artagnan was too far off to hear him and if he had heard him in the disposition of mind he then enjoyed he certainly would not have remarked it				44.19867709025568
oh were i not a foreigner				15859.24413357397
you will be very kind to me will you not morrel to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus				1177.7196122328032
were you present during the last struggle asked m d avrigny				19.912649453913037
all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand				16593.92770680656
i think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality				9913.516760029906
it was seven o clock in the morning and daylight began to appear				1767.0874726030395
cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure				808.102411178169
do you not recollect morcerf his telling us so at your breakfast well then said the baroness if slave she be she has all the air and manner of a princess of the arabian nights if you like but tell me my dear lucien what it is that constitutes a princess				519.4759379674147
ah my friend said the abbÃ© turning towards dantÃ¨s and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you will see all this come to pass probably if ever i get out of prison true replied faria we are prisoners but i forget this sometimes and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond these walls and i fancy myself at liberty but wherefore are you here because in i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political face of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form one large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my cÃ¦sar borgia in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me				9.286062975339318
now my excellent signor pastrini said franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the count of monte cristo most assuredly replied he				997.6515737769645
not with us sir replied dantÃ¨s				90.40741998739524
the idiot how so if he loved her asked d artagnan				1.0458315615604619

athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached				2611.0455846002988
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread				16603.362208577008
well these boards you hear unloaded are the posts and planks to build my scaffold				3809.82827000621

hold sire said d artagnan they have just told the people that you are asleep you see you still are king the queen looked with surprise at this strange man whose brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest and who was by his fine and quick intelligence the equal of the most astute				30310.114733243463
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the garden but the count had positively forbidden it to be touched				883.3048861322835

at the letter s the old man stopped her				16.384037927769217
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athos s compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it but said d artagnan it is the queen s diamond the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos				4.750311213378148
my dear la ramee said the duke you are the only man to turn such faultless compliments no my lord duke replied la ramee in the fullness of his heart i say what i think there is no compliment in what i say to you then you are attached to me asked the duke				10.450533028470716

having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces				7666.784359565692
noirtier s eye remained immovable				260.37063430975627
it was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of arras				2801.213616730265

diable resumed aramis i have little fancy for the sea by day still less at night the sounds of wind and wave the frightful movements of the vessel i confess i prefer the convent of noisy athos smiled sadly for it was evident that he was thinking of other things as he listened to his friend and moved toward de winter				16.25908297273062
mazarin who had dispensed a thousand louis to make the people cry long live mazarin and who had accordingly no confidence in acclamations bought at twenty pistoles each kept one eye on porthos but that gigantic body guard replied to the look with his great bass voice be tranquil my lord and mazarin became more and more composed				17981.52403343978
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m andrea cavalcanti s solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration				2947.6044646889954
it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this has done what he has done				56.134574425151285
and who has seen this fleur de lis inquired aramis				14.049793369912402
ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we will dine together indeed replied villefort looking at his father with astonishment you really do seem very well informed eh				3693.940039751337
ah that would indeed be infamous how did danglars usually write in a handsome running hand and how was the anonymous letter written backhanded again the abbÃ© smiled				16.71884731789484
they arrived at the appointed spot				6523.628110771866
the accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed				5244.062487774921
the duke glanced at the clock				4367.577252368903
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happy				2060.7632820948056
ah fie d artagnan replied				107.45729425130263
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vain they opened again as soon as shut				1761.0109084096498
gentlemen return your swords to their scabbards well provided you replace your pistols in your belt willingly and d artagnan set the example				915.7248859520596
you see your friends are wakeful				100702.61280965577
you will soon know but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation dantÃ¨s trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent				270.48144861347737
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over				154.8172498413388
lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpent like embraces				4141.74584932833
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers the soldier s throat				984.5599084957101
no for your skill with the sword is so well known ah who has betrayed me the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered and you failed they positively refused morrel said the count have you ever seen me fire a pistol never well we have time look monte cristo took the pistols he held in his hand when mercÃ©dÃ¨s entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron plate with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the club				17124.90487338845

it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of d artagnan which might cast his master back again into that vortex of mundane affairs which had so long carried him away				165.14705492826266
i did hope man is a poor wretched creature i did hope				345.0985776866089
go sir then said the queen you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court your majesty answered mazarin desires me to do only what i was going to ask you to let me do				88.09531064566923
there was no longer any doubt the bankrupt was in the hands of roman banditti				4837.123700319049
athos at the same moment moved by a similar impulse looked back also				293.2150491001669

soon he saw the lights of la consigne				1412.9623232416805
the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of richelieu the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austria to declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter				187.38472074162874
the night passed in perfect silence				300.6119058893391
albert entered				25.012819787981865
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses				28771.76850845939
there was more especially one upon whom their arrival had produced a decided impression				2645.2133226880487
then he went to bed and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of age even when they are torn with remorse				4325.817482477967

emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered				15186.271763053679
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass				714.331568809195
sit down my dear friend and let us talk and aramis pushed forward a large easy chair in which d artagnan stretched himself out				870.2709066840291
you need not look for it i do not want it said the old man				1.8192452055605923
five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs				59.80767943458105
your holiness said gondy my friend you take me for some one else no your holiness i take you for what you are that is to say the coadjutor i recognized you at the first glance gondy smiled				671.3756673050955
he complicated this exordium by an exposition in which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal that incomparable minister that conqueror of past ministers that example for ministers to come deeds and power which none could thwart with impunity				1162.5393741693288
he therefore approached the bed and while his companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale face which looked like that of a sleeping angel				3757.2244129990795
as the shadows of night deepened the troops summoned by the prince arrived in successive detachments				44055.22139517067

de flamarens and de chatillon continued on their way and athos and aramis dismounted				23985.64487500919

grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort				157.20391033300754
everyone is free to ask what he pleases that s true replied jacopo i only make a remark well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them no said jacopo but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers that is all i want interrupted dantÃ¨s				191.8420509868937

milady passed her two arms round felton s neck and let herself slip out of the window				46.84495143310192
aramis received a ball which passed through his shoulder and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part which prolongs the lower portion of the loins				15435.486233933092
he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find him				5.846735350575224
that is not an answer replied athos				3.377329276483322
i understand perfectly again danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial				4854.314687424372
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to d artagnan s deliberations this was the name of madame de longueville				271.32885325609226

on the entrance of the new comers their eyes glanced from father to son and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising				1764283.1259038043
this harsh letter coming as it did from a man generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of villefort				257.1775083712312
i shall strangle you both if you don t get out said porthos at last seizing mousqueton by the throat				1137.669831407178

as for franz he remained at florence and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise of the cascine and spending two or three evenings at the houses of the florentine nobility he took a fancy into his head having already visited corsica the cradle of bonaparte to visit elba the waiting place of napoleon				43105.94849327699

one of the two men whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire stranger to him but not so the other and though franz had been unable to distinguish his features from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the shadow the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might				1109.9345745340322

d artagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men				268.5736943983659
in fact the sack of la rochelle and the assassination of three of four thousand huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed would resemble too closely in the massacre of st bartholomew in and then above all this this extreme measure which was not at all repugnant to the king good catholic as he was always fell before this argument of the besieging generals la rochelle is impregnable except to famine				26062.951733312264

armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step				359.803528518514
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercÃ©dÃ¨s in the world and he might yet be happy				1525.959287725688
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him				7.156058953841281
from the signs of respect the valet paid him he saw that his note had produced a good effect				6550.747486134724
at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions				1535.8550441041925
morrel whispered what have you done to him i				355.2296875367633
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saint remy				124.14724903002293
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor				5285.403878648565
the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends				98.72974272024099

accused said the president your name and surname andrea arose				561.7557153863037
this time the poor girl did not even argue with d artagnan she gave it to him at once				57.87393534940858
franz was too far off to hear what they said but without doubt nothing hostile passed for he saw albert disappear arm in arm with the peasant girl				499.75930219996627
ah said the marquise de saint mÃ©ran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed am i not right villefort i beg your pardon madame				311.5179576347671
the inquiry m de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars to endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the history of the house at auteuil				2798.728939317059
along the isle of dogs and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another				216.6000816408714
ah good evening my dear m caderousse said monte cristo what are you doing here at such an hour the abbÃ© busoni exclaimed caderousse and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied				4681.456306982448
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him				7.849767648940012
which means resumed aramis that he might perfectly understand the two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders when they bestow the benediction an admirable subject cried the jesuit				758.3586634794374
villefort closely watching his countenance and his lips awaited the result of the examination				3921.84974443822
i am for those who save the state said bonacieux emphatically				1021.2429954533847
well what is it what is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out				50.24849041471011
the whole assembly manifested great surprise but andrea appeared quite unmoved				307.74335317108927
d artagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word				559.8600191346859
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude				1796.201046687558
i actually love no one sir you know it do you not				22.10769654727366
the signatures were perfectly legal				2849.627767737605
meanwhile madame if you really suffer said felton a physician shall be sent for and if you deceive us well it will be the worse for you				22.725880842382843
she told d artagnan that lord de winter was her brother in law and not her brother				172.1355161324563
gentlemen said athos who had assumed the command of the expedition while grimaud spreads the table let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together				1200.5140549085559
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain clear				2498.501106884344
you are in prison then rochefort trembled in every limb at this question				193.87587078160206
but i think i have it said athos				4.0757165927807115
it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between albert and the fair peasant continued all day				551.0028169489179
i will swear to you by my soul s salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment tis well said the abbÃ© convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth				398.2836728975857
one of the noble peers who was familiar with the arabic language having studied it during the famous egyptian campaign followed with his eye as the translator read aloud i el kobbir a slave merchant and purveyor of the harem of his highness acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor from the french lord the count of monte cristo an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand francs as the ransom of a young christian slave of eleven years of age named haydÃ©e the acknowledged daughter of the late lord ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his favorite she having been sold to me seven years previously with her mother who had died on arriving at constantinople by a french colonel in the service of the vizier ali tepelini named fernand mondego				10409.76644107837

i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of roman crowns about francs				369.0068615863635
is anyone ill in the house the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets				16625.87785976048
dantÃ¨s folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently				29274.175421441545
at nine o clock madame la premiÃ¨re prÃ©sidente arrived				137.91580242270177
it was mousqueton				820.0727242574488
it is well madame i believe your oath no no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read i command you for i am resolved that everything shall be finished to night and never will i recur to this subject again				158.5909943676038
see count she said with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost detect the tears on her eyelids see our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you will make allowance for our northern sun the count bowed but stepped back				254.67203925636161
d artagnan took his hat examined the hole made by the ball and shook his head				13.594254959123596
all this she owes to d artagnan without doubt				1076.6188709459157
it is over aramis had said				11.414062670810742
m de villefort would stifle the affair he had only to turn his eyes on one side and allow andrea to fly and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt of court				420.00796121930983
two hours afterwards he came on deck as the boat was about to double the island of elba				124955.62568515833
athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will				651.9408036579399
the counsels of his friend joined to the cries of his own heart made him determine now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied not to see milady again				78.12217778106604
we are first said morrel looking out of the window				34.815963673336704
and grandpapa inquired the young girl trembling with apprehension				253025.86264771456
who is there answered the voice of her he sought				5569.603552910725
as he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely white				37906.98021709726
you know that it was in leaving his house that m de caderousse was murdered by his friend benedetto				1148.7428335929046
good bye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man				1.9465379824201166
the carriage in which a broussel is to be arrested ought to be able to bear ten thousand men what are your commands lieutenant take the detachment and conduct him to his place but you will be left alone certainly				3630.07334734371
aramis returned soon with a man from the hotel de rohan who was saying to him you swear sir that it is not so stop and aramis gave him a louis d or				228.77811626878812
you will see said the man proudly in five minutes he will speak i have then five minutes said monte cristo to himself it is more time than i require				1805.9021220072937
the same flower of innocence had flourished or was still flourishing on their brow that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house villefort shrieked clasped his hands and looked at the doctor with a supplicating air				139.25674994374535
with a word d artagnan reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palais cardinal				185.91956618524128
i therefore may hesitate between you				10.765412857365575
do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said d artagnan to the youth				4447.3025565173375
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand and with the right held out the reins to andrea who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the step				513.6927422496852
if i had wished to widen the breach between those whom monsieur d herblay chooses to receive with a rope ladder and those whom he receives with a wooden ladder i could have spoken out what are you meddling with cried aramis pale with anger suspecting that d artagnan had acted as a spy on him and had seen him with madame de longueville				361.9641941389385
fortunately nothing is lost by this delay and you are now about to hear it				7.198572015497652
it followed that d artagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friends athos porthos and aramis				15.05308776878707
the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the other signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man s face				58.620250456944774
let him come yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come moreover he is but a child said aramis				17.54786933412825
do not call anyone do not be alarmed said the count do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the man standing before you valentine for this time it is no ghost is nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend you could dream of valentine could not reply the voice which indicated the real presence of a being in the room alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire if your intentions are pure why are you here the count s marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young girl s mind				124.01625376974418
go on my child said the count in the romaic language				1128.567765064907
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment d artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity				80671.49143161894
with one word you have crushed it and i die but the duel will not take place edmond since you forgive it will take place said monte cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your son s blood to stain the ground mine will flow mercÃ©dÃ¨s shrieked and sprang towards monte cristo but suddenly stopping edmond said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again i trust to him from my heart				34.269295644816
as he was about to leave the presence the cardinal gave him a friendly smile and said a perfect harmony reigns sire between the leaders and the soldiers of your musketeers which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all he will play me some dog s trick or other and that immediately said trÃ©ville				336.410678857939
at half past two in the morning morcerf was conducted to his apartments where a bath and supper were prepared				18685.81185715382

byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them				14.925588334005573
without courting danger he never shrank from an encounter in short he had been a soldier and arms ennoble a man it was therefore on the footing of friends that d artagnan and planchet arrived in the neighborhood of blois				756.0943717382454
he was moderately reassured however by the aspect of that countenance full of astute intelligence and affected humility				682.3356929998275
i have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron s heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some manfred some lara some werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society you say i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag				4317.068073866602
now leave me or i will summon my servants to throw you out at the door wild almost unconscious and with eyes inflamed albert stepped back and morrel closed the door				19.072816892735613
the result then of six more such months as this would be to reduce the third rate house to despair oh said danglars becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such months continued monte cristo in the same tone				435.0671940679361
bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits				266829.13395384944

i your son as you call me i will not let you twas the first time d artagnan had ever refused a request from athos				29.890004248194728
all the other guests followed				748.0767280977387
now at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused				250.752649083059
a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in				430.8843684528195
no by your eminence by me				9.118688202948068
the two travelers proceeded to the rue saint dominique and stopped at the door of a magnificent hotel surmounted with the arms of de luynes				158.96872203778878
what could explain athos s having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table				111.06582706239655
monsieur said mademoiselle d aubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voiture s friends				47.29397206225103
i feel cramps over my whole body do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes yes any noise in the ears frightful when did you first feel that just now suddenly yes like a clap of thunder did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before nothing no drowsiness none what have you eaten today i have eaten nothing i only drank a glass of my master s lemonade that s all and barrois turned towards noirtier who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him				6.3371173194405435
four men disguised as workmen were to get the king out of prison and take him to greenwich where a vessel was waiting and knowing all that your honor remained here far from the city tranquil and inactive tranquil yes replied cromwell				216.76405374447577
it is needless to say that this transformation was visible only to the prisoner s feverish imagination				3541.727767480595
it seemed to him as though he were in a madhouse and was becoming as mad as those he saw				5464.508772613258
her reputation would be lost it is true but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer				4768.693523764808
what do you wish to say about it i desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified to what do you refer				37858.641142188164
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort and then my lord continued rochefort you understand that to emerge from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change one s prison say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said mazarin				42.48606013867532
i love you you permit me to tell you that i do that is already more happiness than i dared to hope silence said mme				28.022194173414267
that is to say athos will be chief engineer porthos purveyor in general and aramis governor of the fortress meanwhile they gave up to mazarin the handsomest room in the chateau				1774.7939141313357
it is eleven o clock in the morning and the pious sisters have just finished saying mass for the success of the armies of king charles i				11.195253703767257
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthy that of being the husband of mercÃ©dÃ¨s nay nay cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet				2796.5584881080354
your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon you beware athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile				80.0909207310273
at the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp pale brow				855.8390629301138
or rather sir said aramis with his peculiar irritating politeness the error of the person who was with you when we met you in the guardroom for if the comte de la fere and i are not mistaken we saw you in the company of a third gentleman chatillon and flamarens started				92.00346756313816
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face				81.93386515024714
stay where you are i will go myself and with a light step an eye on the watch observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground d artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier				1514.1773155367473
in two bounds he was at the louvre as he entered the wicket of l echelle ten o clock struck				267.4173225219061

d artagnan returned				85.05031535675909
so long as he was surrounded by his friends he retained his youth and the poetry of his character				551.2690354597315
some of that at the bottom near the laths				62819.471671030726
the trial chapter				1.1312049602905894
my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god				1671.0850230073927
only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas what are they sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment				827.4395931289297
ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven o clock then you have received full information concerning my arrival of course ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my coming oh no it has not but you are sure you are not mistaken very sure it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o clock this evening i will prove it to you beyond a doubt oh no never mind that said the italian it is not worth the trouble yes yes said monte cristo				1.0498452195791241

it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back staircase or by the window in the dressing room				43.813230447965594
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders				69.07588275099212
the boat that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in sight white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cable s length of shore				11767.541274418849
i will try and think over what is the best thing to be done you will give me your advice will you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant position				750.4640708242475

this traveling dress will serve to show the cardinal my haste to obey his commands they set out on vulcan and bayard followed by mousqueton on phoebus and arrived at the palais royal at about a quarter to seven				3500.9394604208783
you know i used to be a good cook do you recollect how you used to lick your fingers				3486.2032437046255

speak speak take this letter said d artagnan				1.0281690353094706
with a little more heart he might have been contented with this new conquest but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride				777.0307368801159
what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you eh parbleu they should kill me the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words				540.7754002278023
i carry no sword this morning and can not return home to procure one no said lord de winter we are going to pay a visit to her majesty the queen of england oh very well replied aramis then bending his face down to athos s ear what is the object of this visit continued he				48.57983432722164
he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing				168.03322375133868
at two o clock the tennis balls began according to grimaud s directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of la ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over				217.34199152023092
the day passed in pursuing those exercises in which monte cristo excelled				1125.5050511856946

forsooth i don t know half a pistole if you can find out said d artagnan				1.0268980268646688
i once thought continued faria of removing these iron bars and letting myself down from the window which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight however i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a sort of inner court and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger				413.4644009598978
maximilian said the count without appearing to notice the different impressions which his presence produced on the little circle i come to seek you to seek me repeated morrel as if awakening from a dream				327.0894274864177

show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed unless said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects oh my lord my lord that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public but your honor will soon be called so generally i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak				654.724036830889
in the midst of this avenue was a nobleman dressed in green and with as much gilding about him as the iron gate riding on a tall horse				277.7326378218044
my faith replied d artagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward d artagnan stood quite astonished				333.95414228335386
and i who have answered for him to the queen i who have promised my poor mistress ah my god my god				39.25865683006494

that door is guarded d artagnan you know that very well you will force it said porthos				12.793952606390663
grimaud drew out a pistol				1064.3194566907046
sometimes grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the contrary				9285.536956170376
at chÃ¢lons i was put upon the saÃ´ne thence i passed on to the rhÃ´ne whence i descended merely with the current to arles at arles i was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to marseilles				168.08988131193254
the same day they came for me and took me to the bastile				502.9860610262509
that god desirous in his mercy to punish but one person has visited this justice on him alone monte cristo with a smile on his lips uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made villefort fly had he but heard it				5.992954709469623
draw if you please and instantly not so if you please my good friend not here at least				1557.3952553884087
go into the grotto and dress yourself at these words he drew away the stone and showed teresa the grotto lighted up by two wax lights which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror on a rustic table made by luigi were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond pins and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume				1290.4502009332655
ah i miss three they were here last night sir i am sure they were here i counted them				104.59083050529262
as monte cristo approached she leaned upon the elbow of the arm that held the narghile and extending to him her other hand said with a smile of captivating sweetness in the sonorous language spoken by the women of athens and sparta why demand permission ere you enter				2025.570063862685
de monte cristo she exclaimed and how is he connected with the question you asked me you know mother m de monte cristo is almost an oriental and it is customary with the orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not eating or drinking in the houses of their enemies do you say m de monte cristo is our enemy replied mercÃ©dÃ¨s becoming paler than the sheet which covered her				22.06831071939786

all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy even the mild countenance of aramis				109.78234014412959
then he saw through the whole thing				655.3087300664753
since the bandits had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all				56.157545253527196
strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life				263.9180850395324
if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping the scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbÃ© s plan has not even the merit of originality then turning to faria i inquired if you are well fed said he				30.894840599302917
d artagnan trembled and he likewise recollected that during the past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him without doubt carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance				936.6100588463074
now lift me on my bed for i can no longer support myself edmond took the old man in his arms and laid him on the bed				124.9736092051963
m de villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death				474.37935653686196
d artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy				1389.6588234300941
the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short time ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few years				407.91869079597654
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient families				15213.494752257613
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint mÃ©ran s morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear				1044.0761224970897
a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat				11983.818964174156
saved my child said morrel what do you mean yes saved saved				36382.57971468201
who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst d artagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads				2357.5944370487173

de saint mÃ©ran is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without expression she appeared to be stupefied				965.1255401915699
the garden became darker still but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps				535.2642874302022
the spit turned the stove roared the pretty madeleine wept d artagnan felt himself invaded by hunger cold and love				350.77687487605095

he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him				10.746497703456319
good said he it was time and he sealed his will with three seals				12252.795192167747
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me				18.619547671015336
the next day just as debray was signing the deed that is about five o clock in the afternoon madame de morcerf after having affectionately embraced her son entered the coupÃ© of the diligence which closed upon her				10.910396569685824
at the corner of the street he met mousqueton and took him with him				14.94966700803959
the thunder growled in the distance but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller caderousse or la carconte absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain				9901.970375914889

the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves				47017.76340561436
well when i was a clerk morcerf was a mere fisherman and then he was called fernand only fernand fernand mondego you are sure pardieu i have bought enough fish of him to know his name then why did you think of giving your daughter to him because fernand and danglars being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me what oh nothing ah yes what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of fernand mondego				10838.699504625725

nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold				287.531965320595
in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation felton started and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan				5947.386787732475
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity				582.2752996676315
the blow was sped by d artagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom				257.94387033059473
tut tut answered the abbÃ© man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known				962.6358118747881
i who was looking on an eager and curious spectator i who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy i who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful i am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course i was watching and bitten to the heart morrel groaned				6456.689286975757
he was at the moment conversing cheerfully with morrel but he was well prepared for what might happen				5898.6450504279455
but how				175.67092141585857
soon the two gentlemen stopped also				2107.8289699775914
with regard to athos he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at full gallop only instead of following the road he went across the fields urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to listen				951.4370973256356
at what time six o clock where at saint mande who told you the count de rochefort some one drew near				1767.9488329223552
oh death is in my house cried villefort				44.17296183874588
at the same moment that he quitted the room villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door				79.50816632040598
it is too late				559.3618227615067
what is your name in your turn if you please d artagnan to yours monsieur and above all others cried d artagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm to that of the king and the cardinal the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of d artagnan if the wine had been bad but the wine was good and he was convinced				1592.0548190143386
as i had nothing more to do at versailles i went to auteuil and gained all the information i could				6885.227184168788
during our expedition to bÃ©thune the husband of my duchess died so my dear the coffer of the defunct holding out its arms to me i shall marry the widow				12852.899305652352
they would have found they have not found but they are on the track yes that the usual phrase i am quite familiar with it				5.57743447943536
the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space				6169.72387334206
the king is alone with a few gentlemen whom he fears to lose every day surrounded by the scotch whom he distrusts although he be himself a scotchman				4990.684767505071
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdiniÃ¨re his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on				56.960085550523836
but the royal couriers have been more expeditious than you and here are monsieur de flamarens and monsieur de chatillon who bring me from her majesty the queen anne of austria the very latest intelligence aramis and athos were astounded by the calmness even the gayety of the queen s manner				403.7120612981859
go to sleep soon louis said the queen for you must be awakened very early i will do my best to obey you madame said the youthful king but i have no inclination to sleep laporte said anne of austria in an undertone find some very dull book to read to his majesty but do not undress yourself the king went out accompanied by the chevalier de coislin bearing the candlestick and then the queen returned to her own apartment				315.6653207854292
the two friends were in the via dei pontefici				14457.905803038546
two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part while i must do the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i declared could exculpate me if he would				11084.098073522695
he had taken the lady as far as fromelles and from fromelles she had set out for armentiÃ¨res				10090.396114738196
i took a week to go another to return four days of quarantine and forty eight hours to stay there that makes three weeks				29886.79331202611
he has orders to do so				38.97861723841569
her face as she looked at athos had taken on an expression that can not be described				2875.699553653342
but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured				20392.70718155517
is your horse tired tired				26041.112844151343
felton grew pale				56.80615702444726
d artagnan i ask your pardon for having yesterday crossed swords with you aramis does the same to porthos now hate me if you can but for my own part i shall ever even if you do hate me retain esteem and friendship for you				22.051159651469547
i beg your excellency s pardon for keeping you waiting said the man in the roman dialect but i don t think i m many minutes after my time ten o clock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran say not a word about being late replied the stranger in purest tuscan tis i who am too soon				8613.76012887562
oh of the most unfortunate kind monsieur				126.17409969563778
and now once more adieu said morrel				41.423647738637264
kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded				26631.775351458502
dantÃ¨s would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his voice				195.63904284538856
didn t you hear fellow yes i heard why then didn t you reply because these horses are not to be sold was the reply				660.6868223996184
good replied athos whose blood mounted to his face at the insult offered to royalty tell the captain we are coming the puritan then went out				42.026057100654405
mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please i want capital to build my plans upon capital nothing replied mercÃ©dÃ¨s with a mournful smile				69.58681909660206
but you are here my dear fellow let us speak of you				17.079451623058155
go my son go my dear gÃ©rard and by your obedience to my paternal orders or if you prefer it friendly counsels we will keep you in your place				373.6704189046801
listen sir				15.447530759184351
this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal what do you think d artagnan asked athos				3.811105690202363
he ran to porthos and threw himself into his arms the whole body of servants arranged in a semi circle at a respectful distance looked on with humble curiosity				618.4813727628728
even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy gates rolled on their hinges they had seen the count coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning				413.919488249688
it was then in the neighborhood of noyon that he must seek that estate				20527.06680404968
a man whose name is franz d Ã©pinay or albert de morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them no he arrived accompanied simply by the guest i am going to present to you ah this gentleman is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda no he is a man about my own size armed to the teeth he had not even a knitting needle but he paid your ransom he said two words to the chief and i was free and they apologized to him for having carried you off said beauchamp				41.26085368972849
you have seen your dream realized i can still say it is a dream a retired baker my poor benedetto is rich he has an annuity well you have an annuity i have yes since i bring you your two hundred francs caderousse shrugged his shoulders				59.23109442385767
well i was but four years old when one night i was suddenly awakened by my mother				341.654284644426
oh mon dieu he said raising his fine eyes to d artagnan moist with tears the count has left paris without seeing me he left four days ago said d artagnan				1.036289216061862
i will tell you mr president				986.6795179438866
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the right and were now opposite the point des catalans				9516.767012499358
every reproach his friend uttered struck deeply in his heart				30.622653792844257
tell your client that although i am the insulted party in order to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of arms and will accept without discussion without dispute anything even combat by drawing lots which is always stupid but with me different from other people as i am sure to gain sure to gain repeated beauchamp looking with amazement at the count				21.796199308789454
this was the more so because bonacieux s reflections were all rose colored				10553.809589358332
it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the night had suddenly changed into a vast tomb				585.4075399912834
from the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple elegance				541.660073340957
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river				288.54462638085255
the maid approached planchet whom she took for lubin and holding out a little billet to him said for your master for my master replied planchet astonished				52.08073072847213
madame de longueville is ill said the duke and she desired me to excuse her to your majesty anne gave a quick glance to mazarin who answered by an almost imperceptible shake of his head				42.47552679989451
you have only to descend by the private stairs and you will find me at the door go sir said the queen i will follow you d artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and the musketeer on the box				715.5260983664705
lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a fight				560.2878557455507
i would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have lost it he would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him				12.754390296524889
he arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before mercÃ©dÃ¨s with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched say mercÃ©dÃ¨s he said once for all is this your final determination i love edmond dantÃ¨s the young girl calmly replied and none but edmond shall ever be my husband and you will always love him as long as i live fernand let fall his head like a defeated man heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the face with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils said but if he is dead if he is dead i shall die too if he has forgotten you mercÃ©dÃ¨s called a joyous voice from without mercÃ©dÃ¨s ah exclaimed the young girl blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of love you see he has not forgotten me for here he is and rushing towards the door she opened it saying here edmond here i am fernand pale and trembling drew back like a traveller at the sight of a serpent and fell into a chair beside him				4.510032068712627
my child said vasiliki may god preserve you from ever wishing for that death which today you so much dread then whispering to selim she asked what were her master s orders				378.56544699947676
she opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents				8678.404914939922
then your grace knows her real name asked felton in a sharp tone				113.65230213578278
long life to his eminence				262.5992536930031
i can not recollect whether it was by steel or by poison only of this i am sure i have dreamed he was dead and you know my dreams never deceive me				5.279514248000102
peppino had a little spare time so he had a game of morra with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto				47156.926972705165
ma foi i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow creatures				1971.1753143288092
well will you take me or shall i take edward madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue				486.66467826593424
for about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man and his wife with two servants a chambermaid named trinette and a hostler called pecaud				11203.550920040758
he said as to your friend tell him he may sleep in peace good very good said porthos that signified as clear as daylight that he still intends to make me a baron at this moment nine o clock struck				637.0302547428647
danglars looked at the two men one after the other the one brutalized by liquor the other overwhelmed with love				336.5685623974359
and with my grandfather s consent i shall fulfil the promise which i have made you valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone that nothing but morrel s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them				20.212142176206424
keep guard at the other door athos and aramis				32.842817451447814
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners				5272.344841338561
you have one at heart aramis one deeper and more painful a wound made by a woman the eye of aramis kindled in spite of himself				70.53787282934599
you will see the same at every opening from this palace to which i should lead you				20.03446752334229
what do you want me for sir demanded he of the paralytic				3882.973919636616
oh no said he but help me to die if you can are you a priest asked raoul				63.145225522925095
oh god be praised he said it is a real bed this was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name of god				1563.134405116266
and her son florentin his valet thinks he is going to do the same come this way monte cristo took bertuccio into his study wrote the letter we have seen and gave it to the steward				2525.6995133131727
you will find him quite enthusiastic upon what subject asked madame danglars				12.534983873972765
all that however has nothing to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own person my family or connections i can in any way serve you				13.607699298538337
then you know what i have suffered said mme				13.491242451813122
she only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm the fair round arm of a woman but twenty five years old and who yet spread death around her				11.870391424082506
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father s mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank				1687.0657874423378
moreover it is possible that the genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know and believe nothing but what they should believe				18052.400988961563
their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said in observing the proceeding of the cardinal and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived				160.83262489365214
where are you asked the valet de chambre whose eyes dazzled by the light could not clearly distinguish our heroes in the gloom				3189.986333565904
ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it mean the pharaon come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study				1245.9387475624787
the trial at eight o clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp s door				50.32579798276745
twenty four years ago i returned proud and joyful to my country				1375.1647894501984
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and d avrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child d avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish				1352.5065986008474
as for his wife he bowed to her as some husbands do to their wives but in a way that bachelors will never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal life				584.390386260445
grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring				1752.216767514996
i do not know the young man he is said to be of good family and rich but i never trust to vague assertions				30305.114411560407
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers				596.5894286989001
and as soon as he saw the two cavaliers he ran to them with open arms				352.6612905789228
by the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes the doctor without shaking hands with villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household				506.40555340997764
who has consoled me in my sorrow but he				252.73607736891248
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting heart i returned to the thicket which now contained no hope for me oh cried madame danglars it was enough to drive you mad i hoped for a moment that it might said villefort but that happiness was denied me				17.354106173141854
at that moment he cut it				11.626024965222827
i beseech you the superior and mme				20.547355732450825
poisons act particularly on some organ or another one on the stomach another on the brain another on the intestines				28490.449896493938
will they dare to arrest a man in his majesty s service pardieu they did not scruple much in the case of athos				35.91599423973547
at the door of her apartment the baroness met mademoiselle cornÃ©lie her confidential maid				1599.5180093898146
it is well said monte cristo				1.1047503903678257
monsieur de st merri you begin my lord i have in my parish a man who might be of the greatest use to you who and what is this man a shopkeeper in the rue des lombards who has great influence upon the commerce of his quarter what is his name he is named planchet who himself also caused a rising about six weeks ago but as he was searched for after this emeute he disappeared and can you find him i hope so				22.974039093632793
and the coadjutor and madame de longueville and if the worthy broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest i should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks well sir i will obey you although i do not understand you it is unnecessary for you to understand				358.5272749339324
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you				7.248262365627623
the more profoundly she wounded his heart the more certainly he would avenge her				11.34154484706308
now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a woman s weakness there are twelve days well monsieur duke said the king have you made your calculations yes sire				379.52700096895427
it became necessary therefore to destroy this last bulwark of calvinism a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling				8693.257144288536
as for benedetto he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket handkerchief				2962.1410173976565
i was about to give it when you anticipated me that then is your opinion asked aramis				20.61466846712894
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk				2220.6663590315593
aramis obeyed				8.940229808963606
milady replied that she was too weak at present and that her only desire was to be left alone				504.201850324871
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and d artagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a sensation				34313.64405244298
planchet was in truth no vulgar companion in these new adventures he was a man of uncommonly sound sense				22120.81652288486
we must ask the comte de la fere the question				84.63438819855052
stop a moment does not that sunbeam yonder just by the side of the town glitter on the ironsides this was the name given the cuirassiers whom cromwell had made his body guard				549.358167949328
d artagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey				245.42179067472128
but perhaps you have never loved child replied the count				6.402314282186261
it is no nonsense it is quite true				208.86540796193123
but since the end of the month m morrel had passed many an anxious hour				574.6576933290099
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe				16199.500250289322
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them it was past midnight the next thing was to find planchet				758.5973660081999
you see said he calling d artagnan s attention to the fact that they had come back to the chateau after an hour s walk we have made a tour of my domains all is charming and everything savors of nobility replied d artagnan				1.0251890418693852
in a month you will find on the table at which we shall be then sitting good pistols and a delicious draught but on the other hand you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time oh i also swear it monte cristo drew the young man towards him and pressed him for some time to his heart				31.498583885531183
i want to go into master broussel s house captain replied friquet in that wheedling way the gamins of paris know so well how to assume when necessary				2436.363024240694
the only precaution he had taken in coming to the archbishopric was to leave his arquebuse in the hands of a friend				1754.5812177788748
well then believe me athos your mission is ended and ended nobly return to france with us friend said athos our resolution is irrevocable then you have some other motive unknown to us athos smiled and d artagnan struck his hands together in anger and muttered the most convincing reasons that he could discover but to all these reasons athos contented himself by replying with a calm sweet smile and aramis by nodding his head				23.802781111902288
mousqueton therefore was soon provided with tools and he began his task				3575.5328995692994
i will run then till my legs no longer serve till my heart bursts in my bosom but i will arrive before they do mordaunt proceeded at a rapid pace to the nearest cavalry barracks about a quarter of a league distant				14332.976667653404
i will not attempt to argue with you but i blame you heyday cried d artagnan what matters it to me after all if cromwell who s an englishman revolts against his king who is a scotchman				5635.439002877831
i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden				264.52674761086666
d artagnan looked much disconcerted				13789.726721520772
when my morning and evening meals are brought thought he i will cast them out of the window and they will think that i have eaten them he kept his word twice a day he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his jailer brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret				3948.0959086811004
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them				28.848016400356084
i have them at hand monsieur porthos take yours from your holsters i have them good said d artagnan seizing his own now you understand porthos not too well we are out on the king s service well for the king s service we need horses that is true said porthos				11.359251155204044
the troop continued its course as though their steeds had wings				44021.62274714896
grimaud had a stout short picard cob which cost three hundred livres				276.7357521350772
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner				17917.229421600834
excuse me mr president he said in a clear voice but i see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which i can not follow you				9.603829931756538
on entering the hotel d artagnan saw a man sitting in a corner by the fire				734.0299582488057
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m bazin				589.1895450186304
your holiness said the curate here is the person of whom i had the honor to speak to you planchet saluted in the manner of one accustomed to fine houses				8408.382834269445
but never mind that sort of intoxication is not dangerous and will have no bad effects and lord de winter retired swearing which at that period was a very knightly habit				22039.493412219468

though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean				12830.463207479519

it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope				1708.7423593872213
gaetano departed with the reply				408.4780980310921
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence				427.74898057403163

the heart of the young gascon beat as if it would burst through his side not from fear god be thanked he had not the shade of it but with emulation he fought like a furious tiger turning ten times round his adversary and changing his ground and his guard twenty times				3049.130106818723

m d Ã©pinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history				751.5896339475819
during that time he had many moments of despair				452.63824541139286
thus villefort passed through the mass of spectators and officers of the palais and withdrew				377.53341324925003

at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats				78634.65220591846

i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull eyes and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies meanwhile danglars who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange tree one after another				259.45536659201156

a part of the good abbÃ© s words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home				406.6026187822791

have you been long in the orangery he asked in a trembling voice remembering the visits he had been paying to his treasury				147608.94842415414

the circumstances that had hastened the return of d artagnan to paris were as follows one evening when mazarin according to custom went to visit the queen in passing the guard chamber he heard loud voices wishing to know on what topic the soldiers were conversing he approached with his wonted wolf like step pushed open the door and put his head close to the chink				89938.7528192756

the good wine which mousqueton had placed before them traced out in glowing drops to d artagnan a fine perspective shining with quadruples and pistoles and showed to porthos a blue ribbon and a ducal mantle they were in fact asleep on the table when the servants came to light them to their bed				421.5886980196932
the treasure will be no more mine than yours and neither of us will quit this prison				811.98353004706

i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot day then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller he had to entertain caderousse hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons				4669.978559418607

dantÃ¨s was tossed about on these doubts and wishes when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his service took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade				450.9200170677792
oh am i happy enough for that yes you have called haydÃ©e your sister let her become so indeed valentine render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me protect her for the count s voice was thick with emotion henceforth she will be alone in the world alone in the world repeated a voice behind the count and why monte cristo turned around haydÃ©e was standing pale motionless looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement				521.3029985327718
death is about to return to the tomb the phantom to retire in darkness what do you say edmond i say since you command me mercÃ©dÃ¨s i must die die				210.55194641296978

grimaud bazin mousqueton and planchet				116.99438812842608

bonacieux opening a cupboard and taking from it the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so affectionately take this bag the cardinal s cried d artagnan breaking into a loud laugh he having heard as may be remembered thanks to the broken boards every syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife				120.72626327798042
yes sir who is it a woman accompanied by a servant everyone looked at his neighbor				1614.7327525271426
it is not so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven on the contrary we are all free agents alas exclaimed mercÃ©dÃ¨s if it were so if i possessed free will but without the power to render that will efficacious it would drive me to despair monte cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her grief				2311.004649265075
i have just sent away the sentinel that i might remain here without anybody knowing it in order to speak to you without being overheard				10014.698655439865
cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed seized his rapier and returned toward d artagnan but on his way he met athos who during his relief which d artagnan had procured him had recovered his breath and who for fear that d artagnan would kill his enemy wished to resume the fight				475.8297124804673

then the letter that villefort had showed to him recurred to his mind and every line gleamed forth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar				46816.81923635022
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair a head like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him				4.192400802988818
we might say that was his dream				408.2181527677067
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dantÃ¨s if only to prevent your growing weary of me				48.693810593412735

athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst d artagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully				26611.642319517694
what has become of him				9.373688740670161
that is i murmured milady in extreme terror what do you want we wish to judge you according to your crime said athos you shall be free to defend yourself				370.9244706998417
dantÃ¨s uttered blasphemies that made his jailer recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the walls of his prison wreaked his anger upon everything and chiefly upon himself so that the least thing a grain of sand a straw or a breath of air that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury				1129.145878716284

then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud				1210.2800562949535
she is ill				172.95679779782205
the cardinal went up to him and touched his shoulder				140.95820668354608
what do you mean by that you idiot asked d artagnan				1.0344300272607947

the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded				576.9538823616996
in truth my dear captain i have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to mademoiselle de chemerault to whom i promised an abbey				21874.07120176624
and pray asked franz where are these pistols blunderbusses and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage not out of my armory for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting knife				915.4498367265834

how do you mean yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying mademoiselle danglars				8.916758567911806
these words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the pavement of la villette				1162.1170423188298
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him				13.646231484536175
a propos monseigneur continued trÃ©ville addressing the cardinal monsieur de cahusac is quite recovered is he not thank you said the cardinal biting his lips with anger				557.1699190388255

in twenty four hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days afterwards				5905.506383787545
but d artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m bazin and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his friend s valet he simply moved him out of the way with one hand and with the other turned the handle of the door of number five				2618.210662965541
what then how much do you require for my ransom merely the you have about you danglars felt a dreadful spasm dart through his heart				30.191749544354

some of the apartments were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a minute s air showing the scared face of a footman and immediately afterwards the window would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each other in a low voice will there be another funeral today at the procureur s house madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion descending from the cab she approached the door with trembling knees and rang the bell				961.5508402203909
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good well valentine said morrel with a sigh we will not discuss the matter further				533.3682029670895
well my dear viscount said monte cristo i have an infallible remedy to propose to you what is that asked the young man				1.7498633667759733

certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow				941.4930306200488
how madame said the valet in the same carriage as your majesties it is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening but of the king s safety				4089.65735323014

at the sight of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myself for i a simple corsican fisherman had nothing to fear on the contrary that time was most favorable for us smugglers but for my brother a soldier of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was everything to apprehend				9396.640668442007

thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the chimney corner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as no				115.42538741375861
she went to the palais replied the steward				584.2340794402077
but continued morcerf Ã  propos of danglars we have strangely wandered from the subject				154.82810214644678

but could i do with a million retorted the count				9.074230778799198
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est d artagnan whose erudition we are well acquainted with evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m de trÃ©ville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham				202.3575500382291
well did there not happen an event which saved austria				2565.513862875951

he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen				41.39133565218816
from the imperfect means franz had of judging he could only come to one conclusion that the person whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of life				280.25909958288986
he therefore informed m morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of march that is ten or twelve days after napoleon s return				1517.9820579701202
from this view of things then comes the axiom that if you visit to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way advantageous				6409.412915330132

her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost				411.148423498372
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan				1.0698424579475119
maximilian tried to speak but he could articulate nothing he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot				63094.757306036074

ah he is one who fears neither god nor satan they say and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service but such services as these might involve him with the authorities of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said franz				37.60588481414673

a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors concealed in the shadow				1014.6697393292216
i know that i must have been mad senseless to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm but what then				99.52999925929235
we are four of us said d artagnan we must relieve each other in mounting guard over my lord and each of us must watch three hours at a time				112.75043215302787
i would as willingly accuse myself				211.71879206898888
dantÃ¨s took the lamp placed it on a projecting stone above the bed whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted countenance and motionless stiffened body				629.4045104338222
the young girl perceiving that there was something extraordinary looked at him steadfastly				86918.35711545944

adieu paris adieu his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise				950.1961835647289
i was worn out with fatigue				566.1462321642908

look here resumed d artagnan here is monsieur de bragelonne who determined at all risks to aid the arrest of broussel and whom i had great difficulty to prevent defending monsieur de comminges the devil said porthos and his guardian what would he have said to that do you hear interrupted d artagnan become a frondist my friend belong to the fronde and remember that i fill the count s place in everything and he jingled his money				112.93413055135933
my drunkenness is always sad and when i am thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain				482.23820183039805
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination				1511.38280741734
on landing the count turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding morrel				171.10733831685246
besides my friend providence has warned us that we may be on our guard				365.30757493881356
what is this that m de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders				65.34106744379196
they soon tired of the sport				17598.18133212791
eighteen leagues is enough for the first stage the comte de la fere wished me to hasten on replied raoul that i might rejoin the prince on the morning of the fourth day let us push on then to noyon it will be a stage similar to those we traveled from blois to paris				101.47001887723924
you would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald green sea you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning				40209.13774913816
gentlemen your hands are we not pretty good christians egad said d artagnan by heaven				121.26149314103155
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth				6580.65882276951
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside oh no				83.0029122287889
because he had no cash to save				287555.9874428111
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded				718.2834315047131
i was no longer in the house where i had dwelt				3562.6599099438213
i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder				849.5215019612873
the night watch evinced the same terror refused in his turn to accompany athos and only pointed with his hand to the road he was to take				1589.868448781143
but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of milady was increased by his not having killed her brother in law				1749.978164082138
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings				4625.283325856338
then calling planchet he said now my lad you may claim your seven hundred livres but you did not run much risk with such a note as that i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it said planchet				179.99211698796944
almost mad with grief and determined to venture everything in order to see valentine once more and be certain of the misfortune he feared morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden when the sound of a voice still at some distance but which was borne upon the wind reached him				6.866570823272396
but if he be willing to accept my offers will you oppose them you well know edmond that i am no longer a reasoning creature i have no will unless it be the will never to decide				197371.0179233449
i have two things to postpone and what are they first a thrust with the coadjutor whom i met last night at madame de rambouillet s and whom i found particular in his remarks respecting me oh fie a quarrel between priests a duel between allies what can i do friend				1849.6078451040114
dantÃ¨s raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner				218.95640004499398
but the joke appeared an excellent one to the citizens who seeing the conveyance without escort and unarmed would never have believed in the possibility of so great an imprudence				21153.37343527122
dantÃ¨s strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak				8156.736475804597
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee my word of honor sir said athos				4.50648290645468
morcerf s courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow				1273.5247924687326
you say excuse me and you believe that is sufficient				9022.865472017193
no you shall live honored and pure you shall live to triumph over your enemies milady put him from her slowly with her hand while drawing him nearer with her look but felton in his turn embraced her more closely imploring her like a divinity				25752.873662607355
his best known work is the three graces now in the louvre				239.57467092171586
still further monsieur de trÃ©ville gains ten thousand crowns a year he is therefore a great noble				24411.13469665752
benedetto rejoined his associates and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a fool sweet child murmured monte cristo				1.062168717344484

you are discreet so much the better				39.29306051075392
and in proof that he fears nothing that he counts on nothing he will restore monsieur de mazarin to your majesty without conditions				32369.95393256369
danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept watch over him				5.346116354776279
arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband gaspard consider well what you are about to do i have both reflected and decided answered he				59.04838660200187
but he was unable to complete this oath for two days afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers carlini was killed				173.44605397223123
d artagnan picked it up by good luck it had not been extinguished				17600.5310996856
the closet was empty				72.83715002796635
she had still four days before her				14.480196311285692
don t stir whispered monte cristo and put down your hatchet we shall require no arms then he added some words in a low tone for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the count faint as it had been had startled the man who remained in the pose of the old knife grinder				27863.55933160523
but as lord wilmore in the character of the count s enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english				5083.858880384569
this did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghost for he trod so softly that no sound was heard then poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it				24.021336156590756
do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin				34.65318540366372
ten days passed away thus				257.9801570632279
and whatever people may say continued caderousse in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i can not help being more frightened at the idea of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living imbecile exclaimed la carconte				12.307585249758588
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose				363.70001852347445
she loves him devilishly he murmured				156.43728894088503
but allow me to say that you must have been very young then i was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory in what manner could these events concern you				13.433202549981987
she is a foreigner a stranger				5879.785218122344
oh i am a christian cried dantÃ¨s guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him				5.390048902309756
you have seven martlets on your arms give three to your wife and you will still have four that is one more than m de guise had who so nearly became king of france and whose cousin was emperor of germany on my word i think you are right lucien said albert absently				3277.5844577240823
with all my heart				83.96879101275071
madame we are yours body and soul oh sirs said the queen moved even to tears this is the first time for five years i have felt the least approach to joy or hope				1086.9903638252706
no one knows what there is and where is it on the first floor sketch me the plan of that floor as you have done of the ground floor my boy that is very simple andrea took the pen				13821.852300598284
jussac was as was then said a fine blade and had had much practice nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an adversary who active and energetic departed every instant from received rules attacking him on all sides at once and yet parrying like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis				7116.861393330402
oh sir planchet only touched the tips of the count s fingers				4255.228008074625
fortunately i don t know where he is how cried d artagnan you don t know where aramis is formerly replied bazin aramis was his name of perdition				75357.9201950137
in hÃ´tels that do not flourish everything is in confusion and the traveler is a victim to the embarrassments of his host				527.7397818887617
and i for planchet said d artagnan				1.0347032532104992
at the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle down				99.09801295817535
to have to make a false excuse to porthos				117.26336835957763
but today i find you are drawing on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me francs per month				3263.6047531501595
it would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel upon such horses well my dear aramis you may enjoy that pleasure for one of those three horses is yours ah bah				1681.121702816937
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order to talk over and settle the affair but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition real interrupted the count smiling				148.2796782327401
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace				4231.574390418499
no returned she but i feel some emotion on seeing for the first time the man without whose intervention we should have been in tears and desolation				81094.27248577026
i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied d artagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos another i disarmed or wounded i don t remember which wounded said athos it was a phenomenon of skill the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose				430.90614794107745
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brother s pay alone kept her				18.23995071489067
on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him				15.552155960162949
then that is agreed said the king and that is all i had to say to you but on what day will this ball take place asked anne of austria				45.59936709712915
wife wife cried he in a hoarse voice come here diamond exclaimed la carconte rising and descending to the chamber with a tolerably firm step what diamond are you talking about why did you not hear all we said inquired caderousse				29.033938057326285
has not some sage said nothing too much				175.00623900687268
after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step so that the table alone separated them the unknown took off his mask				1023.0366057883033
that brave and unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must run head foremost like a ram				83249.34715216441
bonacieux prophesied				14.736482380889484
are you looking for anything mr procureur asked benedetto with his most ingratiating smile				69.86770245769266
oh heavens continued olivain in despair what would the count say if he only saw you now the count would do as i do replied raoul urging his horse vigorously forward				648.8986039302711
i am mistaken monsieur de mazarin will not come to visit the comte de la fere but the comte de la fere will be sent for to visit him no no no said comminges who made a point of having the facts appear exactly as they were i clearly understood what the cardinal said to me				13.710783762434424
they must disappear broken scattered annihilated				9982.459536258333
why count exclaimed eugÃ©nie what has happened to your ward				17866.875977817876
as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table				255.8045219303
no no look look the recommendation was needless				48231.78016251623
you have been here a very long time john said he				13.724271358732237
hey friend cried the duke				10.23529847138764
i don t need the quarter of such a sum i who am still only in the guards and by selling my saddles i shall procure it				5.028003651343099
but then your word is given yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not				47.8932780941679
i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express surely so trifling a circumstance can not deserve a place in your remembrance				4186.572907289647
but one thing i can tell you of which i do not think you are aware that is that i have always been opposed to this marriage and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation noirtier regarded his daughter in law with the look of a man desiring an explanation				6826.390205468227
what after the varied relations i have had the happiness to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a thing				2568.3890804932594
and how proceed it is now eleven answered grimaud				54.698500719163654
i give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter that is true answered the marquis				7386.52393399794
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat				1304.0824470273092
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of eugÃ©nie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him				3.2484708894435577
you marry a money bag label it is true well but what does that matter				1335.5847383618582
you aramis why the devil did you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a cassock				4040.631632471326
sir said d artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers well that is scarcely the question				154.94420294429102
the queen was as we have said of great beauty				1877.420281909151
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence				52603.94210830551
well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those				150375.79130196664
you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse				87.59617322279865
and now said athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign				83196.32967495712
he went with groslow to the captain s berth a sort of temporary cabin of planks for the chief apartment had been given up by captain rogers to the passengers who were to be accommodated at the other end of the boat				4658.280166746798
all minds were uneasy most were foreboding many of the people used threatening language				2455.001015608758
adieu i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him go straight to his box that will be the simplest plan but i have never been presented presented to whom to the beautiful greek you say she is only a slave while you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess				549.7504536626877
but lose no time we have lost too much already that is true				193.08724027371173
my lord cried the gascon don t threaten				10795.980096688763

i have killed two which has made people hold their tongues but has not made me their friend				143.00644101746008

he questioned me concerning captain leclere s death and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris				65.42031668222366
no thank you do you wish anything leave me to pray the count withdrew without opposition but it was only to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of morrel who at length arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back				146.45639140269805
i shall work doctor when i work i forget everything and indeed no sooner had the doctor left the room than he was again absorbed in work				786.8430745191047
at the first glance d artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy				29035.920667987604
thou man of noble heart woe is me				115.82478014928928
oh i will be revenged i believed that madame loved him i love him				29.538676257936363

grimaud followed athos				4.156491842981816
ah said morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted				8724.069510048392

my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations				4583.9264026755145
he resolved then to defend the door bravely and as betrayed by the mistress of the inn he could not say that aramis was absent he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference which had commenced with the morning and would not as bazin said terminate before night				312.80342283295204
wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wishes				10864.665059679115

come be frank gentlemen you have settled accounts with somebody				4281.491598469977

now said d artagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure of it i hope the accident has been of no consequence they don t yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured at this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper				4039.4603544968
athos had desired blaisois to try to speak to aramis himself				60.56197732155538
i was uneasy about him why because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me				19.617285762038
bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed				686.3837819270905
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the red tinted horizon				704.9604545301879
i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at rome i who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage				10714.325205695868

i have not forgotten all i owe thee				5499.269207494984
the cardinal looked then with great impatience for the news from england which would announce to him that buckingham would not come				92.7137856257466
the queen and her minister more especially the latter had reason to feel anxious				2903.1060408900917
at the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only francs left				88.39798661828753
danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated were they alone there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named caderousse but he was very drunk				4630.26604252514
everything was as athos had foreseen				170.6171942123971
one of her conditions was that she should come and see me twice a week for as i had the honor to tell you my wife loves me dearly my wife then came and confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great fears truly yes				708.2955446698438
many people have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial				1523.1786239304786
i take that god to witness at whose feet i have prostrated myself daily for the last ten years that i would have sacrificed my life to you and with my life the projects that were indissolubly linked with it				7.80646800481714
a night is soon passed and tomorrow to the wheel to the gallows				58867.00590305086
a newly born infant repeated debray this affair becomes serious well said chÃ¢teau renaud i was not wrong just now then when i said that houses had souls and faces like men and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters				174.4087615846782
yes kill them cried d artagnan i see fresh tracks tis not a quarter of an hour since they passed this place in fact the road was trodden by horses feet visible even in the approaching gloom of evening				360.9629598096655
the bolts were drawn the door groaned upon its hinges				567.954874521018
meantime he was going to try to find out milady				271.04204082405704
must i always be the same said he and shall i never succeed in overcoming the old leaven				85348.96755880663
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air				667.1195498311789
but yet continued the king undoubtedly my haste accuses you wrongfully without doubt the rioters are in prison and you come to tell me justice is done sire replied m de trÃ©ville calmly on the contrary i come to demand it of you and against whom cried the king				16.42237968504688
in the first place light me a torch ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted apartment				202.1618632626489
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience				1298.2304691898366
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title				9207.628369167891
d artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale				11834.301221380958
we will keep on the frontiers for instance and at the first alarm we can leave france and what can we do there wait but if they come my brother s carriage will be here first if i should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes for you at dinner or supper for instance do one thing what is that tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together as possible you ask her permission to share my repast will she permit it what inconvenience can it be oh delightful				2747.9660391029656

well then off to the nearest goldsmith s and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him				19.481972960631637
this belief was changed into certainty when franz saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin				12352.28724706249
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his hand				23.469425648333637
with two companions he said				2.8060234030094113
on arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a rampart one of the guardsmen fell				337.0256224378689
and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him				8.800344418836454
what do you want of me he asked				11.759614189872988
m de villefort followed them				12.139869165949538
has mankind treated me as a brother				304.29962049264157
never had anne of austria appeared to him so beautiful amid balls fÃªtes or carousals as she appeared to him at this moment dressed in a simple robe of white satin and accompanied by donna estafania the only one of her spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of richelieu				385.1589848051432
the story interests you does it not sir inquired caderousse				30.87763863828996
well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it i am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the duke of buckingham to him whom you allowed to be assassinated to the duchess de chevreuse whom you suffered to be exiled to the duc de beaufort whom you imprisoned but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which i stand to you anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride				3743.932924592906
i am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard				728.501778192765
now gentlemen said he conduct me where you will turning back again he said i thought i saw winter move if he still lives by all you hold most sacred do not abandon him never fear king charles said mordaunt the bullet pierced his heart do not breathe a word nor make the least sign to me or porthos said d artagnan to athos and aramis that you recognize this man for milady is not dead her soul lives in the body of this demon the detachment now moved toward the town with the royal captive but on the road an aide de camp from cromwell sent orders that colonel tomlison should conduct him to holdenby castle				3266.58781019158
you wish to ask for liberty and i give it you oh my lord answered d artagnan you are too good as to our liberty we have that we want to ask something else of you you have your liberty repeated mazarin in terror				174.10273524206835
besides on pressing occasions in extreme difficulties d artagnan would become the preserver of his friends				73.24254823528788
did i tell you that i wouldn t serve any other				230.92420912226288
what is it then mazarin sank into a chair with the deepest melancholy painted on his countenance				126.76992736217872
i should make an excellent gambler if i were not too hot headed but i was hot headed just as if i had been drinking				15967.601945972145
ah ah said porthos it appears we are feasting i hope said aramis there are no women at your dinner is there any drinkable wine in your tavern asked athos				4.477249441695749
and what does he say asked porthos in a self sufficient tone				275.3074437925253
yes looked the old man				1.7897368933832156
the contract was read during a profound silence				353.3406459466675
i am the most wretched of men				283.91880981183465
this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe franz remained a moment silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the half kindness half cruelty with which his host related the brief narrative				2929.6070404163643
to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife				359.3205467853026
and how did he treat you with more of mildness than severity did you tell him your whole story i did and did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination he did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought me into this scrape				65991.20058313257
he will be condemned will he not asked debray of beauchamp				146.44109815019326
at the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed				154424.1424259699
not yet replied porthos				11.706642792537119
oh my dear d artagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me				18.53420844502129
on the contrary let us speak about it for it was agreed among us once for all that we should always hold together though engaged on opposing sides yes added athos i now ask you d artagnan what side you are on				124.50876390794555
porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar				26184.629477846705
he hurt my shoulder				276.88305633040187
marry forsooth people don t die of hunger here and aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window				46.43736830285517
fourteen years he muttered				22.160542255738644
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majesty s voice and await the order of their captain have they not heard that of their colonel				9370.116776978413
felton as pale as death remained some instants with his ear bent and listening then when the sound was quite extinct he breathed like a man awaking from a dream and rushed out of the apartment				136.1467033588047
she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy days				529.4123491819986
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me hark said morrel				28.374096314573205
fortunately the storm began to subside but still the sea was disturbed				1329.410718898939
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land				690.0954686793851
he thought that voice more feeble than usual				4576.579311331091
the shade of richelieu was mazarin				308.07047134659024
now said the count let us follow him franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley				6872.710143354339
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into truly athos interrupted d artagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of				149.28802516709874
your profession first i was a forger answered andrea as calmly as possible then i became a thief and lately have become an assassin a murmur or rather storm of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly				2645.5274139989997
cambalet his niece while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke all things which appeared to d artagnan monstrous impossibilities				579.596599849546
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan				24732.78031198765
he confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade the same who was killed to carry off a young woman who was to leave paris by the barriÃ¨re de la villette but having stopped to drink at a cabaret they had missed the carriage by ten minutes				821.8687849721098
caderousse entered hastily				60.506585400594815
there in the twentieth chapter of the life of pope alexander vi were the following lines which i can never forget the great wars of romagna had ended cÃ¦sar borgia who had completed his conquest had need of money to purchase all italy				1278.9756877894151
the smugglers dantÃ¨s had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast				11850.54172221974
the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him much more so would be that of the king				85.93099725558206
louvieres recognized him and bowed				378.3898475464135
we can not say but only relate the fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly				9930.795290459322
athos do you know any inn in the whole town where one can find white sheets roast beef reasonably cooked and wine which is not made of hops and gin i think i know what you want replied athos				4.765182336080489
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped				4939.221077560793
now chevalier he added turning to aramis let us go				181.80258317638638
maximilian said valentine maximilian come back i entreat you he drew near with his sweet smile and but for his paleness one might have thought him in his usual happy mood				3501.0129138244597
come gentlemen cried harrison regardless of his illustrious captive let us be off where do we sleep colonel at thirsk replied harrison				6151.528296564218
the sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembrances				14390.707421271158
yes said he i made a vow to our lady of the grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if i were saved in a moment of danger but today the vow expires now what are we to do with you said the captain				119.49689481233669
whilst planchet was standing on the steps before the house he heard a voice say well where is this gentleman and why do they not bring him here this voice the sound of which reached d artagnan reawakened in his heart a thousand sentiments a thousand recollections that he had forgotten				164.60018952948627
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil				319.13722583030693
one must take the world as one finds it				10.135871938740287
athos still within the inclosure of the window watched this scene with a smile of disdain on his lips				33.24693281842967
do you hear not a single creature				28378.78074195609
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were				533.92140259084
danglars observed that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word				119.01529952770275
bonacieux dead and d artagnan in a swoon				11308.016883993982
he sat all night on his stool starting at the least noise and when the first rays of the sun penetrated into his chamber the dawn itself appeared to him to have taken funereal tints				8596.526475907162
athos arrested				48.45346197048522
then who loads his pistol his servant a nubian a negro it is he then do you know this gentleman yes and i am come to look for him he is a friend of mine oh that is quite another thing then				63.432645216155294

presently the army came in sight of lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault				10359.664042681803
when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m noirtier s eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son				129.99295777349107
what a noise about a musketeer				705.5227236811719
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert				3050.700764833924
what are you doing asked milady with surprise				250.59283737349074
had his majesty asked he any intention of holding this hunting party yesterday no your excellency replied the valet de chambre the master of the hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag				25418.883060249562
it was now one o clock in the morning and the coadjutor returned home				235.63075170483742
madame resumed athos two of my friends named d artagnan and monsieur du vallon sent to england by the cardinal suddenly disappeared when they set foot on the shores of france no one knows what has become of them well said the queen				9.21328204034559

come calm yourself and reckon them up m				78.60634033806606
i met him on the boulevard on my way here said beauchamp				48.51100298919886
now then what had i better do return instantly				1231.7179252888598
what do you want with a notary again repeated villefort				26.073570937259987
well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel				638.980028421649
consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret				2899.39293256057
go to the count of monte cristo avenue des champs Ã©lysÃ©es on the of may at seven o clock in the evening and demand of him your father				74.37342748255196

yes sire in solitary confinement in a dungeon like the lowest criminal the devil murmured the king what must be done sign an order for his release and all will be said replied the cardinal				15.27269493658855
and yet frightful though this spot may be it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered it is so rare for them to leave the lions den for any other place than the barrier saint jacques the galleys				10057.04048007465
eight days after i was back again madame				210.4217691793406
di quÃ  said one of the men descending a little path leading out of the appian way				357.7405307080637
i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness				4036.5143971170037
and what has procured me so flattering a distinction what				377.5674389328833
the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like turks or even tailors				8478.768641433891
in the service of the four friends grimaud had had so frequent occasion to make lint and bandages that he had become something of a surgeon				5947.284694948222
in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years for change of air will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty				957.0424353648866
he followed m d Ã©pinay saw him enter afterwards go out and then re enter with albert and chÃ¢teau renaud				6.6810230736649645

do you not comprehend no the chÃ¢teau d if has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the sea after fastening a thirty six pound cannon ball to their feet well observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension				1273.8260310061762
that name written in her hand you see then said athos there is a god in heaven still chapter lxiv				50.46604074801042
do you think then that any harm can have happened to him asked aramis				17.124494946017194
the cardinal being left alone reflected for an instant and then rang the bell a third time				92.55137016817868
you have often heard me speak of them have you not my friend yes but i confess i always thought you jested with such things				311.57931207439714
lake maggiore				1.1999825200074814
grimaud sprang up				78.30511051539325
i repeat my words aramis and then if you desire it and if they desire it let us separate forever from our old friends there was a solemn though momentary silence which was broken by aramis				181.67857177603125
pray don t heed him sir he only barks he never bites				17982.690170450835
there were no questions				560.2133213703709
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house				114.5430327668043
i must confess that i was mistaken				278.0110194856857
he delayed presenting himself at morrel s but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him				3.1550379532420068
you do not understand me gentlemen said d artagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun				291.98613378028404
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la rÃ©serve				362.68637316280444
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs ah caderousse said andrea how covetous you are				67.09634361638578
then continued he there is a horse for my lackey and my valise				13768.189219693732
he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september				217.2521570396032
close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly count andrea cavalcanti the dutiful son whom we also know				548.3589359563405
i have another commission for you m bertuccio said he i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandy for instance between le havre and boulogne				599.7978111658518
they were his friends and not mine				827.4056621854556
oh pray do for heaven s sake tell us all about is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving				870.9484135569753
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced				4074.80512030739
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you can all three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools				86164.511459563
athos was pale and trembled in every limb				31699.028998375943
ten minutes afterward mazarin entered the court of that chateau which his predecessor had built for him at rueil as he alighted comminges approached him				6.050225585254284
from twelve to two o clock danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker				1738.3090111586932
except that which i ask of you dear love but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness i can not wait till tomorrow silence				611.5551472234473

he promised to be back by eight o clock and eight is striking				2880.724049125735
blaisois obeyed				8.795410916703
the officer opened the door which was locked and without speaking a word answered dantÃ¨s question for he saw between the ranks of the soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port				458.2743898188981
well sir said the abbÃ© you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon unfortunately edmond is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the abbÃ©				17.357255127757153
on reaching her room eugÃ©nie locked her door while louise fell on a chair				138.1742312718557
i will bless you i i am dying cried mordaunt come to me				6.2346858497680175
the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles				1014.4505869968557
my friend said athos he has given me news of raoul and now gentlemen said planchet who had not heard what they were saying what do you intend to do re enter paris if you will let us my good planchet let you sir				54.33871050691322
villefort looked disdainfully at morrel and replied coldly you are aware monsieur that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life and the best seaman in the merchant service and yet be politically speaking a great criminal				17421.809748903863
one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him				15.44482768961148
ah i am an unfortunate king monsieur de trÃ©ville				17.61578954881907
how is that my friend why thus it is replied dantÃ¨s				88.33486630025259
and madame de villefort have just left this room have they not yes and it was they who told you something which made you angry				3797.90419576758
well said he i will ask you the same question which charles ix				4559.184739181948
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself hear me count replied d artagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts i wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur d herblay				36.174686068473626
adieu adieu dearest edmond cried mercÃ©dÃ¨s stretching out her arms to him from the balcony				2011.592193865883
an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you can not grudge it to me debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie				7874.387611267274
help me here i am sir said athos leaning and stretching out his arm to mordaunt with that air of dignity and nobility of soul habitual to him here i am take my hand and jump into our boat mordaunt made a last effort rose seized the hand thus extended to him and grasped it with the vehemence of despair				285.2288105710078
they drew near to the sloop				862.8830606670782
indeed said athos				3.6873697595705557
did i not see you the other day smile on the duke of orleans				1264.719682260948
and whose horses are these cried d artagnan				1.0547280304197786
it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier				7002.7303687348385
only that our enemies have escaped they have cut the cord and gone off with the boat mordaunt bounded with one step to the cabin and kicked open the door				14.529690708947573
well just as you like my prince there s liberty for all the world				84.62950516406109
besides what would the sailors say				355.63560045573706
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbÃ© in a monk s dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages				28209.245341506445
that is a serious thing monte cristo who pretended not to be listening heard however every word that was said				109.78490524075191
an instant afterward the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends				202.15800736788668
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve o clock an hour previous to that time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests consisting of the favored part of the crew of the pharaon and other personal friends of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest costumes in order to do greater honor to the occasion				574.3952438988489
i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man				4.342489514255492
you are alone one alone shall answer you you have a sword by your side i have one in my cane you have no witness one of these gentlemen will serve you				10.866179470741415
i still assist at executions but no longer strike the blow myself no indeed you have then a repugnance to your profession so long as i struck in the name of the law and of justice my profession allowed me to sleep quietly sheltered as i was by justice and law but since that terrible night when i became an instrument of private vengeance and when with personal hatred i raised the sword over one of god s creatures since that day the executioner paused and shook his head with an expression of despair				281.37545670178406
how do you mean the receipt of m de monte cristo is as good as money take it to rothschild s or lafitte s and they will take it off your hands at once what though payable at rome certainly it will only cost you a discount of or francs the receiver started back				276.8302501146611
they had not long to wait for an answer				444.4201001308619
my credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes and will you go asked kitty				351.1517451666668
yes yes continued m de trÃ©ville growing warmer as he spoke and his majesty was right for upon my honor it is true that the musketeers make but a miserable figure at court				560.972218498853
well that is not impossible				135.95662113989675
enter gentlemen and be kind enough to wait for me i shall not be more than half an hour and while the three musketeers entered the ground floor room the cardinal without asking further information ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him				8.417889745736934
athos was then sent to the cardinal but unfortunately the cardinal was at the louvre with the king				96.90031648923664
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law				1098.3779450432717
you had better see him for his madness is amusing i will see them both returned the inspector i must conscientiously perform my duty this was the inspector s first visit he wished to display his authority				1386.395179216298
milady let her head sink between her two hands and tried to recall her ideas whirling in a mortal vertigo				19153.8507144924
what say you to that crime of which i have the proof she was my mother on our return to france she had a young woman who was attached to one of her opponents poisoned in the convent of the augustines at bethune				1989.3532049004243
i have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write they then separated				3729.7137291470217
when they were gone morrel ventured out from under the trees and the moon shone upon his face which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost				19899.19661867995
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death				366.4649958569128
was not faria s fate the better after all to solve the problem of life at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering				5538.960623470651
mazarin disappeared as they rose from table				419.3781671818753
in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord				22097.854844956237
and you monsieur du vallon yes you sir				29.082149842036653
bonacieux pardon me for interrupting you but what do you advise me to do				93.49345070817614
the boat moved off toward the left hand shore of the lys bearing the guilty woman and the executioner all the others remained on the right hand bank where they fell on their knees				458.40246175443895
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition				31306.457530813663
corbleu i am more your friend than you think for after our very first encounter i could by saying a word to the cardinal have had your throat cut they this time embraced heartily and without retaining any malice				139519.90028108127
our athos who was as virtuous as scipio				34648.46320662771
planchet went down into the yard and wished to saddle the horses but the horses were all used up				319.83343067017034
like everything else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous				18603.929864510304
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had disappeared				267.8855827764278
he had only been back an hour or two he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement or else at least to the first relay				12194.868911384265
they had only halberds before now they have muskets				3721.350102241261
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it although i have repeated more than once and affirmed on my honor that i was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me and although i still declare that it is impossible for anyone but you to recognize the count of morcerf under the name of fernand i maintain my original resolution very well my dear sir then i consent to cut throats with you				69.06669367486269
he told me to watch you and why so				10.107497578785672
the wife of athos chapter xxviii				21.149589226704137
as for the sailors although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishing boats with their white sails were alone visible				500.418408166362
come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife s room nothing is changed here he then closed the door of the landing				14905.415826423892
if you will give at each of these relays your address in paris the four horses will follow you thither				7039.396529382481
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m de villefort				4.959226663844939
nothing but the recollection of his oath gave him strength to proceed				2033.6220395908138
she corrupted this man she placed the poniard in his hand she made him kill the duke				79.93464581337723
he saw the map which monte cristo had been examining when he entered and said you seem geographically engaged sir				819.996083774036
you talk like a noodle my friend said caderousse and here is danglars who is a wide awake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong				1425.2936212686902
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d artagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood				1566.342743621312
then you were about to tell me all the isolation of your life the griefs of your heart				44.96043114000556
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers				2461.861142743085
in a few minutes laporte was at the lodge in two words d artagnan informed him where mme				26.214916300945386
he rose in his turn and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the carriage was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was master of				564.6846712202605
ask me to lend you half a million and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my honor you would annoy me less				1612.4075952558917
what company company of trÃ©ville advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour the three companions advanced rather humbly for all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves leaving athos the post of speaker				21502.151511662647
determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance				5270.218384036536
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption				17489.863346758026
moderato he cried as they descended				7932.764800349979
well and what then said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger mercÃ©dÃ¨s is not accountable to any person is she				2524.820492725447
the latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl absorbed by her affection and he also like morrel followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the lover				1140.0059896699563
the pates were excellent the wine delicious				1095.0185395258989
you are safe you are free mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a miracle				12172.385741650623
as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre				2331.697019275109
we will travel on horseback as far as our horses can go and afterward we can take the post				4234.238687735582
the whole army talked of this expedition for a day and monsieur paid him his compliments upon it				8.594074713300074
hardly had the door closed when villefort threw himself half fainting into a chair				153.64278016197127
he had his musketeers therefore as louis xiii				1.4787296084730701
he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder				319.07210093928586
justify yourself if you can				168.71566394329724
is it about sending me to the bastile				360.45298296630165
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it you don t mention those who aided and abetted the deed said caderousse				28.547848478395185

why then have you laid it aside because remembering the scene at armentieres i thought i should find four axes for one as i was to meet four executioners sir replied d artagnan in the calmest manner possible you are very young i shall therefore overlook your frivolous remarks				24304.117748439545
he resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance				3161.1977942371655
was faria deceived as to his treasure or was all the world deceived as to faria				271.96718601631756
the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies				2762.2687198563017
this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen s coachmen on a cold night and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door				14.865134111795006
at the branching off of the road toward paris aramis who had followed in the cardinal s suite turned back				137.06698677553962
which whichever of the three you like i have no preference and the rich caparison is that mine too without doubt you laugh d artagnan no i have left off laughing now that you speak french what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silver are they all for me for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos peste they are three superb animals i am glad they please you why it must have been the king who made you such a present certainly it was not the cardinal but don t trouble yourself whence they come think only that one of the three is your property i choose that which the red headed boy is leading it is yours good heaven				579.6397156716556
what is the matter said the count				7.28080832685626
i can not tell you i don t know him how				299.9320835293498
consider said aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven				125.73296440966574
the house ali had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to monte cristo was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs Ã©lysÃ©es				139.50757971101862
what cried d artagnan				1.0649744304738595
you will perhaps smile at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this man i have involuntarily entertained the idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated from him				8.034166655474674
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word				146.50179174027932
that devil porthos is a man of prodigious strength still if athos joins us well we shall be three of us to laugh at aramis that little coxcomb with his too good luck at villars cotterets he wrote to the cardinal my lord i have already one man to offer to your eminence and he is well worth twenty men				357.5568589304078
i never meddle in intrigues and if i occasionally become a confidant of the intrigues of others i am sure your eminence will approve of my keeping them secret mazarin shook his head				15.12103566051485
i will show you the way and he went in first				527.6708354059299
did you see him they all asked				228.5708303190975
i would not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces and what will she do now asked the young man				1.738844908206003

raoul had offered some opposition at first but d artagnan made use of the comte de la fere s name and after paying a visit to madame de chevreuse raoul started to rejoin the army				376.9211155588069
under this head also bragelonne had much more to hear than to tell				21154.14003946198
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture				291.23276010743257
athos wished to restrain him but it was too late				574.9101194618233
athos glanced at aramis				43.81916411419904
non capisco do not understand was the reply				405.95169269238835
franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent				898.0409971755093
ha ha ha she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her arms stiffened and twisted her head fell back on her chair and she remained motionless				363.32110749614304
who can tell whether mazarin may not take advantage of this rendezvous to seize us what				388.9426234471955
now since d artagnan did not constitute a body of horsemen since he was alone since he was not going away from rueil and was going to saint germain no one paid any attention to him and his journey was not obstructed in any way				752.7402155974354

this house in past years did ours a great service and has i know not for what reason always denied having rendered us this service i shall be at your orders said monte cristo bowing				101.92507802523535
it was her husband who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag and was crying thieves oh my god cried mme				22.091257499190096
he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert				196.14746874525372
would it be impertinent signor sinbad said franz to ask you the particulars of this kindness oh they are simple enough replied the host				74.82211859900491
if you go on so his eminence will be forced to renew his company in three weeks and i to put the edicts in force in all their rigor				21209.307480724245
only think what the poor fellow may even now be suffering villefort shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back				155.44964750069278
the devil take you said aramis				19.214150095400683
have you seen anything they asked				24.389642490325127
d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week				1461.5550357090558
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition too				1159.3717527413407
judge for yourself replied he				8.815287637979402
an instant afterwards the door opened she felt two arms encircle her and a mouth pressed her forehead				410.85719513290826
was it from london you brought that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger				299.1125635230703
then everything was still excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied				13317.65928150852
when he had mounted his phaeton monte cristo turned and seeing bertuccio what news said he				19.975096684973984
well yes you are right that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly				45893.52694599403

however he continued all the same but with increasing warmth yes i can very well understand that after having inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you to be my heir likewise but know beforehand if you kill me or cause me to be killed my precautions are taken				78.61987265779094
so much the better				8.166653942815488
the total amount was found to be as m noirtier had stated				6507.441435362273
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent				7481.288336064244
the marines were removed				79.13115174412086
oh ungrateful girl that i am cried valentine sobbing i will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom i had nearly forgotten no said maximilian you shall not leave him				9.98828414664609
between people like us threats are out of place everything should be amicably arranged				11136.333928613383
yes a fine house standing alone between a courtyard and a garden you must know it possibly but it is not the exterior i care for it is the interior				639.2223024296507
through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressing room the count could see into the street				312.8862155316371
the king called the cardinal				55.6162559948533
this done he impatiently awaited the return of his companions				548.5349388334324
these gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water they ve allowed him to walk over the border d artagnan began to smile				927.4650930369163
bring it to me or rather no no i may be found here therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along				3299.034459384892
a young man does not require luxuries besides i know what travelling is with a post chaise and valet de chambre any way mother well be it so				47.72479611334587
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel				565.488992465584
what line would you advise me to study the one that is most in use just at this time the spanish one you mean i suppose yes should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain to you no said monte cristo since as i told you before i do not wish to comprehend it				5.834938944149469
see said d avrigny to villefort nature knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow				1329.0969692757508
sure of being killed by athos it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos				61.05670697052477
yes said the man thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking impudently at the youth i have taken the whim into my head do you understand master benedetto at this name no doubt the young man reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying this man is right i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late the surprised groom retired				529.2109376074764
we shall wait for you d artagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear him				7.064398489356069
towards the evening of the third day				217.01795396422867
the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground				28.3597177566369
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt				2147.033873903725
and as the man approached d artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern				59442.08744163147
we may say that he is not equal to his mother when we put foot in france if we are not poisoned or killed before then meanwhile let us dine suggested porthos				9.58035000790137
ah said andrea deeply affected				315.4680494809473
thou hast prospered and grown stout and d artagnan could not restrain his astonishment at the change good fortune had produced on the once famished one				197.62206600149773
i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor				452.05026215496196
the time for wine came				110.14051439451721
he forgot all that was dark in the past and that was cloudy in the future				904.5252678661435
this brought them by the end of the repast to swallowing a drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale topaz				5808.9952204154615
i read the advertisement in one of the papers and was tempted by the false title a country house it is not yet too late cried bertuccio eagerly and if your excellency will intrust me with the commission i will find you a better at enghien at fontenay aux roses or at bellevue oh no returned monte cristo negligently since i have this i will keep it and you are quite right said the notary who feared to lose his fee				17463.329517855058
but as m de toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemy s camp for a fresh assault the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action				672.0470096056087
when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast the materialist and the scoffer great city murmured he inclining his head and joining his hands as if in prayer less than six months have elapsed since first i entered thy gates				5168.593660510346
but the paper nowhere identifies this fernand with your father no but the connection will be seen by others and therefore i will have the article contradicted at the words i will beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to albert s countenance and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few moments				3327.085042998763
then i renewed the search				279.9751292582515
this evening said the governor when the task was ended				1875.4831225737526
they want to arrest master broussel he cried the guards are in the carriage and the officer is upstairs the crowd began to murmur and approached the house				88.48228752762695
again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages nay indeed your excellency i am not condemning you for this monsieur baptistin but let your profits end here				638.2717137053972
stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of despair				225.51495123760193
that was the question the three musketeers put to one another				146.84883504735672
yes i have replied franz i am curious to know what work you were perusing with so much attention as we entered cÃ¦sar s commentaries said the bandit it is my favorite work well are you coming asked albert				40.54722894813175
sleep well your last night as citizen i am to be a soldier then said the young man				1.7623463931623584
i beg you will remove your bandage it may be supposed then franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty eight to forty years of age dressed in a tunisian costume that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with gold like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle				4304.315773037087
he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink				1140.515997907005
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient means of vengeance of which we have just spoken				1413.6692668671783
he is not curious thought d artagnan				1.0484058838223707
he tried it on his left hand it fit his finger as if made for it				6.01030149378088
whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazin s house				176.23498672783575
milady asked some questions about the carriage				198.28649035220803
a complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour good my friend said d artagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing i do not think it i am certain of it quick quick d artagnan				1.0689253792419744
oh how distinctly i remember that kiss it was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my forehead				415.5981782878626
ah cursed gascon that i am i get from one hobble into another				181.28724801858036
the moment for my escape is fixed seven o clock				2.7467926235137665
a great poet				23.707727462772564
it was at the corner of two streets and had in the rear bordering on the side street stables and a sort of garden				1229.034410521655
the matter was no longer doubtful				3758.199161229407
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti oh do not confound the two eugÃ©nie hold your tongue				369.0381831161997
and then continued mme				13.805759093023573
i beg you to understand sir i will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me this threat brought no reply				610.0528596155676
toward the town of louvres was the reply				860.5224881653586
no replied athos with a singular smile				96.00888384457119
was i not nearly your husband and with this raillery andrea went out leaving the two girls a prey to their own feelings of shame and to the comments of the crowd				204.33480422508626
this example was imitated by the rest until the room filled silently as if these men had been the humblest most devoted courtiers				7815.307042448983
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused				7911.587654637516
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge s door and which merits a particular description				5674.521988303504
she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves that immense breaking of the ocean with her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans thou leavest thy servants lord to see if they be strong but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on these verses were not excellent very far from it but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry				9924.518171592033
signed el kobbir that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it near the merchant s signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor				442.99809243487243
and she began the same religious chant which had so strongly excited felton the evening before				564.8748026415917
monsieur said albert with affectionate courtesy the count of chÃ¢teau renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me you are his friend be ours also well said interrupted chÃ¢teau renaud and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me what has he done asked albert				35.87878998616989
kitty who was to set out that evening for tours was waiting in the next chamber				71.18395003366597
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized				1616.1069537506153
i did not even know that you were the person i was sent to fetch impossible you a favorite of the minister a favorite				22816.04264978013
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty				966.0100042460291
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance				43054.88023615048
is she not free to love whomsoever she will oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing				2687.8060910717672
the conversation took a cheerful turn				330.66175428861936
thirty thousand crowns in alms is not given as you have done for the last six months out of pure christian charity that would be too grand				178915.23670229703
oh dear no your excellency				299.24038550120315
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect no not perfect was the count s reply only impenetrable that s all				203.0642312041068
chÃ¢teau renaud was at his post apprised by beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from albert				262.0152654608232
in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose				34887.52671372169
porthos rested his chin on his hands placed his elbows on the table and looked at d artagnan with an expression of confidence which imparted to that colossus an admirable appearance of good fellowship				6926.798440084358
we on our side do the same				161.57285720324
in that hotel				97.50448309335086
albert followed him with the count				68.99049453473098
i will introduce you to them but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars				27.139735976741992
you didn t know king charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side				458.9207970711056
louis xviii				9.864157829998577
the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantÃ¨s forehead large drops of perspiration				320.46238315060145
bernouin seeing that his master did not return and hearing the stroke of midnight had made an examination of the orangery				17792.569703365778
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp				70647.41310844495
this last proof instead of giving him fresh strength deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the ground passed his hand over his brow and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a desire to be assured that no one was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint				2464.0538027400266
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet				8265.96098922654
what s your pleasure gentlemen replied the peasant with a purity of accent peculiar to the people of that district and which might have put to shame the cultured denizens of the sorbonne and the rue de l universite				753.2956921302774
athos alone remained unmoved as if no danger hovered over him and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere				37750.12148351387
hardly had he read the letter when his wife entered				139.4809732893425
the cardinal is not the man to forget a mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier and the mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young gascon of my acquaintance do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself and knows that i have been to london the devil				474.34067762237424
he launched into a eulogy of his eminence and said that he should not have failed to enter into the guards of the cardinal instead of the king s guards if he had happened to know m de cavois instead of m de trÃ©ville				31.71241335839448
my god silence both remained suspended motionless and breathless within twenty paces of the ground while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and talking				1819.8863466171097
by degrees everyone awoke				288.62182402240296
milady then perceived with terror that the uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed				3355.246136393889
i can just suit you ah said porthos brightening that s well as regards my horse but i must have the appointments complete as they include objects which a musketeer alone can purchase and which will not amount besides to more than three hundred livres three hundred livres				451.1815516338973
i have placed reliance upon you my friend				34.184672869274834
i know these lovers				2446.5332264869335
i forgot that my songs are out of place in this castle				1727.5404058650306
with his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter				44275.63193102791
you must set out for boulogne				1891.033832178547
from time to time chills ran through his whole body and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice				318.36753375888816
stop a minute answered caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night				308.9127669521887
nobody knew				100.80897278513235
there crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to one another but more frequently alone watching the door which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society				4392.766043882411
oh take it take it said the count haydÃ©e is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know ali left the room				55.96824996124284
the doctors anxious for my lungs had prescribed the air of naples				414.0335850994553
aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of st augustine which he was forced to write in latin for the following week and which preoccupied him a good deal				2694.446798223292
look gentlemen all these words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth that every eye was fixed on the count s forehead and he himself passed his hand across it as if he felt ali s blood still lingering there				152.9917599981206
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger				1236.58000756642
this was now all changed				500.0391491903797
haydÃ©e would it please you not to leave me i am young gently replied haydÃ©e i love the life you have made so sweet to me and i should be sorry to die you mean then that if i leave you haydÃ©e i should die yes my lord do you then love me oh valentine he asks if i love him				24.071965747605088
it was indeed peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the door and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chick peas stewed with bacon				2439.135370360064
his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de mÃ©rÃ© or a vitry				439.78252612385927
porthos received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such demonstrations only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his hat gracefully and waved it to her as a sign of adieu				10416.797503544323
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room				79.55280179617478
porthos followed chatting with aramis				115.25593640809447
the king				28.040258768285888
bonacieux expected him				5.4148443430183555
a little troop of men on horseback were waiting on the edge of the stream ready to embark				5879.179650092633
what says monsieur the abbÃ©				31.145059055547964
speak loud very loud for they will be listening at the door				17.376492285338134
adieu madame				11.612987905546541
that m danglars speculates whereas he never does truly madame i recollect m debray told me apropos what has become of him				10.556929156045976
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared				214.48573174156473
ah that s it he cried you have your promotion and i my barony we are going to fetch our brevets said d artagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them and where are we going asked porthos				14.385958304001171
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly				1786.359566539065
what are you looking at there				398.5325411738222
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy d artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him				7.006172383911145
night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps				855.5595629109739
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his distance from the chÃ¢teau but exhausting his strength				1907.22724425616
consent then i beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by mazarin as you see i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians anne was caught she could not draw back she signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep				2664.797067284919
all at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall				399.41413759718483
danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugÃ©nie to the opera				726.0371503851317
i have an infernal spirit				441.52947111125155
at length he raised his head fixed his eagle look upon that loyal open and intelligent countenance read upon that face furrowed with tears all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a month and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in that youth of twenty one years before him and what resources his activity his courage and his shrewdness might offer to a good master				1164.1580699163437
and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret				1494.8876715176168
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart				52.859731538918396
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm				482.73606849330395
bah said debray when she had left these are fine projects				10561.01851667333
the face of the latter became serious when he had cast his eyes upon the paper				591.2383966960615
charles listened with marked attention passing over the insults noting the grievances and when hatred overflowed all bounds and the accuser turned executioner beforehand replying with a smile of lofty scorn				12274.104090735815
the duke more and more bewildered let grimaud loose and took the note				5801.061980774297
that is why valentine passed through her room which was on a level with valentine s and only separated from it by edward s				62.1461843487587
besides he had another strange fancy which was always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of others				152.78340474166492
not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly everyone waited anxiously				8277.351932793898
be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses				454.84295332516075
he repaired therefore immediately to his hÃ´tel and caused himself to be announced				289.8986402097934
then along toward the fourth year came the expedition of franche comte				152.88754687656063
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said				11.394863562913498
will you examine them oh m beauchamp if you assure me that m de morcerf does not know these pistols you may readily believe that your word will be quite sufficient gentlemen said chÃ¢teau renaud it is not morcerf coming in that carriage faith it is franz and debray the two young men he announced were indeed approaching				645.0965071209474
here are some lozenges which i have made up on purpose they are compounded doubly strong monte cristo opened the tortoise shell box which the lady presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition				10994.967503213202
the abbÃ© busoni did right to send you to me he went on in his ordinary tone and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning you in future				2598.8850144704716
be this evening about ten o clock at st				450.1841902835995
and athos i don t see athos				36.92427064088659
there only his memory returned to him				39.26314052281721
let d artagnan speak said athos you know he always has wise advice to give clearly said d artagnan we must go where they will not look for us				63.39061575756101
the cemetery of the chÃ¢teau d if chapter				1.3672889514073527
to morrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton how can you doubt it sir				86.6708140070014
let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds d artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family				565.236390444805
don t disturb yourself julie said he				7.251747958261696
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors where i know not but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d emery and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant				13103.425548855692
it is a fine thing to have such credit really it is only in france these things are done				80.9840563621302
morbleu said athos as soon as they were again in motion reduced to two masters and grimaud and planchet				292.48583909111306
what will it signify if one two or three more are added				1681.932337327153
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal s motive				382062.7529845638
d artagnan has turned aside from buckingham whom she hates as she hates everyone she has loved the tempest with which richelieu threatened him in the person of the queen				43.705352991485015
in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m de villefort s house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnut trees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance				6295.624153025327
bonacieux but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets only she believed she could say she was not dead				44.496090650501166
the heroine of the bouquet kept her word she gave albert no sign of her existence the morrow or the day after				1628.9531127040734
therefore said monte cristo feigning to mistake his meaning therefore i will not for another instant retard the pleasure of your meeting				1298.0658137880473
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling				506.87108570000294
i begin and without any rhetoric allow me porthos said aramis				15.994256219032016
two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter a corridor in which were three sentinels opened a door and pushed him unceremoniously into a low room where the only furniture was a table a chair and a commissary				15432.189210506436
arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compiÃ¨gne and all is over madame danglars rose from her seat pale and cold				2115.044781401799
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept				4998.844433430808
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a bed enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep				332.51769512050794
it was my forgetfulness then pardon me now asked athos what are we to do with ourselves till evening				595.568749470168
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him				3.7257859201972603
i will leave him at the place i quit and he will conduct you to me and you say you will wait for me at armentiÃ¨res at armentiÃ¨res write that name on a bit of paper lest i should forget it				7.643954262256496
well she is a monster who at twenty five years of age has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals				7405.123231052689
sit down and i will read it again albert resumed his seat and beauchamp read with more attention than at first the lines denounced by his friend				213.48475926527684
every minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another vision but the man instead of dissolving like a shadow again approached her and said in an agitated voice now you may drink valentine shuddered				2315.1164577905324
i pity her then and you have reason for she is much to be pitied				26541.283834856116
it was now athos s turn to take a sly look				117.13304581225525
come caderousse no nonsense said he				8.098442062741817
without caring about them myself i live among those who are much occupied in them				78.75498607041922
a council was called on the same evening but nothing transpired of what had been decided on				73.43509666499486
i understand wait a little porthos before crying out for on my word you haven t reached the end said the gascon in a jesting tone				104.70440260302296
take courage sir but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude ah here is m dandrÃ© cried de blacas				7156.847919267059
you were saying signora said albert who was paying the most implicit attention to the recital that the garrison of yanina fatigued with long service had treated with the kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain possession of the person of my father it was then that ali tepelini after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom he reposed great confidence resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge and this officer asked albert do you remember his name signora monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl which was quite unperceived by albert				3342.6848477144363
let them come in cried the young princess bounding to the door				21.795721225096788
tomorrow morning answered the innkeeper				2773.844333049386
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food				3653.0218670041804
but mercÃ©dÃ¨s did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantÃ¨s				388.89199553594193
try and find a seat there is one by that geranium which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other leaves in the world besides leaves of paper beauchamp said albert it is of your journal that i come to speak indeed				830.9494717041919
but parry clasped his hands and implored him and at last he agreed				3067.528279550329
conclusion on the sixth of the following month the king in compliance with the promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle left his capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of buckingham s assassination				2897.278420408694
my son				54.67949004314618
these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were sicily pine apples pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis				1714.4930379074078
the count is in fashion i congratulate him upon it and have you replied to everyone as you have to me ah to be sure i have not answered you be satisfied we shall have this lion we are among the privileged ones were you at the opera yesterday no he was there ah indeed				120.75936870799266
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret				917.0475848565653
every evening he shuts himself in there				237.22553349658395
to grief succeeded rage				403.73208230546567
mine you have heard and that is to pursue you on earth to the tribunal of men in heaven to the tribunal of god you persist then i swear it before the god who hears me				8.330610181992888
then he let his head sink upon his two hands while d artagnan stood before him stupefied				1233.9082578784448
do you see it and the man held the torch to the wall				57.98992889766817
it is this i swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the of february between nine and ten o clock in the evening and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moments then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did				1124.3372993114383
well asked the abbÃ© as he returned to the apartment below what have you made up your mind to do to tell you all i know was the reply				548.1735794476048
no monsieur he has not a lady with him with whom is he then with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of amiens good heavens cried d artagnan is the poor fellow worse then no monsieur quite the contrary but after his illness grace touched him and he determined to take orders that s it said d artagnan i had forgotten that he was only a musketeer for a time monsieur still insists upon seeing him more than ever well monsieur has only to take the right hand staircase in the courtyard and knock at number five on the second floor d artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated and found one of those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our old fashioned taverns				30635.509204868966
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances				1268.477526583114
and having got out all he wanted he paid for the hypocras which he did not drink and went quickly back to the rue tiquetonne				23930.055748748884
can you tell us where we can obtain a sight of the piazza del popolo ah said the count negligently looking attentively at morcerf is there not something like an execution upon the piazza del popolo yes returned franz finding that the count was coming to the point he wished				1149.5943731703608
say i am condemned sir if you please but you know that god who loves martyrs sometimes permits the innocent to be condemned were you condemned were you innocent were you a martyr replied felton the greater would be the necessity for prayer and i myself would aid you with my prayers oh you are a just man cried milady throwing herself at his feet				171.6764778695253
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips				267.05962871188893
the sentinel opened the door it was a new face				193.06100177292257
but it must be acknowledged this response was but momentary				9542.340884796182
i can manage your business for you				10.483593946753816
the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the use of smokers				2471.480095857452
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob				2433.714516699099
signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped off				218.77220001240266
should you not have known me again in spite of my eight and forty years of age on the contrary i do not find you the same person at all i understand cried athos with a gentle blush				24086.802730118194
early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker				8661.909250188799
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message				953.2867338149488
the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty house it being one of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors and the buzz of conversation				374.5398779007703
when this was done eugÃ©nie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak				1335.09190243568
penelon penelon an old man who was digging busily at one of the beds stuck his spade in the earth and approached cap in hand striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek				2174.7355329236443
the old man recognized his child and carlini recognized the old man				3.3485349299667835
he saw that it was a merciless war between us a war to the death				464.5873168429447
no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good it is so good that i have distanced m de chÃ¢teau renaud one of the best riders in france and m debray who both mount the minister s arabians and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour then they follow you asked monte cristo				1.0389773851128372
the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair				1774.5298920133694
this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first				2906.3554465670045
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame				990.408557426253
yes and i would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence unless from deepest hell bravo said d artagnan in a whisper to porthos well answered well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people that broussel shall be given up to them madame never said the queen never your majesty is mistress said la meilleraie retreating a few steps				1008.4080301788911
i may be mistaken but i believe that raoul will be as accomplished a gentleman as our degenerate age could display the remembrance of milady recurred to d artagnan				1.0654352889681582
yes monsieur i know only him well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boy slayer not too much so replied d artagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you				8.300186074126582
well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know immediately why what is the matter it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all				62.94828274030027
and who brought you up he asked again				384.21137460166847
a crowd of masks flowed in from all sides emerging from the doors descending from the windows				322.1390891196288
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this				745.5259674216107
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud				176.506377680505
the sailors did not require much urging				5899.280753330995
on perceiving mazarin he bowed				263.62364404061157
there ensued a brief silence during which these two persons who at first sight recognized each other so clearly as of noble race examined each other without embarrassment on either side				2587.0277868825547
that was your fault all my oil is lost oil is a sovereign balm for wounds and my poor grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him all my sausages are gnawed there is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar you shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated host				1193.0024975804254
it anticipates through a sentiment which your eminence will appreciate measures to be taken after the events				2267.8473165988958
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other				61.45957200592242
you know you have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles at your choice yes well then i repeat you are wrong				1368.8169407410883
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society				2473.2814901696424
from th abyss he ll give ear to my moan felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified				7845.334127265296

a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs Ã©lysÃ©es which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences				20032.34875157919
and i also said franz				71.33138183746394
stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar				15106.609033564147
then according to foreign custom the presentations took place				127.34367015223033
mercÃ©dÃ¨s saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears				17180.211067937023
will you accompany me to the harbor maximilian i am entirely yours count morrel accompanied the count to the harbor				39098.86527158439

on their part the french on seeing the four friends return at such a step uttered cries of enthusiasm				676.05178885306

this recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph				4720.738893554478
villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study				748.4720680701353

when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the street was clear				1671.2332409707765
but i am sure that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed how have i deviated from those principles monsieur asked monte cristo who could not help looking at morrel with so much intensity that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing glance				1806.9349015753173
charles was indeed in the midst of them his hat on his head his brows bent striking his boot with his riding whip				1947.2733118354352

as for the old man his chest heaved with his panting respiration				4517.837144779285

he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la rÃ©serve and which had the postmark marseilles february delivery o clock p m but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be				170.1628540166002
the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared				66.95357838640051

however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra				12221.215870696582
now we are alone dear aramis said d artagnan tell me how the devil you managed to alight upon the back of planchet s horse i faith answered aramis as you see from heaven from heaven replied d artagnan shaking his head you have no more the appearance of coming from thence than you have of going there my friend said aramis with a look of imbecility on his face which d artagnan had never observed whilst he was in the musketeers if i did not come from heaven at least i was leaving paradise which is almost the same here then is a puzzle for the learned observed d artagnan until now they have never been able to agree as to the situation of paradise some place it on mount ararat others between the rivers tigris and euphrates it seems that they have been looking very far away for it while it was actually very near				6512.389481446259

m danglars no longer had a daughter				720.7440769972968
as for fernand himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to rest he was among the first to quit the table and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds he continued in utter silence to pace the farther end of the salon				410.21315004661534
peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch what are you going to do inquired the count				7.246116357822397

until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods				1614.5310344086952
i must speak to him about it as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement				1637.9976969497416

it is a rock of almost conical form which looks as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean				705.9938681559604
planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway while grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable undertaking that by five o clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready				781.8221559585116
the soldiers whom he was nearly trampling ran away				72.61229902137269
ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from us yes how is king otho getting on asked albert in the most sprightly tone				112.45415458404904
the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture				616.8217579725227
only imagine my dear friend				54.778814792582715

morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me no count but to leave paris if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you there valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them				36.31961211113723

he soon arranged a prompt and certain manner of traveling by sending relays of horses to chantilly so that he might be in paris in five or six hours				288.1325672513338
athos took his son s horse by the bridle and led him forth out of the melee				42602.245694616606
yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercÃ©dÃ¨s shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices				20395.255028846455
these keys were given up to him instantly				829.32296650425
what is the use of boring one s self with so many things				724.7345255245517
when albert returned to his mother he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole room so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom				1664.6812056691629
this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape				311.6339915862205
my god my dear host tell me if anything has happened to him your lordship must have observed that he could not continue his journey why to be sure he promised to rejoin us and we have seen nothing of him he has done us the honor to remain here what he had done you the honor to remain here yes monsieur in this house and we are even a little uneasy on what account of certain expenses he has contracted well but whatever expenses he may have incurred i am sure he is in a condition to pay them ah monsieur you infuse genuine balm into my blood				475.93364095445025

they are the spoils of victory i the heir of an enemy said athos for whom then do you take me it is the custom in war said d artagnan why should it not be the custom in a duel even on the field of battle i have never done that porthos shrugged his shoulders aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed athos				5.405504924676588
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris				105.08814365274993
at what hour does the examination take place at two o clock send at twelve said danglars smiling				21.600865908696854
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards				587.6724186699653
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity				2107.9314917707215
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them				106.72879033272544

she was said to have a weak chest and like antonia in the cremona violin she would die one day while singing				25353.17714362199
there was certainly enough in all this to turn a head only twenty three years old and mme				52.52962952363585
in the position of porthos d artagnan would have been perfectly happy and to make porthos contented there was wanting what				273.15482454969936
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx like smile				459.7417070836159
the world calls me beautiful				70.97638537564401
m de villefort has always passed for a severe but a just man there is then one said monte cristo whom you do not condemn like poor danglars because i am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps replied albert laughing				24.51420156766581

edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o the wisps that play about the marshes				59064.612619037776
gentlemen replied d artagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence				7576.531463830399
at the first announcement of peace madame de chevreuse frowned and in spite of all the logic of athos to show her that a prolonged war would have been impracticable contended in favor of hostilities				2645.3899156229168
you see then morrel that he was a more unhappy lover than you and has he found consolation he has at least found peace and does he ever expect to be happy he hopes so maximilian the young man s head fell on his breast				78.34966836006987
i think we are all taken prisoners except aramis and that our chances of getting out are lessened since one more of us is caught in mazarin s mousetrap which is far too strong for two of us but not strong enough for three of us returned d artagnan				1.054575204712029

oh enough of this enough of this he cried let me save the last on entering his house he met morrel who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb				860.4264765130519
at this moment a soldier entered to inform them that groslow was waiting for them				24.26266759694564
moreover its port was the last in the kingdom of france open to the english and by closing it against england our eternal enemy the cardinal completed the work of joan of arc and the duc de guise				194.89778518871438

oh my god my god i thank thee madame said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying voice				20.96005562067125
then seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject porthos called the host and asked for dice				1891.2024604387425
well so much the better for in that case i shall demand of his majesty permission to plead for him the king feared an outbreak				35606.81461359315
the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance two soldiers said d artagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out fine looking men upon my word said d artagnan				120.42240594138066
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity				13026.46219577262
for my own part i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my eyes so saying the countess quitted franz leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her fears and agitations were genuine				18284.978304119595

but the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat				1907.4618933889533

athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements				5267.389465066179

at this moment the garden was only occupied by about ten servants who had just received orders from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase				9277.977542019587
raoul delighted at the count s companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay				28444.731310266205
this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore				3793.93659744765

she herself was not exempt from internal emotion and without having done anything wrong yet fully comprehended that luigi was right in reproaching her				21.25173302249666

now after what you told me this morning of your heart i may believe well count replied morrel gayly i will not dispute it but you will not make me your confidant maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret				777.7743498290414

i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my position as if it were your own and then judge for yourself the young man reflected for a moment then an expression of sublime resignation appeared in his eyes and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank				1715.0711318760548
d artagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward ah yes said a light horseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly				1468.3105498215857

the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness				50901.34247913015
everything was as we have said a question of arithmetic to cocles and during twenty years he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the house should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow				2293.899528340776
d artagnan would have remonstrated at this but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and d artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince				570.6341875367838
let s be merciful to every sinner				3275.9188573328297

a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back				1623.6952828201304
oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle andrea bit his lips				50.20588303106709
when i informed him that your lordship was the protÃ©gÃ© of monsieur de trÃ©ville and that you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman he appeared to be very much disturbed and asked me where that letter was and immediately came down into the kitchen where he knew your doublet was then that s my thief replied d artagnan				1.0385421504110164
the boat was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out not that way if you please gaetano faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite side while two sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way				348.42470938280735
if you take one step farther d artagnan said he we shall cross swords together d artagnan sank on his knees and prayed				3298.12218625684
he was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with but on timidly opening his eyes he found himself with his nose fixed between the two shoulders of porthos that is to say exactly upon the baldric				1935.091164053077
there said d artagnan we can t be overtaken				5094.944570830807

how unfortunate i am said she i have been here six months without the shadow of recreation				20871.94663714839

how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason				1068.8249714046597
morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome with whom your father does business the young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase				445.72784694741

i do not know whether i love you or love you not but what i know is that i will not be perjured				7940.363972975941
as the town clock of newcastle struck one the sleeper awoke and with all the gestures of a man rousing himself out of deep sleep he looked attentively about him perceiving that he was alone he rose and making a little circuit passed close to the cavalier who was speaking to the sentinel				310.9566729937393
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me				97.58369412515636
fifty thousand francs muttered la carconte when left alone it is a large sum of money but it is not a fortune volume two chapter				30.855722970857542
at the usual time morrel had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtier s room				67.08690604138316

he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him				8.276238174105256
d artagnan thought of all these matters				1422.8110477516543

if you wish to see me the king s attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician at this moment and as though the utterance of villefort s wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear				1461.352941794994

valentine with a color still heightened by emotion entered the room just after her parents had quitted it				11.519280291845151
well said d artagnan one is never killed in a first engagement nor in the second said aramis nor in the third returned porthos and even when one is killed one rises again the proof of which is that here we are no said athos it is not raoul about whom i am anxious for i trust he will conduct himself like a gentleman and if he is killed well he will die bravely but hold should such a misfortune happen well athos passed his hand across his pale brow				233.96746693516087

in five minutes they arrived at the spot whence the noise had proceeded and then restraining their horses they advanced cautiously				127.83677578787606
i can not consent that this woman should die thus milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope				638.0279745682534
you told me yourself that that ring that ring i have				186.41179951406153

m de monte cristo may have heard it and to enlighten himself but why should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject asked villefort after a moment s reflection what interest can this m de monte cristo or m zaccone son of a shipowner of malta discoverer of a mine in thessaly now visiting paris for the first time what interest i say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless fact like this				248.24963048706203

it is not courage that is needed it is prudence and yet cried porthos we will not leave you will leave d artagnan to act as he thinks proper said athos				4.150351286066926
eugÃ©nie apparently calm although in all probability her heart beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her turn				82.23783834636998

so i will not abandon this bouquet pardieu returned franz laughing in token of your ingratitude the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when albert and franz again encountered the carriage with the contadini the one who had thrown the violets to albert clapped her hands when she beheld them in his button hole				391.44193439942063
she is goddaughter to laporte the confidential valet of the queen				23.48957266492564

no i don t want your help watch the cardinal i am watching said porthos				9.93500260703073
your horses got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad things and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress when a strange looking man an arab a negro or a nubian at least a black of some nation or other at a signal from the count whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to death himself and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape				510.5238692835144
while monte cristo had begged the smelling bottle of madame de villefort he had noticed the approach of villefort to madame danglars and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the words had been uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars				8.30787971519798
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose				122.62695750522984
certainly neither i nor fernand said danglars rising and looking at the young man who still remained seated but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung into the corner				577.5622026722453
it would be wrong to judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another				141.3948322478227
what the devil would you have me do with that said the englishman				25.183647081855813
pooh said the duke too much astonished to believe it true				409.2345344050028

he was the son of a banker at lyons named particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to emery and cardinal richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to louis xiii				1.5043666140370686
the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man				323.60877239544817
listen said m de trÃ©ville shall i give you counsel good counsel the counsel of a friend you will do me honor monsieur said d artagnan				1.0246889594751227

a fÃªte was so rare a thing for poor anne of austria that at this announcement as the cardinal had predicted the last trace of her resentment disappeared if not from her heart at least from her countenance				130.54194135470053
grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out				71.60646750016208
the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of trÃ©ville				220.58858542844922
he wore a mask but you aramis who were close to him i could see nothing but a gray beard under the fringe of the mask then it must be a man of a certain age oh said d artagnan that matters little				822.9271974629181
valentine said a low voice				38.08219706803487
that we may be more at our ease la ramee removes the guards keeping only grimaud to wait on us				154.9880218491863
do you wish for a name				150.60267833549543
she saw nothing she listened and she heard nothing				117.84032163317316
it has arrived at the hÃ´tel des princes rue de richelieu				162.22055061512208
but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass she but who is she oh i remember said mme				24.043539051061675
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape d artagnan appeared to authorize the issue				893.335249074871
oh that is very good indeed it is very good said louise looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black hair those magnificent braids which made all the ladies sigh with envy will they go under a man s hat like the one i see down there you shall see said eugÃ©nie				58.483499780804564
then it became the turn of athos porthos and aramis to mount guard with d artagnan when he was on duty				755.3181804199379
a prisoner repeated porthos quite dejected				97.67279613025843
the vicomte de bragelonne who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty is the friend of my son who owes to him his life he is a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely in case your majesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me				35.95015988450701
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine excellent exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips				40.80627384197312
never more to be separated why as to that i think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it as for me you must know i can not possibly live out of lucca therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent certainly i am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hands and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life where are these papers then here they are andrea seized the certificate of his father s marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents				219.11139419408852
he entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes his left hand on the pommel of the sword and cracking his whip with his right hand				65.9569040764629
my offers did not arouse him did not even tempt him so much the worse				1093.2379061715324
hereafter perhaps i shall have the right of giving myself at present i shall appear to sell myself that is to say you refuse to serve me monsieur said the cardinal with a tone of vexation through which however might be seen a sort of esteem remain free then and guard your hatreds and your sympathies monseigneur well well said the cardinal i don t wish you any ill but you must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense our friends				128.13697680137176
now sir said d artagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier				5969.2920885048925
it is not of him that i am now thinking				267.58199444277534
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions				223.4102871001342
in truth the lieutenant s horse stumbled and fell on his knees then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay down to die				535.207883709918
you have managed my affairs so well that i ought to allow you all the time you require for your own				221.82554320915537
now that she believed herself to be no longer observed a sentiment resembling ferocity animated her countenance				158.32608485675885
franz and albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the cicerone sprang into the seat behind				1896.1598042456517
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great lady for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass				2565.845407361114
our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village and enter with us one of the houses which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada				353.0779055993783
barrois said she				21.226763272913967
ah my dear fellow said albert rising and lighting his third cigar really i thought you had more courage so saying the two young men went down the staircase and got into the carriage				99.38227233913813
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first which must much diminish the face value of your bill monsieur porthos and render yours almost null monsieur aramis				84.69587396065414
when he was alone he opened the door of the corridor and then that of the ante chamber				72.57249205803444
the physician has a sacred mission on earth and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb				695.4519089380517
and do you believe he knew you again kitty i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him but perhaps it was too late go down athos he mistrusts you less than me and see if he be still at his door athos went down and returned immediately				272.43367013338167
at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open and the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk what monk the monk that was shut in with me no he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the window				36.26101020148775
the coadjutor remained immovable and not a muscle of his face was discomposed only his glance flashed like a sword in returning the furious looks of the queen				40.11108679632967
four hundred and seventy five livres said d artagnan who reckoned like archimedes				1213.594870364647
revolving all this in her mind she cast her eyes around her and arranged the topography of the garden in her head				52.6394798589111
the examination chapter				1.3319432620380547
i have what is still better				45.5968775374768

ah exclaimed aramis that is the nephew the monk and the son of milady as he says himself alas yes murmured de winter				7.579341994606746
those on the other side had followed their example thus favoring the views of the four friends who preferred having them close at hand to chasing them about the chamber				182.89119108189223
oh my god my god and she rose with her hair dishevelled and her lips foaming				1110.6530101188716
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything				207.25858340475907
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general and who charges me with this monseigneur said d artagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me what do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus of milady de winter replied d artagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished she has been punished monseigneur and who has punished her we she is in prison she is dead dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead				910.9064935067538
he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the minister				235.73346883997078
my dear athos he said i am going away				124.186029789907
neither of them had returned				262.12535950355414
and that one thing your lost child ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting the worthy major raised his eyes to heaven and sighed				781.743871488552
i know him not personally but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal oh no certainly not well reveal your secret to him and ask him whether however important however valuable however terrible it may be you may not confide it to me but this secret is not mine and i can not reveal it in this manner you were about to confide it to monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan with chagrin				253.84239953135264
on the contrary i think they are poor sir they are friends of yours then yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and i would lay down my life for them very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more i will give them to you i will not even ask who they are do as you like with them thank you sir exclaimed mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should i lose it i should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it				9.500289477325705
it was said athos had met with great crosses in love and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of this gallant man				35.532141092400586
pay no attention to it you have nothing to occupy yourself with but being happy then i have full occupation for i am so not yet wait a little				186.1613036052092
as you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information				621.2935672412552
and what a coat sir for a prince of the cavalcanti the keeper turned his back and shrugged his shoulders he did not even laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so he had heard so many utter the same things indeed he heard nothing else				444.87468040053096
he was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which ornano puylaurens and his uncle had died				569.5829479476619
i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste really				264.15301808525817
yes i have need of it the mendicant uttered these words in a tone of such humility such earnest repentance that gondy placed his hand upon him and gave him his benediction with all the unction of which he was capable				108.50116414877871
and the other which the short one oh he was not a gentleman i ll answer for it besides he did not wear a sword and the others treated him with small consideration some lackey murmured d artagnan				1.0357422843607673
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces				453.96303142374376
besides your own fortune as your father assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed				296.8768520726877
but when napoleon returned to paris danglars heart failed him and he lived in constant fear of dantÃ¨s return on a mission of vengeance				158.00879255201357
who is this creature grimaud did not answer but bowed a second time				64.73943872396855
they are binding her they are going to drag her away cried d artagnan to himself springing up from the floor				135.61223171223818
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty				686.7674768699046
now planchet has an excellent memory and i will be bound that sooner than relinquish any possible means of vengeance he will allow himself to be beaten to death				262.547919707577
bonacieux you will ruin us all but i have sworn to kill that man said d artagnan				1.030021071145597
the opportunity was good				165.48523070444375
he strictly followed the instructions he had received				190.72808407971345
the sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor				910.3841154095903
therefore when at dessert upon a sign from d artagnan porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone porthos said d artagnan who will attend you in your campaigns why replied porthos mouston of course this was a blow to d artagnan				4031.8437839531935
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious				4180.955060987078

your pardon sir said milady with mildness				301.0909091458957
d artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night				473.3435803477811
however she offered the cardinal laporte s place which he accepted and went from one carriage to the other				36.56283919358597

i dragged myself toward the bed to seek the only defense i had left my saving knife but i could not reach the bolster				269.8965327187022
mercÃ©dÃ¨s turned her eyes with an ineffable look towards heaven				104.9897738160015
or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything villefort s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary				3390.6164026976644
he regrets the devil				54.3018909037103
m de villefort s communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between m noirtier m d Ã©pinay and himself and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off				190.06116176321808
they obtained information at ablain and a statement of their route was left for grimaud				400.9932703226553
without having been in the school of the abbÃ© faria the worthy master of la jeune amÃ©lie the name of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provenÃ§al and this while it spared him interpreters persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the vessels he met at sea with the small boats sailing along the coast or with the people without name country or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible means of support				761.9823446138439
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which d artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeer s uniform				701.3329980749932
not crush that accursed race murmured he abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment				1597.3396699481611

tell me pardieu it was the most simple thing in the world				84.45249396341056
but what did m danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself half malicious half ferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame				1439.565533086538
the return also of the conqueror of lens was the pretext for giving a grand banquet				220.95208783560338

but in what force was the enemy				114.94035893230706
his eyes took a strange expression and with the step of a tiger cat he advanced toward the hedge but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense when a sonorous and short cry made him start and attracted the attention of the musketeers				532.2569238097225
the return chapter xxix				4.92048055939893

she remained nearly always in her second floor chamber shivering in her chair or stretched languid and feeble on her bed while her husband kept his daily watch at the door a duty he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her husband would calmly return an unvarying reply in these philosophic words hush la carconte				21.266477479430648

life itself may be resolved into three words erat est fuit which means said d artagnan who began to suspect the truth				233.61429779220748
i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron s banking establishment i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it and further that he stated to m danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions				422.9464192028358
cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet d artagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme				72.6242107376539
silence whispered the duke she has her reasons she will ruin us returned the prince				94.90645585341554
d artagnan observed on the bench nearest to the pillar against which porthos leaned a sort of ripe beauty rather yellow and rather dry but erect and haughty under her black hood				361.287897457416
to how much said she				21.57077970138107

the casket passed around the table but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to hand				271.9622580666805
happily he did not meet anyone				415.8231651275725
you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money				299.92807903073657
what was most clear in the matter was that d artagnan loved milady like a madman and that she did not love him at all				42.671244271530355
bring me a carafe of water said the abbÃ©				19.030532888344318
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening				67.73608743905415
he saw nothing unless that by traces of smoke others had before him attempted the same thing and like him in vain				149.64388070379096
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantÃ¨s handled the helm				8142.963958459249
the escape was fixed to take place at seven o clock there was therefore three quarters of an hour to wait				1435.710175703022
i suppose you have a blue ribbon in your pocket yes madame i have that of the garter which king charles i gave me some days before he died come i am growing an old woman said the duchess pensively				76.90502804273262
they were untouched the hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers pocket and in that of his greatcoat he found the little note case containing his letter of credit for francs				206.65759031352889
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised d artagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter				1094.5236574268984
monsieur de beaufort or another				242.80428024439345

have you finished grimaud grimaud made a sign in the affirmative and pointed to a dozen bodies which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes				181.44568352738776

we ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who loves her child				218.5035357884063
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided				185.21151371736116
the favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced for such a paltry sum as he owes you if i durst say what i believe on that head what you believe i ought rather to say what i know what you know and even what i am sure of and of what are you so sure i would say that i know this great lady you yes i and how do you know her oh monsieur if i could believe i might trust in your discretion speak				1282.3380060900583
my dear count you can not imagine how my mind is harassed				764.6481099195639
monseigneur said marshal de grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son count de guiche and his traveling companion viscount de bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him what eagerly replied the prince will i permit				2963.047954827671

on arriving at the hotel de la chevrette they found the baron s equipage all ready and mousqueton on his saddle				121.12822892299653
we make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money				470.5838022035346
it is true between ourselves that m de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art				652.8314311203262
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent				312.60779097466207
mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her				12.91917910136127

an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion				265.2774381112733
if i find you alive on my return you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie madame de villefort sighed her nerves gave way and she sunk on the carpet				2763.2290908411987
for what said the count				8.170437999607326
a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long athos will act porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood				1214.2443310425097
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected				645.3792589696592
bonacieux was acquainted with all the turnings and windings of this part of the louvre appropriated for the people of the household				871.9506947902684

i was in the power of a man whom i not only detested but despised of a man capable of anything and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was able to do but who then was this man asked felton				49.91586452746021

the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes				1097.502588355401
arriving unexpectedly in sight of the isle of rÃ© with ninety vessels and nearly twenty thousand men he had surprised the comte de toiras who commanded for the king in the isle and he had after a bloody conflict effected his landing				3030.3827366059536
thanks said the poor abbÃ© shivering as though his veins were filled with ice				64.04432759880277
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie				984.1665672489331
i ask your excellencies pardon but this is quite a french demand for the next week you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button then i must give up the idea no we have them ready made				278.6270723438681
he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged				1058.4370181855802

but to grieve my father to disturb my grandmother s last moments never you are right said morrel calmly				117.80790409133897
in addition to this after a half hour s conversation d artagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head				144.36087848114462
she was a most atrocious woman and then said aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in god what is the use of thinking of it all				672.6811725435136
he insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from monsieur de conti or monsieur de beaufort or monsieur de bouillon or monsieur d elbeuf or the coadjutor or madame de longueville or broussel or the parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance				742.3839922751206
porthos brought up the rear and before soldiers officers or colonel had time to recover their surprise all four were in the street				252.46590907696793
he found athos reclining upon a large sofa where he was waiting as he said for his outfit to come and find him				4.8929131709889875
he found kitty at the gate and as on the preceding evening went up to her chamber				157.3476005979531

the famous secretaire is in the dressing room is there a window in the dressing room two one here and one there andrea sketched two windows in the room which formed an angle on the plan and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom				467.2105506743749
this is not the way that i wished to avenge myself said milady replacing the glass upon the table with an infernal smile but my faith				247.0762418482668
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage				403.6851115100563
have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you				45.73223897935186
a moment later friquet went out carrying in his hand a large leather bag he opened it as soon as he was outside the chamber and to his great astonishment found it full of gold				159.19044633306993
in one of the despatches the cardinal declares to the queen that the treasury is empty and that her majesty has no more money				173.94847194789656

prepare yourself then to start at once and by whom is this order given asked the king				17.747785675197104
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit				658.7505937745477
he was an irishman one of the most skillful of his craft and who himself confessed that he gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the duke of buckingham				282.90848810135077
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you wish me to do so yes well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron by whom are you charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable				154.25485957689307
there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and i will say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land				352.45720097911146
three or four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds				945.9782541242529
sire resumed trÃ©ville as i told you monsieur d artagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen				1753.218844900135
this is a boy trÃ©ville a mere boy				579.9991389425307
yes said milady				19.505890101371758

arrested at compiegne they have been carried to rueil at rueil they have been questioned by the cardinal who has either kept them near him or sent them to saint germain				40.963758254780316
ah yes he said as if awaking from a dream				399.5034712165343
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair				2606.654277683791
he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone				131.96489423483254
what hinders it exclaimed the king				17.589265969605563
dantÃ¨s stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the chÃ¢teau d if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed				191.76330509557354

finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist				2462.6548317007523

desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good abbess would go she began to tell a story obscure at first but very circumstantial afterward about the cardinal relating the amours of the minister with mme				70.78083284908276
once across the barriers these two knew neither fatigue nor fear				675.3484286749512
since i was a faithful servant my lord to cardinal richelieu during his life it stands to reason that now after his death i should serve you well in defiance of the whole world with regard to myself monsieur de rochefort replied mazarin i am not like monsieur de richelieu all powerful				308.45705925079596
athos imparted to him his greatness of soul porthos his enthusiasm aramis his elegance				3607.2552311552345
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we have the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes				78.70370496052742
d artagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind				606.8926355265384
you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames the letter is destroyed you and i alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are saved be satisfied i will deny it it was the only letter you had it was swear it i swear it villefort rang				856.6266420164027
and who was he twas that low fellow bonacieux and porthos enchanted at having relieved his mind rejoined mousqueton and they disappeared around an angle of the street				209.50858341397267
although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep				190.14591804548385
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation				914.1730324537522
well i must confess it does replied d artagnan				1.0342925801880445
lucien had found time preparatory to the count s arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars				7.051238819766764
leave the saucepan said dantÃ¨s you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast this advice was to the jailer s taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip				672.2758548480966
i said the origin of his fortune remained obscure				690.5316151354363
were i in her majesty s place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate i should release broussel and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen				13135.593214071625
and if the suspicions of your majesty which i still continue to doubt should prove to have any foundation what a terrible disclosure what a fearful scandal but as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief he should have been louis xiii				1.682637589444928
the whole but how my god by a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which i likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinal s police and what did you understand by what we said a thousand things				1245.7533990640595
lucien debray is an old friend of ours and private secretary to the minister of the interior				590.6601706860316
d artagnan comprehended their irresolution				779.9585074222884
certainly as m danglars says you are rich and perfectly free				818.6462750645898
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercÃ©dÃ¨s desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan				362.23406533262374
monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i confess how you obtained this animal benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity				12619.96200927887
go on said felton you see plainly that i listen and that i am anxious to know the end evening came the ordinary events took place				178.4446534009934
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled				176.33400822583278
this room was occupied by dantÃ¨s father				174.34980786473218
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other				303.2224127779644
help cried caderousse i am murdered we are here take courage ah it s all over				794.8167247664712
she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head the devil				214.47744764543674
it so happened that night that cucumetto had sent carlini to a village so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting				469.47235765288855
i shall faint again monte cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial				488.47485408481685
i require that his majesty should deign to be godfather to the child she has just borne and that my lord after having been present at the christening should go to proffer his homage to our holy father the pope that is you wish me to lay aside my ministerial functions to quit france and be an exile i wish his eminence to become pope on the first opportunity allowing me then the right of demanding full indulgences for myself and my friends mazarin made a grimace which was quite indescribable and then turned to d artagnan				1.0386573060023812
allegro he called out to the postilions at every ascent				323.6806882335496
i have touched the hand of the great man cried bonacieux				72.50148222054811
one of them hat in hand said to him would you believe it monsieur				90.52013562308788
he was a man of twenty five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining				713.4128272032093
madame danglars and eugÃ©nie were going out at that moment they heard the cause of the disturbance				1453.641364054912
it was from mme				20.350832972042728
moliÃ¨re had not written his scene in l avare then				384.5827298335367
gentlemen we are arrived take the gate on the left				814.3503434577204
have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a state councillor then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly				946.7607461037123
the whole city seemed peopled with fantastic beings silent shadows were seen unpaving the streets and others dragging and upsetting great wagons whilst others again dug ditches large enough to ingulf whole regiments of horsemen				288.56677902792467
monte cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum it was the first time he had ever seen mademoiselle d armilly of whom he had heard much				347.11002337190695
and then said aramis pinching his ear to make it red as he rubbed his hands to make them white and then i made a certain rondeau upon it last year which i showed to monsieur voiture and that great man paid me a thousand compliments a rondeau said the jesuit disdainfully				379.6547891165798
come speak my worthy corsican speak what do you wish me to say i will help you				10.374216245495168
d artagnan went last still shaking his head				15.44134091307567
your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides				1346.868192764462
my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern				466.1730882651776
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps				883.8028761014575
there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand				895.6047423179867
he then seemed more easy				410.17833385683815
milady is fair you say she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable ah my poor d artagnan said athos				3.8417397777408193
you see mother i treat you handsomely for thirty five francs albert then took a pen and wrote frs				847.144563313716
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape				309.85752485946796
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell oh				343.1300374522956
as d artagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse				198.11306631330376
today i am at your service replied the count				8.762526743781335
the commissary who had till this time held his head down over his papers looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with				232.73015428717022
the sitting commences at two it is now three and i am to speak go then and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling				436.337848140901
d artagnan of the king s guards company dessessart is expected at the palais cardinal this evening at eight o clock				4088.592736901903
had dantÃ¨s found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale				179.7812779778285
last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds				1486.8332206390144
rest assured gentlemen that within three days in a less time than justice would demand the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth and grasped the old man s senseless hand				48.8057967899351
i could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne				1297.0523432992113
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to them				20.488194117551647
this awakening you have given me allow me then to enjoy it at my ease and taking her hand she drew her toward the armchair by the bedside				2325.135296335857
the king as we have said was to follow as soon as his bed of justice had been held but on rising from his bed of justice on the twenty eighth of june he felt himself attacked by fever				287.45053593363076
while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table				78.49741698556367
and your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them				25.46572162193521
the young lady went towards madame morrel				39.83193660550519
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river				345.3231048409996
chÃ¢teau renaud contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane				1427.9432514396508
you will not swear my master said the concierge shaking his head				18.71065006737402
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit				3928.3180819426325
at every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound				1403.4173109538378
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration				354.86840013643683
you were always a merry companion my dear d artagnan he said and your witty gascon fancy has not deserted you				9.759348638351385
it is a long time madame said the procureur describing a half circle with his chair so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame danglars it is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful conversation nevertheless sir you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for you villefort smiled bitterly				31.20658110522888
you will have sufficient time before five o clock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station				6238.3144778286905
what for that they may try a month hence to marry me again and to whom m				57.11851646767648
while in that service he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from everyone				2141.685125350098
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin				383.51984443097126
i recollect then i paid the host six what a brute of a host				687.8394874988202
he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer wall and re enter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra				199.27947808620402
i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much and i hate her said chÃ¢teau renaud				3.5939249271139553
yes said he i came quickly i wanted to speak to you are all your family well asked the count with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt				1289.6031632948632
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort				4.074337946015927
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbÃ©				1249.4965948802874
three days afterward the four musketeers were in paris they had not exceeded their leave of absence and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to m de trÃ©ville				21.218070504887287
there is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and milady s every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other that s exactly the reason i won t go said d artagnan				1.0355632296075388
the interior of the musketeers chapter viii				42.62453225945288
i think he has only been introduced to madame de villefort still he ought to have been here said debray i wonder what will be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the day				237.61441204431787
during the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue her mind required repose				246.74599130908254
d artagnan reassured her as well as he could and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of milady				92.65451980021125
athos alone remained seated calm and thoughtful				317.17684707962746
dantÃ¨s had not eaten since the preceding evening but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now				515.2527291365006
silence then cried athos				3.2194062988274537
a hundred writers since socrates seneca st augustine and gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet i can well understand that a father s sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son				270.5133074640988
to arms cried grimaud				25.235420832442298
one said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death				285.6503375753683
they could willingly have strangled m de trÃ©ville if at the bottom of all this they had not felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus				1049.7455911591119
he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything				140.29462272890225
let us understand each other my lord replied d artagnan and let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake				304.21924495250516
mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice from behind the trees				2344.481406006558
what will they leave him				9.364816072456872
your hand dantÃ¨s				408.91443781808067
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it				169.34563355034473
speak i beg you i will never confess that but to the man who should read to the bottom of my soul d artagnan looked at kitty for the second time				56.55922582924112
she did not invoke god we very well know but she had faith in the genius of evil that immense sovereignty which reigns in all the details of human life and by which as in the arabian fable a single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world				139.85725981086975
if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them said monte cristo				1.0557240258535856
it is he whom we must warn				54.75844453299042
in fact said athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did add to that d artagnan s rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth and here we are at the ninth				621.6752619876837
your eminence is right				123.35117185459504
people in general he said only ask advice not to follow it or if they do follow it it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it porthos arrived a minute after d artagnan				1.0578106642327265
he is my master and i am his slave he has the right to notice nothing the count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost recesses of his heart his eyes met those of the young girl and he could not bear their brilliancy				402.00488989860685
one day when he had an appointment with a duchess he endeavored even to borrow it of athos				60.778082135558876
what was the other day a crime is today a title to favor				11357.58137332114
the most important thing was not to kill him only for i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred times but to kill him without being discovered at least without being arrested				993.8341286332168
occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him sometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a president or some dowager duchess				1334.253735223847
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility				730.8768348452659
well now let us talk a little seriously said milady in her turn drawing her armchair nearer to d artagnan s chair				253.18840898777407
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong				1417.418800763726
read said the old man				1.868973477333007
no do not seek any longer to discover the reason				505.0555901932383
yes borgia has been here a torch in one hand a sword in the other and within twenty paces at the foot of this rock perhaps two guards kept watch on land and sea while their master descended as i am about to descend dispelling the darkness before his awe inspiring progress but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret asked dantÃ¨s of himself				39.35804515293849
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence				239.04758578196285
monsieur de gondy would pay a hundred thousand francs for such a secret you are thoughtful said mazarin uneasily				259.8670550843944
after which the cardinal who had been informed that d artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him took leave of the king inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke				2152.71006436491
the next morning at daybreak valentine and morrel were walking arm in arm on the seashore valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room explained everything revealed the crime and finally how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death				191.40866385861406
i did not do it intentionally and not doing it intentionally i said excuse me it appears to me that this is quite enough				155.5079941682499
she was in a little boudoir hung with blue damask adorned by red flowers with a foliage of gold looking upon a garden and reclined upon a sofa her head supported on the rich tapestry which covered it				7.5638713356975975
tenacem propositi virum				1007.5457605675207
have you seen him i left him five days ago said d artagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston				331.9160413916535
well i had promised madame de villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gone positively gone				923.5264004324973
from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds				779.1919992994027
in my house murmured he in my house come magistrate said m d avrigny show yourself a man as an interpreter of the law do honor to your profession by sacrificing your selfish interests to it you make me shudder doctor				2357.936215163933
yes i recognize the voice which speaks to me in my dreams yes i recognize the features of the angel who appears to me every night crying to my soul which can not sleep strike save england save thyself for thou wilt die without having appeased god speak speak cried felton i can understand you now a flash of terrible joy but rapid as thought gleamed from the eyes of milady				67.30860711790794
i grasped the railings if i had relaxed my hold for a moment i should have fallen				562.5177748467584
i was brought here by night so devil take me if i know where i am well said comminges suppose one thing i will suppose anything you please suppose there were a window in this wall well from that window you would see monsieur de la fere at his the count then is in the chateau yes for what reason the same as yourself athos a prisoner you know well replied de comminges that there are no prisoners at rueil because there is no prison don t let us play upon words sir				322.8621637037069

here cried the steward here whilst the groom ran to a neighboring building				1507.7649891660353
d artagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments				4782.6665461253415
this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the count s box				821.7825720275525
they are robbers perhaps he muttered				31.309611976005577
it is well said he kissing it it is my master s ring and throwing the match on the ground he trampled on it and extinguished it				9.892785401690315
d avrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every morning				426.6695258524148
albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the english eminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggish have invented for fishing				487.25772004303275
but i can not said she i am not strong enough do you shut it ah you do well to ask said eugÃ©nie laughing i forgot that i was hercules and you only the pale omphale and the young girl kneeling on the top pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together and mademoiselle d armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through				1326.3138658676514
after which your majesty will i think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair				176.2591065352242
i have but little influence now but all that i have shall most assuredly be his				569.6331958520738
in one of the mourning coaches beauchamp debray and chÃ¢teau renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness				1191.4550435771314
nor was that surprising				126.75336552446926
where is this lemonade asked the doctor eagerly				33.61738213560786
the hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss				987.7019417231523
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded				511.8042454266696
leave us alone then and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves gentlemen said jussac it is with great regret that i pronounce the thing impossible				408.1858415515941
you do not know these men monsieur comminges but i know them first personally also by hearsay				357.5336721723197
one morning he took this man on one side and had succeeded in speaking to him when grimaud entered and seeing what was going on approached the duke respectfully but took the guard by the arm				479.921757315308
two of the men from jacopo s boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to marseilles				175.46614818652614

the fire crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no prisoner fell down as they expected				115.51227181915117
these were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept				557.7972751628995
certainly said d artagnan				1.0554865578326333
there are about two hundred in paris and three thousand in france and then perhaps on entering the convent he changed his name				180.46134257999753
i should not have guessed it				8.330709491196949
your treasure stammered dantÃ¨s				127.94093330792883
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess two years exclaimed dantÃ¨s do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned				3674.278873000462
meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape only for him it passed more slowly				463.1458304710518
one day when he arrived with his head in the air and as light at heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold he found the soubrette under the gateway of the hÃ´tel but this time the pretty kitty was not contented with touching him as he passed she took him gently by the hand				74.04134132934172
i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the count				29.894693742708874
oh if such a thought could present itself i would stab myself to punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it indeed my dear friend said m d avrigny i would not accuse anyone i speak only of an accident you understand of a mistake but whether accident or mistake the fact is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you				12.493839126445177
the ball had entered his breast through a notch in the cuirass				3940.21945200282
murmured he growing still paler				320.71492203509666
is it thus you perform your charge monsieur continued the king without directly replying to de trÃ©ville s question				150.44118583771362
i hear no balls whistle and i see nobody they are firing at the corpses replied athos				4.502428760731351
but this is tyranny cried one of them in very good french though with a foreign accent that this madman will not allow these good people access to their own wine				297.2159448044674
of how much does he rob you every year on my word replied the count not more than another				145.74106949592883
had he but waited till today the price would have fallen to and instead of gaining francs he would have lost or and what has caused the sudden fall from to asked monte cristo				1.0351563684425422
farewell to all the feelings that expand the heart				356.13893138013566
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom				566.880728250846
she expected every moment that she should see morrel appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor				506.94118208719607
some years only				67.17852257586978
but d artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips				38.25184299330755
does he hate his majesty as much as he does us pardi answered athos we only carried off his mother the king has spoiled him of his name and property true said aramis but silence				634.5155446372798
bertuccio said the count i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man possessed by a devil who will not leave him and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret				1221.5686405369772
where on the balcony not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur d artagnan is right the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger				2423.2682605208533
as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap				522.5942106049184
he hit him but once but as he had foretold that hit was a mortal one the sword pierced his heart				34.94419716195377
he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything				249.87476544380002
what am i to do nothing very difficult but what is it to repeat these signs monte cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked				149.52355193609841
see answered the voice				55.98031412034266
i charge him also with my blessing for my children and with the sentiments of my soul for yourself my dearest sweetheart the letter bore the signature not of charles king but of charles still king and let him be no longer king cried the queen				10.23330983206693
fortunately as d artagnan had thought it was not dangerous				2015.3846117926348
this voice made everyone bow before it resembling in its effect the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield obeisance				795.3141259105093
come my friend said danglars seeing that he made no impression on peppino you will not refuse me a glass of wine i have already told you that we do not sell at retail well then let me have a bottle of the least expensive they are all the same price and what is that twenty five thousand francs a bottle tell me cried danglars in a tone whose bitterness alone has been capable of revealing tell me that you wish to despoil me of all it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal it is possible such may be the master s intention the master who is he the person to whom you were conducted yesterday where is he here let me see him certainly and the next moment luigi vampa appeared before danglars				96.16017046715413
come sweep away all that for me				7.130393598117754
now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the carriage this did not take long				1919.007946158083
call the prince inform him that it is his turn to sign cried danglars to one of the floorkeepers				7374.635623993249
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back				156.68260061752537
franz who had mutely interrogated the countess and received from her a gracious smile in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of albert s eager impatience but began at once the tour of the house closely followed by albert who availed himself of the few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat				207.20897738799812
i will leave the paternal home i will give up all				42.10024893924449
this time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony i began to feel a devouring hunger				4441.504271025704
the jailer went out and returned in an instant with a corporal and four soldiers				701.4580829193204
what is it i hear a horse it belongs to one of our companions who is overtaking us no said d artagnan it is in advance that is another thing said porthos and he listened toward the quarter indicated by d artagnan				1.239270331510694
we were beginning to grow impatient said athos				4.599662157381891
d artagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it				6.112588290079936
you may make your mind easy said the doctor he is dead				75.32741163896813
mademoiselle danglars was still the same cold beautiful and satirical				299.9375182915579
he has he is an abbÃ© ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan				2229.4013865104343
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there revenge for instance observed franz				38.79880970020391
gentlemen continued he addressing the guardsmen i request you will be silent with regard to this adventure				728.6942503156962
hush returned rochefort				36.224243108975536
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d artagnan				1.0578258043253081
read that he said				2.6178277867775988
come he said it is only a veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of cavalcanti				396.84746156822786
are there then in england two men to whom such an epithet can be applied you mean george villiers asked felton whose looks became excited				720.7000876124041
valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear eugÃ©nie				987.7636411114817
yes grandpapa said valentine it is so				78.45314920838683
you are thoughtful sir continued morrel you want something shall i call one of the servants yes replied noirtier				74.82386683978244
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose above the water blind as a new born puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton				1022.4084841278324
do you not know the race said he				11.921715947429535
every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could provide was heaped in vases from china and jars from japan				139.69156883886515
you went to sleep full of thoughts of vengeance they weighed heavily upon your stomach you had the nightmare that s all				66.80382183823512
everything had gone on as usual at the palais royal				27.54960787349981
come come with me gentlemen exclaimed mazarin				33.55582718923922
let me have some dinner at once				106.56118121295083
and am i not a hundred times better thus cried eugÃ©nie smoothing the scattered curls of her hair which had now quite a masculine appearance and do you not think me handsomer so oh you are beautiful always beautiful cried louise				168.5710770170517
d artagnan returned to the rue tiquetonne with porthos still possessed by the wish to find out who the man was that he had killed				129.51197474620645
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered				531.245731652004
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips				188.9617707641139
i thought so madame stammered the young girl				23.59310984824533
before an hour has passed you will be discovered arrested obliged to kill me which would be a crime unworthy of loyal gentlemen like you he is right thought athos				5.64057803325259
he listened attentively and fancied that he discovered through three or four rather frivolous adventures that the count like himself had a secret to hide in the depths of his heart				34.50765168765309
and pray what do you call such an action but who said it was buried alive why bury it there if it were dead				46.348814164755865
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of benedetto who was continually tormenting her for money as long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession				1999.0181522012117
on reflection my dear du vallon it is a great honor for the comte de la fere and gives good reason to hope				468.25813677882013
you have no idea my friend how my bones ache since i came here				86.95885085408227
oh if you know him tell me by a man of from forty to forty five years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left temple that is he that is he but his name ah his name				136.1826087459014
at the first blow the sound ceased as if by magic				6146.707878388467
the young man burst into a laugh				344.4498509141857
when he reappeared athos received him with the same paternal smile as that which he had often bestowed on d artagnan but a more profound tenderness for raoul was now visibly impressed upon his face				98.7866764437278
there will be eleven crowns gained it is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that remained in d artagnan s purse				322.72886820922395
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husband s father yes madame m de villefort spoke of it to me a paralysis i think alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire				1440.4980182297277
title the three musketeers author alexandre dumas release date march ebook most recently updated june language english start of the project gutenberg ebook the three musketeers the three musketeers by alexandre dumas pÃ¨re first volume of the d artagnan series contents author s preface chapter i				92.55247347306334
yes sir he said				2.3743135497147905
i do not mean that for you blacas continued louis xviii				7.9800664251609525
the sea knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells the whole was cemented by two hundred years beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the sea				131.69157643911578
but the queen pressed the child s hand				23.93425297350975
chapter lvii				32.11438577657008
we can now part come i shall engage your passage and you my dear boy i shall stay here for a few days longer we must accustom ourselves to parting				725.5297963504078
well said he in a voice perfectly calm and no muscle of his countenance disturbed well my dear vampa it appears to me that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony ground arms exclaimed the chief with an imperative sign of the hand while with the other he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this scene he said your pardon your excellency but i was so far from expecting the honor of a visit that i did not really recognize you it seems that your memory is equally short in everything vampa said the count and that not only do you forget people s faces but also the conditions you make with them what conditions have i forgotten your excellency inquired the bandit with the air of a man who having committed an error is anxious to repair it				15.992631823864837
well excellency said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for franz to question him i feared yesterday when i would not promise you anything that you were too late there is not a single carriage to be had that is for the three last days yes returned franz for the very three days it is most needed what is the matter said albert entering no carriage to be had just so returned franz you have guessed it well your eternal city is a nice sort of place that is to say excellency replied pastrini who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian world in the eyes of his guest that there are no carriages to be had from sunday to tuesday evening but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please ah that is something said albert today is thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive replied franz which will make it still more difficult my friend said morcerf let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future at least we can have a window where in the corso ah a window exclaimed signor pastrini utterly impossible there was only one left on the fifth floor of the doria palace and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a day the two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction				921.7375837398193
the axe an ingenious device and well worthy of those who know not what a gentleman is you frighten me not executioner s axe added he touching it with the cane which he held in his hand and i strike you now waiting patiently and christianly for you to return the blow and shrugging his shoulders with unaffected contempt he passed on				91.68302519556553
who could have thought it				14.934060056759
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark				2751.4169988464614
all these cloaks gray or black were raised behind by the point of a sword or before by the barrel of an arquebuse or a musket				129.3871640462466
you lie said the abbÃ© busoni with a tone of irresistible authority				1113.1072390001896
he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead				101.64445023411768
but as i can not and you will not quit this place it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier s gallery he might by chance hear the hollow sound of his footsteps and call the attention of his officer to the circumstance				1036.2415585897918
however when morrel went down to his dinner he appeared very calm				794.1666299510835
two methods of self destruction were at his disposal				109.98485287582534
anne de bueil cried the monk standing up and lifting his hands to heaven				71.51634830360803
all right said caderousse				43.80409124916086
de wardes i know it cried d artagnan				1.0234972237765612
chapter lxxii				151.63434189942572
the office of the king s attorney chapter				1.9972719733046018
god gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you in the name of that god i act remember that wretch and to spare thee at this moment is still serving him oh said caderousse groaning with pain				227.54958349282683
near her was mademoiselle louise d armilly who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy which she intended immediately to make use of				139.0926989455382
one of the two guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after that				175.86067100194933
the acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid them by chance as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey				390.5913440727458
where is he ill very ill say you				19.738219254197393
in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantÃ¨s could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal s hat				896.6178685381433
she could scarcely believe in her happiness and d artagnan was forced to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written				1143.243350320417
the ante rooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards				676.5674496295686
a man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me				21.67566049381496
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that				107.60173327848331
none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity				174.8954531812152
bonacieux was standing at the door and looked at d artagnan hatefully				77.42412907535271
really said planchet				127.5425082446853
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely				260.4227843768752
upon a look from the procurator accompanied by a smile from mme				21.912789572106604
the cardinal was acquainted with the activity and more particularly the hatred of buckingham				260.8146160643294
you are pale and agitated sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor to mademoiselle de la valliere asked athos quickly				98.07368742064074
alone asked athos				3.2572030404302286
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced				171.22299089187655
well three days after that you talked politics with m debray and you fancied from his words that don carlos had returned to spain				6902.807781816739
save my husband				146.27200126046498
he must be the shah of persia travelling incog have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman m lucien inquired eugÃ©nie				43.65873719651992
i go out he said				2.9799863110337323
say on you will permit me to make one remark certainly pray do so then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress indeed said the major regarding himself with an air of complete satisfaction				262.9727912339457
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected				744.6391810152284
you hear me at a quarter past midnight in fact in twenty minutes i understand all perfectly sir replied groslow but allow me to say there is great danger in what you undertake would it not be better to intrust one of the men to set fire to the train my dear groslow answered mordaunt you know the french proverb nothing one does not do one s self is ever well done i shall abide by that rule grimaud had heard all this if he had not understood it				113.99309392724145
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france i am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint jacques				52.284780861047935
i do not suppose that you will all be quite so disinterested as monsieur de la fere replied the cardinal bowing to athos				28.755245419241806
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation				605.0324062033652
this is a woman of twenty six or twenty eight years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall well made				168.4288627526627
for she should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of her character perfecting a beautiful vengeance				355.6769804485904
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us				44.50819681774309
well continued mazarin the time has come to put to use your talents and your valor there was a sudden gleam of joy in the officer s eyes which vanished immediately for he knew nothing of mazarin s purpose				506.7277808456441
war has broken out in flanders				86.7146739653675
no for another for another yes his name his name cried d artagnan				1.0431842796889
oh yes				8.718548073586955
peste edmond you have a very handsome mistress she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed sometimes one and the same thing said morrel with a smile				98.11031139193271
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp				1364.3981110333996
then suddenly pausing he added your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my heart but the rules of etiquette go on go on sir replied the king you have today earned the right to make inquiries here sire interposed the minister of police i came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this head when your majesty s attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty on the contrary sir on the contrary said louis xviii this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention and the death of general quesnel will perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy at the name of general quesnel villefort trembled				336.95941792914994
you will get yourself exiled as you did in the time of louis xiii				1.6942536220740356
as this was the height of d artagnan s worldly ambition apart be it well understood from his desire of finding mme				41.706424985573506
very pretty but to the great astonishment of d artagnan the shutter remained closed				463.3404359142151
what is the matter with my horse your horse is falling said porthos reining in his own				95.26091914839118
we shall descend by the first window in the gallery what next sign your name my lord the duke signed				875.3033089461703
but when he saw the carriage take the way to la grÃªve when he perceived the pointed roof of the hÃ´tel de ville and the carriage passed under the arcade he believed it was over with him				16.48504747371483
i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and i will take m ali as my model by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities				999.9896055628523
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself				134.25925157406112
the deuce it is unlucky for my stomach is getting more and more upset locked repeated mousqueton				129.77037276737994
they galloped on for two or three hours as furiously as the cavaliers on the wall				139.79645253947405
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs				558.4929763661754
porthos maintained a majestic silence				435.15952187420413
special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project gutenbergâ¢ electronic works to protect the project gutenbergâ¢ concept and trademark				447.82799449635485
my dear cousin ah ah said athos				4.34599137681744
and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts				126.93893334075173
i hope madame that the cardinal will not enter into negotiations with such men ah				79.12307736396154

morrel looked around uneasily				156.843014815449
bah said danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love				436.29831813270926
with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of paper i have no money to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest man i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten times the amount				436.39153146467874
