ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may to be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said aramis				115.0895329593292
cause her to lose a hundred thousand francs and that would teach her prudence i do not understand stammered lucien				180148.83658890467
this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of aramis				199.44146454423438
one would say you were carrying me off and they would be right pardieu oh i think you swore eugénie and the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape				1034.5796898206793
and now gentlemen i repeat excuse me but on that account only and on guard at these words with the most gallant air possible d artagnan drew his sword				1156.8668188917877
morrel you are going to destroy yourself indeed count said morrel shuddering what has put this into your head i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hands				372.82502195010227
i do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice my dear d artagnan replied aramis you understand when i was a musketeer i mounted guard as seldom as i could now when i am an abbé i say as few masses as i can				16373.207118323535
where in that box no replied the countess it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the subject of their previous conversation she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious count of monte cristo that gained the prize i am sure of it and who afterwards sent the cup to me undoubtedly but i don t know him said the countess i have a great mind to return it do no such thing i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby				1298290.6424379528
now if you will come on board m morrel said dantès observing the owner s impatience here is your supercargo m danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular				60447.531579196606
d artagnan as we have said had become more tranquil as always happens after a past danger particularly when the danger seems to have vanished				197823.09305127355
has your uneasiness anything to do with what m de blacas has told me and m de villefort has just confirmed m de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect				73065.4566498951
after having been for some time after the death of louis xiii				1356.4314941903447
it was a large cabinet close and stifling with the walls furnished with arms offensive and defensive and in which there was already a fire although it was scarcely the end of the month of september				8221.494578308053
i say that he has hastily accused your majesty s musketeers toward whom he is unjust and that he has not obtained his information from good sources the accusation comes from monsieur de la trémouille from the duke himself				198.84436442552322
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write				4969.317702851866
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes				7525.439280890519
with some gentleman who was traveling this way to whom he proposed a game of lansquenet that s it then and the foolish fellow lost all he had even to his horse monsieur for when the gentleman was about to set out we perceived that his lackey was saddling monsieur porthos s horse as well as his master s				767.5672875535395
these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect				1722166.5290797171
but continued d artagnan how did you escape i took advantage of a moment when they left me alone and as i had known since morning the reason of my abduction with the help of the sheets i let myself down from the window				524.7506727094024
with your idle nonsense yesterday about escaping you worried me so that i dreamed that i was trying to escape and broke my neck in doing so la ramee laughed				4328.731010445984
the officer entered for the fourth time				310.88550880393336
his rider was a priest dressed in black and wearing a three cornered hat and spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity				34224.750005991154
i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so				353.51591478938843
the guards were under arms and d artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades				4178.6869201129175
really said she i believe you now begin to hesitate no i do not hesitate but i really pity this poor comte de wardes since you have ceased to love him				28.803736089695377
we shall then be matched four against the remaining five				5263.131365902186
it was not fatigue that stayed andrea here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some plan				3068.3767695276365
i faith colonel said d artagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast				6630.30477786721
alas my boy said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you will know as much as i do myself				784.8465673732711
there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy				1278330.7379520887
the postscript is explicit i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a way of simplifying the negotiation said franz				425.16602680992145
i have only to say after the little that i have seen and heard that i think even better of you than i have been told raoul bowed				732.2715037309707
the other is on the contrary to all appearance a true nobleman but do you not fear to find him a bully i only fear one thing namely to find a man who will not fight do not be alarmed said beauchamp he will meet you				57.09899142791698
on reaching the door he bowed				679.3317408957296
you will live my lord you will live repeated the faithful servant of anne of austria on his knees before the duke s sofa				13540.21129118064
alas to many the path is traced by tears sir said madame danglars you can feel for my emotion can you not				285.393699540192
take courage sir but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude ah here is m dandré cried de blacas				6543358.629314226
my dear count you can not imagine how my mind is harassed				1882845.2839147432
ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so our master will scold us for it the young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm footing				2220070.493428879
you appear to forget yourself sadly no sir said albert coldly there are circumstances in which one can not except through cowardice i offer you that refuge refuse to admit certain persons at least what is your errand then with me sir i mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplace i mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes that will be sufficient where two men having met one of them will remain on the ground danglars turned pale cavalcanti moved a step forward and albert turned towards him				28.34122436987271
the timely arrival of d artagnan in paris				379.05314887475976
yes where at the louvre are you sure of it perfectly sure who told you of it madame de lannoy who is devoted to your eminence as you know why did she not let me know sooner whether by chance or mistrust the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all day well we are beaten				122718.39678278897
he had again missed his man who had disappeared as if by enchantment				38000.72681307758
yes murmured flamarens lowering his eyes				372.919433395642
adieu brother cried milady				241.96253078217254
go on signor pastrini continued franz smiling at his friend s susceptibility				66591.91821063719
i do not ask you for liberty as a guilty one would nor for vengeance as would a pagan				1844402.0862657093
who sends you no one how did you know i was in prison i recognized you some time since as the insolent dandy who so gracefully mounted his horse in the champs élysées oh the champs élysées				2922.8299270632756
he mentioned this to gaetano who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their boat bread wine half a dozen partridges and a good fire to roast them by				10577.619759732244
but i have nothing to fear while i have you to protect me i do better than that sir i save you you do				914.8293149775626
the soldiers were playing or sleeping two of them were singing in a corner out of tune the psalm on the rivers of babylon d artagnan called the sergeant				7945.067901401566
there is but little reason why i should delay you				53.66178251599894
they were guarded not only by armed men but even by women and children				5185.785506943275
at last there was waterloo and morrel came no more he had done all that was in his power and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly				2100461.692789747
he has he is an abbé ah what a misfortune exclaimed the duchess playing carelessly with her fan				249765.5531284393
d artagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance				5748.676479450197
it is twenty years since i saw them and yet whenever i have seen the king in danger i have thought of them and these men were your friends one of them held my life in his hands and gave it to me				60.98626238758509
speak make haste bind my arms my lord fast why bind thee that i may not be considered as your accomplice your hands asked grimaud				537.1230578466142
most likely replied vampa coolly				19457.279813685935
count she said bragelonne must be a charming place				471.0420088878246
he was accompanied by two of the yacht s crew				88545.14168507267
and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant general the count of morcerf peer of france oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretch to reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me				61.89123737618988
i forgot and he gave some orders in a low voice to one of the horsemen				2537.244196224866
he found beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him beauchamp stopped				2605.2302465415246
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking it it was the noise of cannon				166987.2786247493
are you not a sportsman and a great wolf hunter				2360579.0232124757
but now hasten on board i will join you there ere long so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de justice				1828.5718845797842
death to the guards				3331.2378584483818
she then returned to her room calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her window which was twenty feet from the ground was opened a young peasant jumped into the chamber seized her in his arms and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to the turf of the grass plot where she fainted				3314.8852402382763
what number was it that rang number run waiter at this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled				1856405.4147558927
she felt by intuition the flame of the opposing passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic				45982.72409925626
m dessessart who esteemed d artagnan made him offers of help as this change would entail expenses for equipment				5772.998215839427
there is however a proverb current in france relating to water which is quiet continue said the queen				284.181845441504
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking hours it was then in the silence of night in the dim light shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney piece that she saw the shadows pass and repass which hover over the bed of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings				4021.375747264433
he fancied that they buried the dead at the château d if and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the château frustrated his projects				6063.352585144065
i recognize the coadjutor by his frondist hat and i the duc de beaufort by his white plume of ostrich feathers they are coming full gallop the prince is with them ah				296.2994170699136
this unexpected circumstance brought back richelieu s former anxiety and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the other side of the sea				1041.988220621554
when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon				1681735.216293166
as for my wife i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to one of the most ancient families in france				707.0139627816163
i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced death is it painful to die monte cristo looked upon morrel with indescribable tenderness				2054796.6486629504
did you bet oh merely a paltry fifty louis and who was the winner nautilus				1541076.2006161294
rue de la fontaine				3273022.794360751
rue du helder have you bachelor s apartments there				509.7022018690352
one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened to you lord de winter had said to felton				1166.635399498056
the baroness rose hastily and was going into the study when danglars stopped her				148.14667062263223
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you				66.25895422596604
d artagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the passage				2920.837595502786
why do you not join our party my dear beauchamp				359.2042275300702
three poor gentlemen escorted by a prince of the church				4446.276285617449
read me her letter oh my lord said laporte				143575.13441057852
they expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a fiery outburst				1983379.5779112468
did you come here to fetch me				30.278100920689877
upon my word said caderousse from whose mind the friendly treatment of dantès united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantès good fortune upon my word dantès is a downright good fellow and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be				495.0347641569101
is he still amusing himself in italy i believe so however he regrets your absence extremely				2863848.00542912
it was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood there s only one remedy dear raoul that is to marry her as a compensation remarked d artagnan				82.92901181202974
the drop of water chapter lxiv				103806.65271797508
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else woman woman why do you have such ideas cried caderousse or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man what do you mean added caderousse				817.6202692129756
there he found everything arranged in due order the accusation examination morrel s petition m de villefort s marginal notes				10493.812819468107
greet each other then and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads rochefort and d artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye				1980.1277337564075
shivering for want of a fagot				2619459.6720761433
they found raoul near his tent reclining on a truss of hay of which his horse stole some mouthfuls the young man s eyes were red and he seemed dejected				47882.09372015791
without doubt aramis is one of my best friends aramis				69.39152142627131
this point of union was noirtier and it was he who had just sent for morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of barrois				10879.108014428055
never never cried both the children throwing their arms around their father s neck				4682.099251317563
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart				321.4951947919083
false gentleman cried d artagnan springing forward in his turn after the servant				2554.0877689867766
out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained				12088.018744560508
everyone is free to ask what he pleases that s true replied jacopo i only make a remark well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them no said jacopo but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers that is all i want interrupted dantès				247.57651943852775
as however he did not fall as he did not declare himself conquered but only broke away toward the hôtel of m de la trémouille in whose service he had a relative d artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound his adversary had received and pressing him warmly without doubt would soon have completed his work with a third blow when the noise which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court two of the friends of the guardsman who had seen him go out after exchanging some words with d artagnan rushed sword in hand from the court and fell upon the conqueror				1073649.1143557436
spaniards englishmen and italian malcontents adventurers of all nations and soldiers of fortune of every sect flocked at the first summons under the standard of the protestants and organized themselves like a vast association whose branches diverged freely over all parts of europe				29657.860845125
he thanked the governor bowed and departed				16133.4823178946
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis chapter v the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards chapter vi				3196.061315835894
porthos bowed				681.8325420208141
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans				1473215.6800015825
bonacieux to join her				111.27760516506429
he left there three men				866.4346204877418
the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand in whom the grand vizier ali tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence well said monte cristo what do you see in that to annoy you what do i see in it yes what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up by a french officer it signifies to my father the count of morcerf whose christian name is fernand did your father serve under ali pasha yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny oh my dear viscount do talk reason i do not desire to do otherwise now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the officer fernand and the count of morcerf are one and the same person				1110.7001455746772
the duke had followed with anxiety la ramee s unspoken soliloquy reading it from point to point upon his face				321.27298538025855
come it is worth thinking about for fifteen thousand francs yes sir you alarm me nonsense sir you are tempting me just so fifteen thousand francs do you understand sir let me see my right hand correspondent on the contrary do not look at him but at this what is it what				536.580613167995
pardon cried felton oh pardon milady read in his eyes love				922.602082717171
the lantern was placed on the ground the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began				3862.0377337433897
he is a priest said bragelonne he has worn the tonsure				1655974.9925485812
besides are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud mousqueton and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos porthos and aramis yes monsieur said planchet and i will go as soon as you please				37219.979620930564
he is here who milady s son athos again struck by this name which seemed to pursue him like an echo hesitated for a moment then slightly knitting his brows he calmly said i know it grimaud met him between bethune and arras and then came here to warn me of his presence does grimaud know him then no but he was present at the deathbed of a man who knew him the headsman of bethune exclaimed de winter				827.2585126856578
this look of porthos s made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning				909169.9532890087
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back				1124.933629289905
no its odor charms one of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it				37.7428372979122
and how did he look asked porthos who perceiving that d artagnan had allowed the conversation to drop profited by it to put in a word or two				1577.3162267173795
oh oh replied d artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution we must fly said the queen				339.8714659743927
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so				346.1358478054268
d aguillon his mistress and mme				154.8311291155175
he found her in a charming humor				2791.5503400431644
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day				295.224344621541
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden				2544.2346562589746
the cardinal as his majesty had said was really furious so furious that during eight days he absented himself from the king s gaming table				641.1433207489466
she saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan				3097.882470212385
that would be too terrible calm yourself sir replied de guiche				9571.195928005947
if this man should ever discover the names of the others my master is lost haste				1658.1089992690606
he will amass wealth he will injure the king s revenue and pay to himself the pensions which richelieu paid to others				1163.2225241213323
i mean that all these cries all these complaints these curses produce nothing but storms and flashes and that is all but the lightning will not strike until there is a hand to guide it my friend said gondy you seem to be a clever and a thoughtful man are you disposed to take a part in a little civil war should we have one and put at the command of the leader should we find one your personal influence and the influence you have acquired over your comrades yes sir provided this war were approved of by the church and would advance the end i wish to attain i mean the remission of my sins the war will not only be approved of but directed by the church				4525.314342953902
he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve and which had the postmark marseilles february delivery o clock p m but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be				490.6463157121239
refer to your papers you are not busoni you are not monte cristo				299.34513750997627
the anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer in spite of his efforts to suppress it terrified his sensitive inamorata				1741041.6883312415
i do not wish to be taken by surprise added the king				529.6277272692232

you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me come now said athos you are joking in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats i observed cannon on the road i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said i supposed said athos that last night s conferences would modify those warlike arrangements no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair perhaps you speak the truth aramis well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with d artagnan porthos and possibly even raoul				1645.7406053371305
i was arrested and became a prisoner because under the arbor of la réserve the day before i was to marry you a man named danglars wrote this letter which the fisherman fernand himself posted monte cristo went to a secretaire opened a drawer by a spring from which he took a paper which had lost its original color and the ink of which had become of a rusty hue this he placed in the hands of mercédès				3173.2223381218014
suddenly the daylight began to fade away franz took out his watch it was half past four				4930.9377126009

that s exactly what my wife said monseigneur do you know who carried off your wife no monseigneur you have suspicions nevertheless yes monseigneur but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary and i no longer have them your wife has escaped				8553.584883427613

his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door on the lookout for guests who seldom came yet there he stood day after day exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the manner of the spanish muleteers				1887528.692249637

i confined myself then to begging him to give up his chamber which is the handsomest in the hôtel and to be satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor but to this monsieur porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress who was one of the greatest ladies in the court i might easily comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage				5074416.298265226
and now where is he gone inquired d artagnan				4.189124571663697
the judges themselves appeared to be stupefied and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion				19005.573630177852

all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the windows				2040.3629506048424
come let me show you my plan the abbé then showed dantès the sketch he had made for their escape				1027.143506542986

this time the marshal charged but he was welcomed by musket shots while stones fell like hail from all the windows				2038.5181542028115
but fortunately the world is a sepulcher the men and consequently the women are but shadows and love is a sentiment to which you cry fie				2266542.667158405
the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away				551.7913337312673
why the devil does that foolish girl who pretends to wish to speak to me not come into my study				983.5641869232745
aim at this command the mountain of populace thinned so suddenly that d artagnan could not repress a burst of homeric laughter				1944.901429061503
i was not aware that you were so intimate with her who told you we were intimate maximilian no one but you appeared to be so				348.95593714662635
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes				1957619.6671974426
no you are right my dear rochefort it couldn t be for that but you will probably learn the reason soon ah indeed				867.1781930233175
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his attention and drew the perspiration to his brow then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a moment placed his foot on the first step				2128.7657979835562
d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen				57381.9025093315
tis a rondeau by monsieur voiture that monsieur l abbé is repeating to me said athos in a loud voice and i confess i think it incomparable raoul stayed only a few minutes near them and then mingled with the group round madame de chevreuse				2343.2173614410035
ah this time you can not lose ground my fine friend exclaimed d artagnan				8.747531141996323

nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold				4523.28642972112

why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me				46.330010168091576
indeed this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children my dear athos i admire you but nevertheless we were in the wrong after all how in the wrong said athos				205.05484366867393
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a man s head inside the carriage				554.1731739490033
as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in				578.3523233764292
he remembered that morcerf had been taxed at crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than morcerf he fixed his own price at crowns				2714.136188599249

with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered andrea s attentions in order to get rid of morcerf but when andrea urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him				30.158461494875514
you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me				51.55745463316364
things passed as on the night before				1176.1190732884447
ali appeared				1026.1888790616579

then d artagnan rushed out of his hiding place and arrived in time to see bazin turn down the rue de la juiverie and enter in the rue de la calandre a respectable looking house and this d artagnan felt no doubt was the habitation of the worthy beadle				70173.94829624523
one day when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome				863.6680616501692
but once started he could not stop				3713.6391228908465
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers				7284.562965567221

d artagnan and porthos armed with their swords and athos and aramis each carrying a concealed poniard approached the house which for the time being was charles stuart s prison				1905.7963277511562
i love you as one loves a father brother husband				1638.9289829264499
your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl				1322.1097857957218

cromwell gazed a moment after him				26.319608102240764
why you sell yourself body and soul to the demon the devil for money no to the cardinal it s the same thing cried the young woman				956.2924843725497

this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d artagnan who however placed himself between him and them				83.52572648116627
oh good lord				621.654511683426

bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight				4989.352288810554
a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the world at large the major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm manner at the same time casting his eyes down either to give himself time to compose his countenance or to assist his imagination all the while giving an under look at the count the protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity				1667.2741269286198

every one arose				3170.856715796749
hey yes thank god i am pretty well said mousqueton				690.4002484505444
instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a letter				629.750047347605
the author of this history who has resided five or six years in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those events so common in other countries				17577.097824301738

mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of henry iv when shall we two walk together athos then said to aramis				191.41678712891894

after some search i found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the head of the bed and at the hearth yes said the count yes i raised the stones and found a rope ladder and some tools how do you know that asked the guide in astonishment				1241.7383575773695
her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but the children of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of daylight				44686.17262267967
from whom comes this letter from her majesty as i think from her majesty said buckingham becoming so pale that d artagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal				3222.4771850833054
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way				510.68943311473566
almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their arms either a cross in honor of their mission or birds of passage in sign of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith				2158.328188790785
he again ran back to the château				1160924.701204889
it was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on buckingham their courage would fail with their hope				1504.0833917048726
un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin it doesn t surprise me said d artagnan in a low tone to porthos that mazarin would have been much better satisfied had i crushed the life out of his councillor you understand then monsieur resumed planchet that if it were for some enterprise like that undertaken against monsieur broussel that you should ask me to take my carbine no don t be alarmed but where did you get all these details from a good source sir i heard it from friquet from friquet				6300.957941053581
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her				153.7025740648178
fire fire cried mordaunt returning to the group surrounding the two friends				325.84126047730524

his eminence then orders me said the lady				4994.546205262197
the first words exchanged between the four friends on account of the ceremony which each of them mingled with their demonstration were somewhat forced and even the repast began with a kind of stiffness				1561378.7269125741
planchet art thou there cried mousqueton with open arms and eyes full of tears				1023.9638873279548
in his most simple actions as well as in his most secret thoughts i find a relation to my own				698.6537264442057
bazin cried the four young men calling their lackeys clean my boots and fetch the horses from the hôtel each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel as at a barrack his own horse and that of his lackey				5337.638494973825

morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word				531.3886220509537
well that has happened friend porthos				22.393710667070135
these were all who were left of the little troop				120973.08529498901
porthos drew his sword from the scabbard and made passes at the wall springing back from time to time and making contortions like a dancer				157581.65556050852
but it has none in fact the side of the letter opposite the seal was blank				1625440.7348376517
oh no he exclaimed not die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much				1608.0387349211287
let her believe that we are in search of some conspiracy or other				759.8467149683547
only one minute mr felton and you will have saved my honor to kill yourself cried felton with terror forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner to kill yourself i have told sir murmured milady lowering her voice and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground i have told my secret				2186.3830277070488

lucien had found time preparatory to the count s arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to madame danglars				397.12875939856906
i am on the earth to punish madame he added with a flaming glance any other woman were it the queen herself i would send to the executioner but to you i shall be merciful				84108.81348770123

only remember on the of october morrel i shall expect you at the island of monte cristo				356.12959138743366
sir replied he if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the point and not have entertained me with the idle conversation to which i have been patiently listening for the last half hour				1384.1988140749256
i married that woman when she was a young girl i married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family i gave her my wealth i gave her my name and one day i discovered that this woman was branded this woman was marked with a fleur de lis on her left shoulder oh said milady raising herself i defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me				74.24250332391412
hem said the king				391.99220366726644
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts				1957.1005412696495
you wish to destroy yourself said the count you have written it well said morrel changing his expression of calmness for one of violence well and if i do intend to turn this pistol against myself who shall prevent me who will dare prevent me				66.35833091615926
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy				1470.762402112979
and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner the name of m noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange the father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics				5816.567640832576
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him				27.921612101025314
well you can ask my servant or rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow it was the talk of the house and this elixir where is it				57.97356137023508
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable				164285.22281868587
no no i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him				30.364112875941483
franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised and began accordingly but at the first words he was interrupted				114749.19495364274
often before his captivity dantès mind had revolted at the idea of assemblages of prisoners made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers				86073.0194783342

still more he has lifted the corner of her mask that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong				11548.314527154947
i know it and now the ranks began to open				3755.1610747517157
faith you are indeed right not to return to it				49.932659479142856
i am getting more and more seasick go in then grimaud said mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet				2568446.8885773597
all the crowd gave way before morrel				399.2075468235384
how is your husband our dear monsieur coquenard				4728157.791002509
on tuesday all those who through want of money time or enthusiasm have not been to see the carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the noise and excitement				4686.655968985705
d artagnan politely begged the swiss to yield to him the disputed chamber the swiss refused by shaking his head and drew his sword				1159.605624064703
porthos had his fits				4055454.4503378095
his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was for andrea				1565.525858585531
there is no question you understand provided we secure our own interests of securing those of the frondeurs who besides don t understand political matters as we old soldiers do never fear dear friend said porthos				99.18618014771882
and you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity curiosity that is a terrible word why so				338.3305062173848
the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness				21988.079172218524
it is upon one higher placed than i am that god has laid this responsibility to you no to you alone				849.7066452556705
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary				4940.003067232791
is it not so madame oh my god my god murmured the queen whose teeth chattered with fright				12395.832238871448
exactly opposite the other				773.7788623296481
your fortune exceeds francs does it not asked he				16.316182579019546
go and see those whom you love and who love you and tell my sister de longueville that i thank her for the present that she made me of you and i came sir added raoul gazing at the count with a smile of real affection for i thought you would be glad to see me again athos drew the young man toward him and pressed his lips to his brow as he would have done to a young daughter				4069.849552909049
sign it then caderousse signed it				39.444526268907765
well for my part said athos i found aramis s spanish wine so good that i sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the lackeys				11903.392289660887
as soon as the earnest money was paid d artagnan took possession of his lodging and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken off an almost new doublet of the elder m d artagnan and which she had given her son secretly				44001.0142676565
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles				93005.63692406303
and driving the coadjutor s carriage said the queen				251.95178685230843
but i shall have a priest of vulgar mind whose career and fortune i have ruined by my misfortune				1486.0599275368666
we are now on the sea at night without any pilot in a frail bark should a blast of wind upset the boat we are lost mousqueton heaved a deep sigh				1855.2176742653953
three days passed seventy two long tedious hours which he counted off by minutes				2561.398207636517
however in an hour i shall know all				314.4694449706208
you had already passed half your life in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated crime under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my hands a fortune brilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any				15533.495556064358
the count soon heard andrea s voice singing a corsican song accompanied by the piano				1332640.1089235074
you do not know my mother she it is whom you see here				611.7193469419414
four years ago penelon was at trieste penelon count is the old sailor you saw in the garden and who from quartermaster has become gardener penelon when he was at trieste saw on the quay an englishman who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of june and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of september				7384.685590536904
you notice my ring said the gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his friends				310.56917369028133
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin that s all very well replied d artagnan but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful woman a woman of mark said porthos with his loud laugh				769.5546990259124
a moment after caderousse s face appeared at the grating in the door				199.1988191569183
franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel				4413.013213735463
my dear mr mordaunt said mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare how extremely your history interests me				73.54765610503735
die cried mademoiselle paulet bitterly he				117.38980557580496
you are going to kill the son as you killed the mother				1096.1605447416655
yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent i might have prevented benedetto from killing you but i found you proud and blood thirsty and i left you in the hands of god i do not believe there is a god howled caderousse you do not believe it you lie you lie silence said the abbé you will force the last drop of blood from your veins				7914.711933633235
no you do all this not i still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders				1132.166672317975
his majesty king louis xiii				1304.7772216981664
bonacieux wept all day like a true mercer not being at all a military man as he himself informed us				243.96750167114655
you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he				194.31660463724626
the king went away enchanted				2715709.3589008693
yes my good friend this worthy porthos has just received a sword wound and i am taking him to his country house at saint cloud oh				944.506181304017
let us try and overtake this gentleman said raoul to olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company it was about four o clock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them				72.77518074897628
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england she was young you say twenty five years old beautiful ravishingly blond yes abundance of hair falling over her shoulders yes eyes of an admirable expression when she chose				1221603.1250741119
has the corsican ogre broken loose cried a third				50294.172429470775
provoked by a complete refusal she bit her lip and said then shall i send valentine to you the old man closed his eyes eagerly thereby intimating that such was his wish				2252.536949650783
they carried valentine away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the attack				4853.018618608407
we shall try to persuade the great d aguesseau m de villefort to come but have not much hope of seeing him never despair of anything says the proverb do you dance count i dance yes you it would not be astonishing that is very well before one is over forty				2162570.6864958587
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd				7720.006699769673
bending on one knee he placed it reverently by the side of its mother with its head upon her breast				1188.2947579606268
at that instant the moon inquisitive perhaps like d artagnan came from behind a cloud and by her light d artagnan recognized the large blue eyes the golden hair and the classic head of the duchess de longueville				3922.478142895868
tell m nortier resumed villefort that what he demands is impossible then m nortier gives notice to these gentlemen replied barrois that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing room astonishment was at its height				19889.198066568446
danglars then opened the window				523.7272687479536
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt				111861.43674888814
just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe now entirely deserted				4233.11624899074
midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl				1312.0049630630629
mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father now a madman and her brother who died last september with his mother				1113.272851837757
in the name of heaven cried he listen to me i have been waiting for someone who has not come				622.4111595410855
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy you alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone yes that s true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more i don t doubt				3256.373297001043
felton then had spoken in her favor since lord de winter had not been willing to listen to him				28.187453360968558
well said beauchamp here is my answer my dear sir				533.3895670963165
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina				14757.861070136845
have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave				11826.00886717723
but that s more than dislike that s ingratitude				3565105.676436531
does madame de morcerf dance never you can talk to her she so delights in your conversation indeed yes truly and i assure you				55.480242907380465
without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that d artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos				188.07560999571254
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the red tinted horizon				2574.472025852169
leaving the church a woman and a young girl dressed in black the one as a widow and the other as an orphan have re entered their cell				2513.572040230501
the contract was to have been signed three days since we shall find it all ready and can sign it today but the mourning said franz hesitating				1786663.8573467175
his confidence had unveiled the sinister project of the queen				442.68451511256774
well said he to me have you made your mind up to take the oath i requested of you you have said puritans have but one word				516.5649164158096
a dinner in the old style				98094.60309320646
are there any others yes the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons let us visit them said the inspector with an air of fatigue				13126.03853032107
do you suppose i carry francs in my pocket your excellency has francs in your pocket that will be fifty fowls at francs apiece and half a fowl for the danglars shuddered				3146.333938816363
raoul had desired to be awakened should grimaud arrive but grimaud did not arrive				9078.113736383133
the initials are only mine c				4644438.453647563
i asked said athos in the same language if there are two parliaments a pure and an impure why how extraordinary said porthos slowly raising his head and looking at his friends with an air of astonishment i understand english then				857.6799198555988
he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him				28.814176346999723
well monsieur de busigny i will bet you said athos that my three companions messieurs porthos aramis and d artagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion st gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us porthos and aramis looked at each other they began to comprehend				10778.748316442212
hardly had d artagnan seen through a crevice in his closet that the whole apartment was in obscurity than he slipped out of his concealment at the very moment when kitty reclosed the door of communication				45622.534152745335
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the château d if were interred in an ordinary burial ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman				1251.324076625481
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men				865.0240424889861
but tell me count will your people take care of my horse do not alarm yourself my dear maximilian they understand i mean because he wants petting				2024673.1662835947
then his two guides took his arms and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel				4526.2034595564755
he was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment				388.6606375663064
is it not so eh who knows				5034.679113910163
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling				2472.0741279821673
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious				116554.11987845403
this feeling lasted but for a moment				377.9374185178523
i want to find out who was the man in the mask who so obligingly offered to cut the king s throat a man in a mask cried athos				122.40566135981325
you say you have nothing to do with my cash box				974.3430589909303
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it				45.20355902419199
monsieur aramis become a poet i beg of you bazin my friend said aramis i believe you meddle with my conversation bazin perceived he was wrong he bowed and went out				356.26139284900154
this man was our old acquaintance gaspard caderousse				642.4476283867151
now sir said d artagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier				196376.67733131722
dantès listened and plainly distinguished the approaching steps of the jailer				3072.4645100252515
what are you meddling with stupid				2555809.464048826
i made the tour of the room at least twenty times in search of an outlet of some kind but there was none				4036.337323076081
at that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the corridor				10199.56786005777
caderousse drew a deep breath				2450.458474292536
the nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question				1320.8847956427894
the servant returned with a message to say that though the duchess had not the honor of knowing monsieur de la fere she would receive him				29.47445455887123
but hold out your glass				1459.7135304043113
yes indeed to you i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied monte cristo amid the general outburst of amazement				2206.414015905919
the image of devastation and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over a field of battle of fifty large sausages suspended from the joists scarcely ten remained				11828.43392038344
two held poor assunta who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners				2815028.4910910698
you are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject				2825.781819852193
athos had been out since six o clock				1164.817731967222
alone asked d artagnan				4.89289392276365
my sporting dogs consist of two pointers two harriers and two setters				1719235.7243794631
the woman who was outside the window turned round and passed within four steps of d artagnan pulling down the hood of her mantle but the precaution was too late d artagnan had already recognized mme				200.0074519695997
well cried the three musketeers all together on seeing d artagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger				1269.4341663966723
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal francs which i spent in four or five months it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in paris amongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just now it was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place				463.1449470913277
gentlemen you see said the duke to those present who dared not even smile that it is the illustrious coxcomb who is the greatest thief in the world at least according to pistache let us go on to another of his exercises gentlemen there was a profound silence in the room when the duke again addressed them do you not remember that the duc de guise taught all the dogs in paris to jump for mademoiselle de pons whom he styled the fairest of the fair pistache is going to show you how superior he is to all other dogs				43510.12460409181
barrois cried valentine barrois i am coming mademoiselle replied he				14.377776938220679
to paris first i have affairs to settle and they both set out for paris				397.04696182015
the request was granted and three months afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies of the sea a small village sprang up				1106.9071207927827
chapter xvi				5130.655855969695
but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of henry iv				1013.4531473580964
directly afterwards the moon rose				3745.9186449293834
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the louvre at one o clock this morning she had not returned my god				474.9230043080947
why does the boat go so fast asked i of my mother				952.9004339496031
the celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the count s possession				1832.2429064823652
this great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for this man who a rather improbable thing had stolen his father s letter from him was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred				4895.836749760113
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spin i feel very keenly fernand that this is charity and if it were mercédès poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of marseilles				1209.1967354123517
important and urgent said he				22.548827719499492
what says augustine on this subject severus sit clericorum verbo yes let the sermon be clear said the curate				17311.07705314717
i know these lovers				19244.300293320535
if i knew that he did i should know all the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of raoul				1805.522407467854
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to milady				806.4444838956215
without passports he murmured				2986.8029506144394
here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this affair				1675.7610085783049
danglars who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his eye to the crack of the door and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide				8094.904421176566
my dear sir if a trifle like that could suffice me i should never have given myself the trouble of opening an account				1888.6205800298114
what do you desire a bed my lord replied d artagnan				3.8958928619191897
athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was				566.7866682463552
to be decapitated				3089198.769966181
as for me i feel anxious to preach a sermon said d artagnan				10.558092059330006
gold a devoted friend and a letter from the king our husband and master de winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of emotion				3909.761490732363
he felt in the pocket and drew from it a paper it was the letter of aramis monsieur d artagnan you know that i have had a quarrel with a certain gentleman who has given me an appointment for this evening in the place royale				18810.468105621883
in the shadow was a carriage with two horses and some saddlehorses				114725.8880152309
then d artagnan disposed to become the most tender of lovers was at the same time a very devoted friend				331.7059254957677
now we may say at last thank heaven				887.183293461294
monsieur is going to marry me replied the hostess between two gasps				7108535.70112323
but there are no more said she				112.96585335677527
i know the french as well as if i had made them myself				738.0204109436527
at about a league and a half from the city d artagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing time				305.321103541748
on saturday i will tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph at the door the count was met by the two notaries who had just completed the act which was to disinherit valentine and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a thing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit				4197.935344473231
three replied aramis smiling				580.3441182285004
why it is poor lubin the lackey of the comte de wardes he whom you took such good care of a month ago at calais on the road to the governor s country house so it is said d artagnan i know him now				1641.7455899807815
d artagnan had calculated that in not going at once to the palais royal he would give comminges time to arrive before him and consequently to make the cardinal acquainted with the eminent services which he d artagnan and his friend had rendered to the queen s party in the morning				699.9001294062003
i will return soon to learn the result of your trip the stranger went out				395.532781218458
baron have you any report more recent than this dated the february and this is the of march no sire but i am hourly expecting one it may have arrived since i left my office go thither and if there be none well well continued louis xviii make one that is the usual way is it not and the king laughed facetiously				1648303.3967035771
as he approached he seemed to recognize the features of this individual				251080.26464867842
no and yet they refused to buy it why said château renaud				1477.3258755408883
well beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts in the whole army oh m de morcerf interrupted morrel				458.741391147083
and now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman which faria had related to him now open sesame chapter				328.00092671009907
nevertheless day dawned without darkness having brought any accident				2534.454601587323
the next day athos leaning out of his window which looked upon the most populous part of the city heard the act of parliament which summoned the ex king charles i to the bar publicly cried				2052.6253754129402
well asked the president what do you say to this letter general i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii				1212.9226221789652
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousse s murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends				12064.743027573477
well here we are at last said one of them				62.551435678777025

coward he is a coward indeed grumbled the host drawing near to d artagnan and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters with the young man as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had despised the evening before				1243.5135778599758
well what is it what is going on here said he in a jeering voice on seeing the prisoner sitting up and felton about to go out				350.99405003346766

this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob not a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarin s witticisms or by the jests of the multitude seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place				469.0637637957208

franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent				217651.06940582182
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought d artagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence there reigned a perfect stillness in the house				407.293817705821

d artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet				978.0296715129747
he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner				27092.214725578702
the count leaned over her and raised her in his arms and seeing that sweet pale face those lovely eyes closed that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless the idea occurred to him for the first time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father				1047.139424329718

if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel				78230.06571063583

the host gave them another chamber and served them with fresh eggs and some water which athos went himself to draw at the fountain				854531.7891118333

as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard				542.6232936422589
as long as the procurator s wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself				893.259428664036

the count s tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere				6151.475497799919
in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person				1174.3051080716843

the two brigands looked at each other for a moment the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips the other with the pallor of death on his brow				1692.160843265353
the four young men standing and motionless followed him with their eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared				393.91579227097714
where on the balcony not at all madame but here sleeping in his bed oh your majesty exclaimed laporte monsieur d artagnan is right the queen became thoughtful and smiled like a woman to whom duplicity is no stranger				2811.364758165452
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwell s				783.9840349949437
so at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting				7341.675496280528
he repaired therefore immediately to his hôtel and caused himself to be announced				1380.8116926651696

i do not often laugh sir replied the stranger as you may perceive by the expression of my countenance but nevertheless i retain the privilege of laughing when i please and i cried d artagnan will allow no man to laugh when it displeases me indeed sir continued the stranger more calm than ever well that is perfectly right and turning on his heel was about to re enter the hostelry by the front gate beneath which d artagnan on arriving had observed a saddled horse				937.6422974502088

when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly francs and have those francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrel s correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision				64826.74284851448

you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo				280.44411555254374

dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire				2801030.8973844266
they are robbers perhaps he muttered				7416.303867087479
a great age you mean monsieur porthos				51.989657153164586
the prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours he had passed in vain hopes prayer and despondency				1990863.1871726334

five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince s door				171.32614019614434
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d artagnan				37.898102571284504
he was the worst musketeer and the most unconvivial companion imaginable				21595.90390475635

d artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with lord de winter and then returned to milady				794.3862994583926
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetano s description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself				194.64572407521604
accustomed however as he was to the work he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find every word in the dictionary so that it was ten minutes before the thought of the old man was translated by these words fetch the glass of water and the decanter from valentine s room morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barrois s situation and in noirtier s name gave that order				4327.084172154728

no only add two bottles of champagne and the difference will be for the napkins the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for but he made amends by slipping in two bottles of anjou wine instead of two bottles of champagne				88152.25713836998
but the third time which is the present you may succumb				2802265.296607633
she would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly madame danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy				13962.485035916601
that i am exceedingly disquieted sire really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine no sire for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not a thing to be feared then of what other scourge are you afraid my dear blacas sire i have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the south well my dear duke replied louis xviii i think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that direction man of ability as he was louis xviii				1190.281864891244

i love you so tenderly that i can not help being jealous even of the past a smile which was indefinable passed over the lips of the queen				439.4984680999952
morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say here i am maximilian come and help me he had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the clover field a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone without a servant without lights at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions				28108.72904402698
still in spite of this reciprocal politeness the countenances of the women betrayed a certain amount of uneasiness louvieres became very pale and waited impatiently for the officer to explain himself				195.5822387227497
and the duke furious against the cardinal				385.4029600221364

blancmesnil and broussel seemed in the highest favor				1106.239109355777
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed				693.214776704084
my dear athos you know that i am not alluding to you you are the pearl of brave bold men				864.0989422560145
he had assigned himself the task of saving a man s life that day chance caused that man to be myself				793.3570289274193
now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery				155168.91149567955
there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flower beds no fine lady ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinière with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure				1162289.504314983
we dined so very late hastily interposed la carconte				3725.565098292614

without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance				4473.855569643027
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind				673.1907313359235
and even if she were to be seriously offended i could well understand it your majesty has treated her with a severity it is thus i will always treat my enemies and yours duke however high they may be placed and whatever peril i may incur in acting severely toward them the queen is my enemy but is not yours sire on the contrary she is a devoted submissive and irreproachable wife				892.9553597776062
then he went into the stable he found the five horses saddled his own amongst the rest				843.6535690939528
it was about nine o clock in the morning				702.2623020975518
then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the jesuit entreated me to get him made a musketeer without a thesis cried d artagnan without a thesis				278727.42624430894
sir said he you are aware that valentine is about to enter her nineteenth year which renders it important that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance				5271.842055327405

the host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they wished				21969.54997554364
she asked upon what day this fête would take place but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head				439.35849816731917
ah then you wish to ask advice of me yes i do wish to ask your advice said madame danglars with anxious expectation				68027.18330012959
she knew she had only two days left that when once the order was signed by buckingham and buckingham would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name and he could not therefore recognize the woman in question once this order was signed we say the baron would make her embark immediately and she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose beauty is lighted by the sun of the world whose style the voice of fashion lauds and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting splendors				1612297.8072787262
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips				408.971572589585
that s it				46.2232088058151
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majesty s service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me				76.98952814746715
well insisted the count				154.4288403349213

when the ladies had finished their supper the queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom				7040.981044521782
the young man and young woman perceived they were watched and redoubled their speed				2443.0009870284402
you see then why i must decline your polite invitation which is especially attractive to me because nothing is so wearisome as to play night after night with the same person the chances always balance and at the month s end nothing is gained or lost ah said groslow sighing there is something still more wearisome and that is not to play at all i can understand that said d artagnan				145.28908297111374
a dead horse said d artagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours i seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed porthos leaning over his horse s mane				1767049.724932807
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures				3430.655893193772

athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not d artagnan				141.62472674889506
the count of monte cristo continued the servant begs these gentlemen s permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will please to receive him faith franz whispered albert there is not much to find fault with here tell the count replied franz that we will do ourselves the pleasure of calling on him the servant bowed and retired				1203.119807589148
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask				3592.6607711418505
the young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the owner				25189.005858114393

now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever				2105.496439812381
here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm				1695.184519582111
a night is soon passed and tomorrow to the wheel to the gallows				1369722.0171911938
monsieur said athos placing his hand on d artagnan s shoulder monsieur is the chevalier d artagnan of whom you have often heard me speak raoul monsieur said the young man saluting again and more profoundly monsieur le comte has pronounced your name before me as an example whenever he wished to speak of an intrepid and generous gentleman that little compliment could not fail to move d artagnan				154.52290394243562
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat				3304.4881883589983
nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos than i have but i like better to hear my sword clang against lances than against staves				1801667.9669124943
oh yes				1194.9393568083526
tell me why does a steward rob his master because i suppose it is his nature to do so for the love of robbing you are mistaken it is because he has a wife and family and ambitious desires for himself and them				75.84942564472621
a table which had been covered with an elegant supper was overturned				1699439.387955896
during this time the empire made its last conscription and every man in france capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor				9660.118776542984
and we did not surrender no				267.447800227909

perhaps so				303.5037663312068
edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps				2098.433273952886
what does the angel of light or the angel of darkness say to that mind at once implacable and generous				15400.080115950805

go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets villefort went immediately				1643.394306645527
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled one				1223.0391454646535
his first visit was to aramis at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed mme				192.7239933294488

the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day				296.74777567479816
edmond fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths				2499138.815245328
when he had gained the angle of the street he turned				114039.53446558739
listen to me				43.59607806204082
oh no no cried milady no sir do not call him i conjure you				67.82658527307088
bonacieux holding out her hand to him and placing the other upon the knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall				455.6769931696795
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are mine				1077.3820119051766
i was deceived as it appears and i ask your pardon and what did monsieur d artagnan reply monsieur d artagnan promised me his assistance but i soon found out that he was betraying me you impose upon justice				1813.14918165545
i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the count				267.60572780026973
d artagnan had heard the door shut and the shutters barred the dogs became in their turn silent				2516.956666110546
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility				14541.412577769417
she ground her teeth she was of the color of ashes				14376.893938822974
he must be apprehended do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well				533.7157306145219
what do you mean				3316.2954892620805
bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event he attributed it i believe to a political cause i doubted from the first and now i think entirely as he does				9654.427062741046
this person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with flowers				1041.8809046686176
confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a deep heavy slumber				18612.341516280943
by the torchlight dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes				71347.5128806154
the dog performed three evolutions around the circle and laid himself with the deepest respect at the feet of monsieur de chavigny who at first seemed inclined to like the joke and laughed long and loud but a frown succeeded and he bit his lips with vexation				69988.88271514657
in fact the minister who in the plenitude of his power had been unable to unearth napoleon s secret might in despair at his own downfall interrogate dantès and so lay bare the motives of villefort s plot				42377.39269732764
yes i will accompany you but did you not read that i must be alone said julie				10835.547303340447
it does not concern me you are right and if i have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the french captain or the count of morcerf but on the fisherman fernand the husband of mercédès the catalane ah sir cried the countess how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit for i am the only culprit edmond and if you owe revenge to anyone it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude but exclaimed monte cristo why was i absent				4329.56085809663
he returned to mousqueton but the steward had sold the last wisp				1927004.9353393223
should the king prove a tyrant for power begets tyranny serve love respect royalty that divine right that celestial spark which makes this dust still powerful and holy so that we gentlemen nevertheless of rank and condition are as nothing in comparison with the cold corpse there extended i shall adore god sir said raoul respect royalty and ever serve the king				534.7782876158597
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry				6344.015098324514
cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend s entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to rita s father at frosinone				138014.95669135792
did edmond make you his heir no merely his testamentary executor				2072360.7821603154
and so dantès after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven				539.2456111287381
to your house dear porthos at pierrefonds your fine chateau is worthy of affording its princely hospitality to his eminence it is likewise well situated neither too near paris nor too far from it we can establish a communication between it and the capital with great facility				1198043.7324295517
albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz d épinay to pass a fortnight at venice				25676.679136109182
and i also said aramis				19.213014038416926
d artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three his paleness terrified athos who however consented himself with saying that s a sad throw comrade you will have the horses fully equipped monsieur the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice				5694.037394711033
monseigneur au revoir monsieur bonacieux au revoir and the cardinal made him a sign with his hand to which bonacieux replied by bowing to the ground				1263.514126527663
she believed the order ready for execution				5755.731126097804
i never had one				883.2779302177295
as soon as he appeared in the count of morcerf s antechamber a footman the same who at rome had brought the count s card to the two young men and announced his visit sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him				31.805070316067063
at this time that is about half past twelve madame danglars ordered her carriage and went out				361.25103238257844
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the vessel which rose gracefully as it expanded in the air and then franz heard a slight report				9303.450933266324
sir you will perhaps think that i am in a great hurry to leave you when i have only just arrived but have you only two days of leave raoul on the contrary sir i have ten nor is it to the camp i wish to go where then said athos smiling if it be not a secret				2186.225608525276
the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other				775.2945835059971
look at this lady raoul she is an historic personage it was to visit her king henry iv				1028.0529409467802
i will continue then resumed aramis				64.95319632815502
there was once in the rue des tournelles a house known by all the sedan chairmen and footmen of paris and yet nevertheless this house was neither that of a great lord nor of a rich man				130.96203782265783
this is the order he said				298.2258785310677
but when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain d artagnan who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an explanation				6053.738196282904
on perceiving monte cristo she arose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love				926.5359496401942
albert and château renaud exchanged a second look more full of amazement than the first				1011.8278254236576
eugénie bowed coldly to the count and availed herself of the first moment when the conversation became earnest to escape to her study whence very soon two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars preferred to his society and to that of m cavalcanti the company of mademoiselle louise d armilly her singing teacher				2137918.2475472526
the ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with teresa in his arms				616.371619170816
the pope therefore blesses with the fingers				3218.536688748686
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors				2840166.0951964837
but nothing escaped the count s notice and he observed a little note passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the hand of madame danglars to that of the minister s secretary				19783.374623500295
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into truly athos interrupted d artagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of				9114.817890052256
i will assist your memory madame continued the count the day had been burning hot you were waiting for horses which were delayed in consequence of the festival				27163.852338109897
to the palais royal he called out				332.1161548480548
he was superintending the grooming of his horse and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden when the count s carriage stopped at the gate				2109.5433472389395
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form				4053.3757684958896
villefort left her to the care of the women while old barrois ran half scared to his master for nothing frightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over them for a moment in order to strike some other old person				1150.6133230652786
mon dieu				14599.036099169009
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis				185.31239774876138
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat				3265.354399792901
his wings were broken and he seemed to sink into a bottomless abyss whence he awoke bathed in perspiration and nearly as much overcome as if he had really fallen				2787.119915659282
still further de wardes whom he had treated so ill was one of the tools of his eminence and d artagnan knew that while his eminence was terrible to his enemies he was strongly attached to his friends				321.27972602645417
athos however perpetually recurred to his proposed interview with the queen				293.490055907487
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass				5350.007128409986
on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use				28020.64690947952
it is my fault madame said raoul				314.61073027447986
be brave faithful and loyal he said you are brave faithful and loyal				1850293.4338399651
replied the count				114.36380639070457
shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate				1600964.1509018557
the bracieux estate was a few leagues from villars cotterets				148289.45010457298
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				17971.340698574342
it appears to me that this cavalier has made you very angry				8617.958874715963
the people were infuriated they stopped the horses and cut the escort to pieces whilst i opened the doors of the carriage and monsieur de rochefort jumped out and soon was lost amongst the crowd				7713.979271205783
• you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg™ works				1855.629075950104
i do not know do you wish for anything i wish to see the governor the jailer shrugged his shoulders and left the chamber				412.3252332237146
in the avenue des champs élysées that the count of monte cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps				2087.7928291082912
it was time for they had scarcely sailed half a league when d artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation				1900867.4495327265
d artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had embraced him on his departure but he feared lest this mark of affection bestowed upon his lackey in the open street might appear extraordinary to passers by and he restrained himself				196.91667058115826
it is perhaps needless to add that morrel departed almost at the same time				329.1055804541758
your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly				137293.45839970125
tomorrow you shall be free i had but one wish that was that he should kill me				71.77215789550162
i was so situated as to hear and see everything he answered				34519.01049300195
the fifth of september chapter				202.500118328811
caderousse meanwhile continued to pace the room in gloomy silence sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest but as soon as the stranger had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it				59.9625069312872
bonacieux and if she was returning to paris why this fugitive rendezvous why this simple exchange of a glance why this lost kiss				7916.22923860964
etiquette had no minutiæ unknown to him				26.46210427515766
monte cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured here beneath this plane tree must have been where the infant s grave was dug				1671806.4750659757
then her hair assumed successively under her skillful hands all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her face				320.0274802797781
monsieur athos do me then the honor to accompany me you and your two friends and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty if we should meet him the three musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses				977.014464759703
i have the note said he to athos and to his friends				313.52781751015294
my prisoner he cried				1763.813587284574
so then said he the letter was true to the end did you doubt it my dear monsieur bartolomeo no indeed certainly not a good man a man holding religious office as does the abbé busoni could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your excellency has not read all ah true said monte cristo there is a postscript yes yes repeated the major yes there is a postscript in order to save major cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his banker i send him a draft for francs to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further sum of francs which you still owe me the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety				2276.8884412140605
my father s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson m de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared				1139.0512893418445
d artagnan returned to help porthos if porthos needed help but porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as d artagnan				148.00806557523694
the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the nave				1649742.353760666
behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of delight				8252.775317084635
why diamonds and she is covered with them to me she seems overloaded observed eugénie she would look far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists see how the artist peeps out exclaimed madame danglars				428.3355824629509
their connection could not last long without ruining both				9477.847685175811
he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear before him was the vast expanse of waters sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm				17578.237733481947
have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas				5159.271187533895
albert followed him with the count				229.108569845409
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black				23422.600774879116
planchet stopped short staring at d artagnan				13.980444751520821
the water passed over his head and the sky turned gray				207050.27853013924
he had wept all night long but would not show his grief before the people				842.0656358852779
almost an impossibility replied the major				5607.155024916337
oh heavens exclaimed monte cristo can my suspicions be correct				2088741.9920249726
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said				144.25979287817194
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms				590.8897589992712
the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged				5217.737832350179
and how many men had he with him i do not know sire answered the minister of police				5712.246951074538
signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal when franz had finished reading this account so dreadful for a son when valentine pale with emotion had wiped away a tear when villefort trembling and crouched in a corner had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man sir said d épinay to noirtier since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some interest in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not one final satisfaction tell me the name of the president of the club that i may at least know who killed my father villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the door valentine who understood sooner than anyone her grandfather s answer and who had often seen two scars upon his right arm drew back a few steps				2041.1083441139908
on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow				17818.21031908721
the next morning king charles i was haled by a strong guard before the high court which was to judge him				30.689977288938483
have you not hit upon any asked danglars				186.68880257856154
you positively recognize m de morcerf as the officer fernand mondego indeed i do cried haydée				3757.120502551703
the woman especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals				1922269.406968972
they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning				19561.28431929117
the duke walked so fast that d artagnan had some trouble in keeping up with him				31.50306007272886
the hostess replied only by gasps				5172778.237390758
then the officer with the same calm politeness invited his prisoner to enter the house				401.5870294340103
i did not even touch your hand and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant yes but calumny seized upon all those follies in which i took no part as you well know my lord				835.7421410325153
mademoiselle eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel				740175.5860306676
it was like the eve of a battle the heart beat the eyes laughed and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose was after all a good thing				2013.5412765836666
excuse my weakness				3007.101214474209
the cause was not in dantès but in providence who while limiting the power of man has filled him with boundless desires				135407.73449205232
does the cardinal refuse to receive the king				500.13405622014164
it is my wish that she should marry m franz d épinay and she shall marry him valentine sank weeping into a chair				307.87280812863713
yes he murmured yes be satisfied his head dropped upon his chest and in this position he paced his study then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to rest his limbs cramped with cold and study				859.0076570413202
d artagnan refused but thinking the opportunity a good one he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued as he wished to turn it into money				1007.201827638686
now let us talk the matter over quietly said the count				115.40177804885847
tomorrow perhaps he may change you				56.89092214893622
she will soon get over these things so saying madame de saint méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a son in law s respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor renée				3379368.1438779933
oh m d avrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m noirtier just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking and the same love for you eh my dear child yes said valentine he was very fond of me who does not love you valentine smiled sadly				16357.974254557075
when she was only about three steps from him he turned his head round fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion who had risen and was approaching followed by her black boy and her woman				1012.6618894374612
it was mousqueton who was obeying his master s command				7535.903173076076
ah i always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter and she greedily read the following few lines my dear child hold yourself ready				1714.488132710497
i shall come back to dessert keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars				63250.01086118586
i will give you said he but not a sou more besides as that is the exact value of the stone i brought just that sum with me oh that s no matter replied caderousse i will go back with you to fetch the other francs no returned the jeweller giving back the diamond and the ring to caderousse no it is worth no more and i am sorry i offered so much for the stone has a flaw in it which i had not seen				3176.7407556517933
alas poor albert				453.8725574678978
the pistols were loaded he stretched forth his hand took one up and murmured his daughter s name				505.38129634693803
the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man if those clothes had not been torn to shreds still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hands of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat				2313.82300912443
your excellencies permit it asked the host				984.5857299454925
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon				1229124.1972370753
we too said athos to the footman who had given him that answer not only bring news from england but have just come from there what				506.28169291851685
he cast a rapid glance around the room and perceived that one of his men was missing				57962.70387660269
the pistol fell from his hands				386.6845238109931
think of it sire				4582.842380798366
judge if i should not put myself under its protection flattery was at that period very current and m de tréville loved incense as well as a king or even a cardinal				409.1592179788381
pardon you monseigneur				3916.0044829888457
he s well guarded now we only said he would escape who said so repeat your story saint laurent replied the man turning to the originator of the tale				47452.59882356313
do you agree with aramis not at all said d artagnan i am precisely of the contrary opinion what				479.8814823685981
peppino pretended not to hear him and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly				6260.473312437269
you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed go up when you are ready and sleep well joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host good night and mounted the stairs				1299.0280434379388
morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant				7375.676581540816
as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him i don t call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice				187.6507315704863
there s luck my lord				643.6944268921711
listen replied felton in a low voice				192.5320222644165
he had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy				833.04180582506

athos and d artagnan watched their approach from the window				531.8129592836989
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction				17337.52835781485

everything had gone on as usual at the palais royal				4235.393737469026

nothing is concealed from the cardinal the cardinal knows everything in that case monseigneur do you believe the cardinal will be so kind as to tell me what has become of my wife perhaps he may but you must in the first place reveal to the cardinal all you know of your wife s relations with madame de chevreuse but monseigneur i know nothing about them i have never seen her when you went to fetch your wife from the louvre did you always return directly home scarcely ever she had business to transact with linen drapers to whose houses i conducted her and how many were there of these linen drapers two monseigneur and where did they live one in rue de vaugirard the other rue de la harpe did you go into these houses with her never monseigneur i waited at the door and what excuse did she give you for entering all alone she gave me none she told me to wait and i waited you are a very complacent husband my dear monsieur bonacieux said the cardinal				360.66823768828755

felton my lad did you not perceive that you were taken for a novice and that the first act was being performed of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following out all the developments i thought so my lord said felton but as the prisoner is a woman after all i wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle birth owes to a woman if not on her account at least on my own milady shuddered through her whole system				35932.96507610814
meanwhile m de villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at m d avrigny s door				188.1947446636551
what he asked athos				11.665949941950483
the first object that met the eyes of d artagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions				969436.795024722
all four came up together				833.1216519341531
as to that we know d artagnan s courage he exposed himself freely to danger and while charging at the head of his company he received a ball through the chest which laid him prostrate on the field of battle				1013.3255768285214
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspector s visit but a dream an illusion of the brain				1296.8507335920074
very true replied the gascon but i always run away from compliments				20459.69865271848
it followed that d artagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friends athos porthos and aramis				199.44640986280643
i tell you marquis my fortune is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the king will not forget the service i do him in that case go and get ready				1711.745058151116

i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of roman crowns about francs				633.0957059310998
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls				2216366.3274608254
oh the women the women cried the old soldier				5479.705349227909
my poor mother said villefort to have such duties to perform at your age after such a blow god has supported me through all and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done everything for me that i performed for him				29.62140827966157
in fact we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneasiness				2265.1130397532856
mazarin saw the sign and remained convinced that d artagnan had seen and heard everything but he was pleased with his falsehood				6925.662316787219
dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea				1033.4880423068919
m de monte cristo has only shown us kindness				17166.07721158703
go on said felton you see plainly that i listen and that i am anxious to know the end evening came the ordinary events took place				457.3821590385918
thinking of all this and from time to time giving a touch of the spur to his horse d artagnan completed his short journey and arrived at st germain				4747.6384413164615
go and look for the comte de la fere i wish to speak with him aramis found athos and brought him				27.679235900971584
don t question me i beg of you but lend me a horse my stables are at your command viscount but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback				4457.782359329137
when he approached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon it without a word of warning and the members of the group whether rebels or not as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to deal at once gave place to the patrol				6400.916075323841
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters				16711.352778290217
lead me to him jacopo pointed towards the horizon				2456.9696431176894
bertuccio left				1383.955281689409
i will not allow the prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs				1090.6932963966565
as to porthos that is certainly droll but i am not the less a giddy fool				12283.167490690133
but make haste i can not stay here all day other footsteps going and coming were now heard and a moment afterwards the noise of rustling canvas reached dantès ears the bed creaked and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it				57.440125120963096
rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner				1013.6894851969437
happily he did not meet anyone				7913.089267633655
at that moment he cut it				45.315966399962555
he waited then in the ante chamber with impatience till he should be conducted to them				78.34929476062852
he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street				1242.5468467055127
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead asked d artagnan				41.28251138816515
caderousse rose				3722.9155210051185
sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant and what do you think of her personal appearance oh i consider her perfectly lovely she is just my idea of what medora must have been franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company				2686.91677603029
this thought the house of morrel is about to stop payment bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done				907.8009555937332
ali smiling repeated the sound grasped the reins with a firm hand and spurred his horses whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze				1252457.2038944564
and rally to the old cry of france montjoy and st denis the war cry of england is too often in the mouths of traitors they mounted the king on winter s horse and winter on that of the king then winter took his place at the head of the first squadron and the king with athos on his right and aramis on his left at the head of the second				2123.928381530292
accordingly d artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him				29.555696006557753
by an incredible effort of will i even raised myself up but only to sink down again immediately and to fall into the arms of my persecutor tell me who this man was cried the young officer				2300.9292986143373
sire i thought his name was unknown to your majesty no no blacas he is a man of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and pardieu you know his father s name his father yes noirtier noirtier the girondin noirtier the senator he himself and your majesty has employed the son of such a man blacas my friend you have but limited comprehension				88098.21763540202
what do you say to this project the cardinal had listened without permitting a single fibre of his face to betray what he felt and his smile remained as it ever was false and flattering and when the queen finished speaking he said do you think madame that france agitated and disturbed as it is would be a safe retreat for a dethroned king				530.2334265483232
but in france they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such affairs judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge bertuccio clasped his hands and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the light showed his pale and altered countenance				729.8553717220578
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared				397.6149693045342
the count has a mind above vulgar desires and earthly passions				1665757.2874200859
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time but if you yourselves should be struck said athos				90.8220910704592
milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges				13092.258527988299
during the first act the countess g entered				738.9000197654509
ten minutes later they heard the rapid gallop of a troop of horsemen				2526.130706477591
these poor creatures had no bad intentions				8822.10912833386
now my excellent signor pastrini said franz addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to visit the count of monte cristo most assuredly replied he				306.73365722532156
other turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers				2956.760204718687
he never gave advice but when it was asked and even then he required to be asked twice				7375.866501805645
nothing replied grimaud				288.2029207041039
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom				6764.197308665822
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood				3805.1332626752496
the old man who had preserved all his usual coolness made a sign to him to do so				325.12298604839197
it is excellent advice				13063.884236831509
but first of all i must get there he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo				291.7542689798658
then on the anniversary of the day on which i had been insulted i hung my cassock on a peg assumed the costume of a cavalier and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to which i knew my man was invited				37116.05148353696
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair				1014.1004285627797
albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered				967040.6137698188
he stood with his arms folded apparently as calm as any man could be in such circumstances				5766.538305227057
is it not so father the old man made a sign in the affirmative				1554.509125872696
ten minutes afterwards general morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves				5926.1496110577455
of course				1803.6129915782835

prince cavalcanti said the latter prince cavalcanti where are you andrea andrea repeated several young people who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian name				509.89959257956764
in brief how much remains twenty five pistoles said d artagnan				4.390819615141915
on each side of the choir and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole community of the carmelites who listened to the divine service and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests without seeing the profane or being seen by them				78.63310734507397
scarcely was the count alone when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him				30.809800637287104
meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs my little fellow				2266.9920953435167
stop said the englishman i have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper				2120.4412488724197
the cannonade of the isle of ré presaged to him the dragonnades of the cévennes the taking of la rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the edict of nantes				1572070.788195589
he then returned with the same slow step and said go and tell the dying man that he must be patient				7366.552106827473
i received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea and to conduct you to this castle				2177.224706687951

although la rochelle was invested however certain success might appear thanks to the precautions taken and above all to the dyke which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city the blockade might last a long time yet				4430.183859080742
did you drink some too m noirtier yes and did you also discover a bitter taste yes oh doctor cried barrois the fit is coming on again				252.8539675015595
i see it and i thank you for it				50.185418476852526
this is where the mad abbé was kept sir and that is where the young man entered and the guide pointed to the opening which had remained unclosed				2586967.589789027
yes yes replied mazarin				258.79617010620615
suppose her majesty refuses oh said d artagnan monseigneur knows very well that her majesty refuses him nothing here monseigneur said aramis is the treaty proposed by the deputation of frondeurs				2314612.2371538784
bowing under the weight of twenty four years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of château renaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son s life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young man s heart every feeling of filial piety				1650227.0065448545
and it was no bad one i believe since here we are i do not say replied andrea that you never make a good one but let us see your plan well pursued caderousse can you without expending one sou put me in the way of getting fifteen thousand francs				656.1660984087277
then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon				9361.452826430434
he turned and saw a young woman who made him a sign to follow her				147.89984196771306
morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air and the wind which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there				531.3364271313781
come to us this evening and to morrow we ll return your visit capital				1471.2190285034249
this was the name which he gave him in former days in their moments of tender intimacy				1015010.9957617054

people die very suddenly in your house m de villefort what cried the magistrate with an accent of horror and consternation are you still harping on that terrible idea still sir and i shall always do so replied d avrigny for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this time listen well to what i am going to say m de villefort the magistrate trembled convulsively				194835.08318129688
it is a duel then cried mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation				1300316.5909461018
we immediately drew and at the first pass i laid him stark dead the devil cried d artagnan				41.115880117752
i spent perhaps an hour in coming from the yard to this place then my strength gave out and i fainted again and now how are you feeling very ill replied the wounded man				80.71546364215502
the lackeys were brought by the cries she made				2995.863301743588
it was the island of monte cristo				261.56400141770735
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the hôtel de ville for this important evening				717.2518652091944
you must depart instantly monsieur				1120.8295501369596
the mendicant hesitated at first but at the sight of the piece of silver which shone in the darkness he consented and walked on before athos				142.61515305815823
not so bad yet replied athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of france d artagnan breathed again				253.2125560674646
these individuals are under arrest				198157.67908091313
the opinion of all the commercial men was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down morrel it was impossible for him to remain solvent				1766040.5844233194
you see said raoul we have done wisely what a horrible face that monk has said de guiche				3438.166175102841
leave me i command you carlini obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest				827.5437619266987
but no matter we must trust in god as soon as the plank was withdrawn the captain took his place at the tiller and made a sign to one of the sailors who boat hook in hand began to push out from the labyrinth of boats in which they were involved				2407667.620415262
a heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions				1925021.2031816961
his relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many things that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes consulted				1970855.9532139474
and what has happened to you my dear porthos continued d artagnan				28.304604434025276
the prince exclaimed at the same moment athos and aramis unmasking as they addressed the duc de beaufort whilst d artagnan and porthos stepped backward				170091.88766678103
he grew more pale every minute and they were obliged to support him on his horse				935.3942816621552
holloa said he what does that mean if monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me in the first place what crimes are imputed to me i will then tell him the deeds i have really done crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours monsieur said the cardinal				360.82167649333064
well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel				2269.154016699576
no but gaetano did i thought gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone and if this person be not a smuggler who is he a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree what is his name if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be his real name sinbad the sailor yes and where does he reside on the sea what country does he come from i do not know have you ever seen him sometimes what sort of a man is he your excellency will judge for yourself where will he receive me no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel				4496.705909425747
yes the marechal de grammont is right this will change the aspect of french affairs but i much fear it will do nothing for english even if it does not harm them				69.94283600150611
nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french speak italian sir				845.5641710775263
it must have been delirium she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even heard the noise it made on touching her glass it is singular said the doctor i was not aware that madame de saint méran was subject to such hallucinations it is the first time i ever saw her in this condition said valentine and this morning she frightened me so that i thought her mad and my father who you know is a strong minded man himself appeared deeply impressed we will go and see said the doctor what you tell me seems very strange the notary here descended and valentine was informed that her grandmother was alone				918.3323449964851
no my lord and i will set out at once				767.1223549609063
then he passed his hand across his forehead which was clouded with doubt				3153.7962095387516
till tomorrow evening then till tomorrow evening then replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital				6463.386045545838
they who love believe easily in love				923.5766041712994
ho replied aramis				18.39815740924896
but the voyage was not ended				7443.101261493254
oh as for that i ll take you to a splendid place said the man with the handkerchief and taking the horse s bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for anyone to witness the honor that andrea conferred upon him				30.79553138570447
call the viscount and take the musket with you blaisois was the tall youth half groom half peasant whom we saw at the chateau de bragelonne whom athos had christened by the name of his province				29387.490103196113
milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time				327.74843305115667
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his arms crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a table to support his clenched hand				161.01010896918947
did we not swear friendship				22960.84993721936
thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover s arm				1631.3441345600584
as perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the rue de jerusalem and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap				12629.84688745899
that might do if we were dealing with englishmen or germans oh may god keep me from it and you too said d artagnan				34.467147968317214
in fact the blow was direct and severe				155622.541925587
the carriage however passed on				864.5234420109213
d artagnan had with his sword cut in two the poor wretch who had laughed				3787.0502220590397
it is indeed thee yes yes constance				12042.924704027211
but do you happen to belong to him monsieur d artagnan replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority				7791.537557399949
at the sixth cabaret then as we said d artagnan stopped asked for a bottle of wine of the best quality and placing himself in the darkest corner of the room determined thus to wait till daylight but this time again his hopes were disappointed and although he listened with all his ears he heard nothing amid the oaths coarse jokes and abuse which passed between the laborers servants and carters who comprised the honorable society of which he formed a part which could put him upon the least track of her who had been stolen from him				29.269775854308595
why not sir asked charles				25056.48938347388
in fact he could say these two children of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which i alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the english people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say a throne				9182.767633794752
adieu then and be of good courage said athos				9.555758664744612
i neither approve nor disapprove my lord i merely await your commands good it is you accordingly that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to saint germain liar thought d artagnan				76.82358784370457
don t you think the executioner might be master cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself ah				273.874231281399
it is true that she had not perhaps been scrupulously faithful to him but she had remembered him that was something				4248.983118442977
now albert said he you understand me do you not				228.41992752888135
what a fool i was said he not to tear my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself chapter				248.08739188122144
she heard the count s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or pity then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified step which virgil attributes to his goddesses chapter				361.6177832684746
villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him				24.83442219098579
if i were obliged to fight against you i think i should allow myself to be pierced through and through for i never loved any one but you in the wide world and honest porthos burst into tears as he embraced athos				169.11516768546403
how did these letters come said he				19.363994427335054
how could i then return to brussels				18454.64685464924
raoul conquered the very natural feeling of timidity he experienced and approaching the prince my lord he said will you permit me to hazard a few words on that subject which will perhaps relieve you of your uncertainty the prince turned and seemed to cover the young man with a single glance he smiled on perceiving that he was a child hardly fifteen years old				1653.0802128328723
as the door opened the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter				1092.8767074092523
charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own father the king was not mistaken				2875.9258172207187
and i too he exclaimed in a low voice i unite with m morrel in demanding justice for crime my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession oh merciful heavens murmured villefort				237.27169010960503
although i was without mistrust a vague fear seized me and i tried to struggle against sleepiness				1772044.9342618375
diable he exclaimed when the door was shut they seem to have the greatest need of me just now then as the half hour had already glided by he crossed the gallery and knocked at the cardinal s door				181.47103567128391
sir he responded you are a stranger and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in oriental countries so you are not aware how human justice so expeditious in barbarous countries takes with us a prudent and well studied course oh yes yes i do sir it is the pede claudo of the ancients				3591881.7333092205
alas i would say you are welcome had not death opened the way for you into this house valentine said morrel with a trembling voice i had waited since half past eight and did not see you come i became uneasy leaped the wall found my way through the garden when voices conversing about the fatal event what voices asked valentine				898.2302900608175
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the english				4103.49913762616

i will do as children do for fear of losing the paper repeat the name along the route				3476.5517183450884
and we are going to be recompensed for our diligence continued the mercer with a trifling alteration in his voice so trifling indeed that d artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary shade which an instant before had darkened the countenance of the worthy man				133.1450267764858
i call those first rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one s hand such as mines lands and funded property in such states as france austria and england provided these treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions i call those second rate fortunes that are gained by manufacturing enterprises joint stock companies viceroyalties and principalities not drawing more than francs the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions finally i call those third rate fortunes which are composed of a fluctuating capital dependent upon the will of others or upon chances which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes such as banks speculations of the day in fact all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen millions				4101.237814728067
he was about at last to pass that mysterious threshold to climb those unknown stairs by which one by one the old crowns of m coquenard had ascended				134358.72403372964
i have already got up again after three stabs from you i shall never rise after this fourth count said d artagnan with some degree of emotion i struck without knowing that it was you				67.60588593384853

you think he is tracked pursued captured he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles				1595996.039447223
you may see matters differently d artagnan and think otherwise				7912.689312711656
but like the miser in the fable he could not sleep for thinking of his treasure				5471.840861695034

d artagnan on his part had gained the summit of all his wishes				5115.412464182322
he felt almost inclined to cross himself when one of these beings happened to approach him				31.30291677245413
meantime the three friends were standing motionless before the awful sight which d artagnan in raising the shutters had disclosed to them through the narrow opening of the window				532.8857034209937
la chesnaye said the king let someone go instantly and find monsieur de la trémouille i wish to speak with him this evening your majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between monsieur de la trémouille and myself nobody by the faith of a gentleman tomorrow then sire tomorrow monsieur at what o clock please your majesty at any hour you will but in coming too early i should be afraid of awakening your majesty awaken me				66.83708626188566
but she waited in vain				1226.865599850401
see answered the voice				159.58101547696265
we have already at the station three gentlemen whose passports are under examination who are on their way to her majesty				2109.777736975976
the dark space frightened her				91.81190855402751
there remained then no other place to fear but the traitor s cross the carriage was taking the direct road to it				57.351834241742026
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days to get married yes first and then to go to paris very good have what time you require dantès				432.29717400946527
the baron attracted by the noise in his chamber gown his sword under his arm stood in the doorway				39833.30797105947
brought up in paris where raoul had been but once at the court which raoul had never seen his follies as page two duels which he had already found the means of fighting in spite of the edicts against them and more especially in spite of his tutor s vigilance these things excited the greatest curiosity in raoul				1769.4449896785404
when at three paces distant from each other albert and the count stopped				2555.393674326009
i have happily only myself in the world to care for but what makes you sigh my dear fellow replied porthos to be candid with you i am not happy you are not happy porthos				134.39965634027115
i am ready said he				22.167327288970725
chapter xxviii				75407.09319988193
i ask much too much perhaps for i have no title to request it				51.009132747362884
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man				127.82586489237255
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs				15173.995349561323
our group would then be quite complete more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna well said franz this time m albert i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea and quite a national one too replied albert with gratified pride				3813.408786796976
now gentlemen a sortie cried athos				12.04325661917931
now guess what the young one did tell me he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own bed with its face to the wall then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body				1317.9473113739934
why did he kill himself instead of you				81.41441495877213
this son is named andrea cavalcanti				1464.5185682569024
the favorite of two kings immensely rich all powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice george villiers duke of buckingham had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive in the course of centuries to astonish posterity				850432.6993045665
her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels				3275.8063895151117
monsieur said albert with affectionate courtesy the count of château renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me you are his friend be ours also well said interrupted château renaud and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me what has he done asked albert				691.3806684006657
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure three curates remained those of st merri st sulpice and st eustache				6464.945716909685
do you hear how they sleep he asked				850.3121874454214
well i take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait together but i shall not be allowed to go i am almost a prisoner as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me well well				548.7688249680527
i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible yes said porthos				56.39261117549084
parry was not wrong				3030.137096716451
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped				2562.485457486198
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brother in law monsieur de tréville is particularly attached to their majesties				2415157.7449201955
speak out there s a worthy fellow your excellencies are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the count of monte cristo is living on the same floor with yourselves i should think we did know it exclaimed albert since it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms like two poor students in the back streets of paris when then the count of monte cristo hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two places at his windows in the palazzo rospoli the friends looked at each other with unutterable surprise				1598.0862818713306
the people were shouting and running about with torches				32545.370042388215
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark				3810.9402328707665
d artagnan finding a lantern on the deck took it up and with a pistol in his hand he said to the captain in english come being with the classic english oath the only english words he knew and so saying he descended to the lower deck				1522.5359768115154
in the old greek legend the atreidae or children of atreus were doomed to punishment because of the abominable crime of their father				1060.6251416387984
i make no account of the harm mordaunt can do cried d artagnan				8.611847538456079
oh sir				525.1106133503769
of what companion are you speaking dear constance of her whose carriage was at the gate of a woman who calls herself your friend of a woman to whom you have told everything her name her name cried d artagnan				105.27592280648673
ah there he is calling me now				1437.2307923186565
the poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past				2092.718575501671
dantès from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors				7687.6654706724285
i have been the cause of all your misfortunes but why do you pity instead of blaming me				71.80091150436819
the love i have for you is very different from the love i had for my father				1020.8982812862191
well my lord what i foresaw has come to pass what				450.7974749327131
although d artagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words				641.3390120213492
at length athos after serious reflection and becoming more pale than usual made a sign of assent to d artagnan who by it understood he was at liberty to speak				1596.3315359320914
you have water woods flowers there she sighed again and leaned her charming head gracefully reclined on her hand still beautiful in form and color				2906.200234585199
it is not either that my heart is less touched by him than any other that would be a schoolgirl s reason which i consider quite beneath me				67.16253990273485
we will accompany them only to a little village in limousin lying between tulle and angouleme a little village called roche l abeille madame de chevreuse uttered a cry of surprise and looked at athos with an expression of astonishment that made the old musketeer smile				404.26743461396387
in that case gentlemen said the footman on hearing the names which the queen had so often pronounced with hope in that case it is another thing and i think her majesty will pardon me for not keeping you here a moment				370.88591491945016
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his hand				156.6864856941644
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port				5018.849682065627
what is the use of boring one s self with so many things				1550.6668066548689
i would not go at all said aramis				17.56359049242955
the demon had known how to wound him				27.422312897700554
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majesty s voice and await the order of their captain have they not heard that of their colonel				3397098.0868497347
you understand that is to say i guess your wishes and that is all that s necessary said madeleine				10586446.064787727
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival				11183.03404560471
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold				4511.211157324643
as usual valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers but without gathering them				83.18846718770644
but i make war in my own way the two friends were crouching down meantime behind a tub in the side alley				1117111.7675095373
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation				731.6020936538575
julie said he to her cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs that completes the francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains				1544582.4421193174
the day before franz had been presented to madame de saint méran who had left her bed to receive him but had been obliged to return to it immediately after				6977.046003578414
this time there was no longer any doubt it was at the traitor s cross that lesser criminals were executed				6394.027928739779
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself				796.0596725578696
mazarin arose walked some moments thoughtful but not dejected				59164.84947990702
stop cried the soldiers and ran for their arms				606.8266584302788
in addition to this after a half hour s conversation d artagnan was convinced that milady was his compatriot she spoke french with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head				427.97115789113803
bonacieux you have perhaps some jewels you would like to take i have his letters said she				551.8181720743082
the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the doors of banking houses churches museums or theatres				530380.394911175
then taking a passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months longer chapter				341.6578687593053
woman is sacred the woman one loves is holy on yourself then unhappy man on yourself i am the only guilty person am i not said maximilian				1329.4424148982475
yes a base coward murmured d artagnan but she she was very beautiful what she demanded the host				899.0418748312425
a moment later madame de villefort entered the drawing room with her little edward				4269.47545309105
at this instant the three friends turned in spite of themselves a last look on the rock upon the menacing figure which pursued them and now stood out with a distinctness still				8713.56777568235
bravo said the captain				1368.9696817128895
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit				113587.13677740732
gentlemen said groslow i beg you will take your places				749340.6225128315
his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one				1144.0651729151045
the of february in what year in what year you ask me in what year yes replied the young man i ask you in what year you have forgotten then i got such a fright last night replied dantès smiling that i have almost lost my memory				1611.2577970480409
what is to be said				304.29178511974027
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity				277120.17485810514
you see my strength fails me you see plainly i can not walk				6747.272158878891
from whom is this said he eagerly				3637.6489714448253
had she betrayed him				25.17045920027017
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos				191.46526009749513
i embrace you with all my heart				277.32067897049006
know then what manner of woman it was for whom to day you call me to account				1871.8655950306206
i faint				19655.176164926663
you promised to bring a knife and to leave it with me after our interview say no more of that madame said felton				1340.9962143905793
debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her debray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he				438.98490470908706
are you a man for the substantials and is gold your god				443.90904085125214
he knew that athos not only never drank but more that he had a kind of repugnance to wine				1878.1706293188126
i own to you that that young man s visit has subdued my appetite and probably will rob me of my sleep				881.0274903638206
her friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution				166105.45102496503
at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me i have great power more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs élysées				2913.5180584962327
give me therefore one more day before i invite you i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality if you ask me for a day count i know what to anticipate it will not be a house i shall see but a palace				2023.5369688142118
i don t remember him groslow is the man who broke parry s head and is now getting ready to break ours oh				928.9190221205947
within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you				76.2582433230444
you have one at heart aramis one deeper and more painful a wound made by a woman the eye of aramis kindled in spite of himself				195.44612522494282
valentine had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his thoughts and to convey her own in return and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of every day life she failed to anticipate the wishes of the living thinking mind or the wants of the almost inanimate body				1280.489653580004
such a thing is really out of rule eccentric or stupid				1544147.9598011274
it was against his will that athos took these precautions but aramis had very judiciously reminded him that they had no right to be imprudent that they had been charged by king charles with a supreme and sacred mission which received at the foot of the scaffold could be accomplished only at the feet of queen henrietta				8016.306166090071
du vallon next me				46.16113913863431
a man with gray hair had thrown himself from the boat into the river and was swimming vigorously toward the person who was drowning but being obliged to go against the current he advanced but slowly				6180.382942301249
then he stepped into his coupé calm and smiling and was at home in five minutes				2545.3352536015345
but grimaud had for twelve or fifteen years preserved habitual silence and a habit of fifteen or twenty years duration becomes second nature				3576.665163581221
because said the old man the natural repugnance to the commission of such a crime prevented you from thinking of it and so it ever is because in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict line of duty				3926.2019722265813
how can i go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion you must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it or i swear you shall die by my hand pardon monsieur pity				1824.8003181844472
a secret may by chance be betrayed by gentlemen but it is almost always sold by lackeys porthos s plan appears to me to be impracticable said d artagnan inasmuch as i am myself ignorant of what instructions i can give you				70.51144061101694
the whole establishment had been changed another valet was engaged for himself a new servant for noirtier two women had entered madame de villefort s service in fact everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new faces were presented to the different masters of the house thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same family				1144.49677073824
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment				386.50902860386014
i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here duke said franz and desired them to come and inform me of his return ah replied the duke here i think is one of my servants who is seeking you the duke was not mistaken when he saw franz the servant came up to him				31.094487535671576
signor pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia				3338229.955574502
happily i vanquished death				464.66929109756387
the hour came for him to retire				3460.439379861392
no you are at your journey s end how monsieur				1208.8375732335473
all our servants are busy discussing the grand affair				1670.0343275217829
charles having proceeded with aramis as with athos embraced them both				9055.156979776853
come my friend come let me embrace you				45.49734144294532
for my part monsieur i am catholic my father faithful to his principles having made my elder brother a huguenot and what was the end of this worthy man asked d artagnan				60.81327555599656
a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five and twenty years of exile				1647051.032853025
various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the pharaon had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended				2080.434867974996
there is a man after my own heart				286.4708089425288
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you d artagnan placed his hand upon the queen s diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late				3430.9045535644677
the antechamber of m de tréville chapter iii				1532274.5048532132
to fall continued king louis who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended to fall and learn of that fall by telegraph				45898.42916532516
i will run to monsieur de tréville to tell them all this and will meet them there very well monsieur said planchet				586.1935786411207
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said				471.4633415843617
if grimaud was slow in speaking we know that he was quick to act he sprang to the door and shook it violently but it was bolted on the other side				1110.7758842603193
help sir said comminges declare yourself at once will you obey or do you intend to rebel against the king i obey i obey sir cried broussel trying to disengage himself from the grasp of his two daughters and by a look restrain his son who seemed determined to dispute authority				6473.539899788842
and she began to shriek more loudly clinging to the bars of the window help				4889.476991025052
what could she have done to you				53.83642224712961
and then continued mme				112.8078662964609
ah my poor friends murmured d artagnan where are you				81.87005108584239
and i also said franz				266.06476525232415
my husband has five or six valises you shall choose the best				6208.680132458214
has not some sage said nothing too much				3816.2173915827293
i am not without a good reason for my conduct replied the banker				6609.86829724587
have you a name then i bear that of your brother ay but you are mistaken				2795.5718699654217
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment				17034.081671191765
oh yes certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance				1535.6814863084455
then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against which he was leaning and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from time to time				335.5111639697433
you are in a shocking hurry to be off you forget one of my guests				2002.6245205540636
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace				1899.6938361572486
what should i care for either riches or poverty if my valentine was near me and i felt certain that no one could deprive me of her				146.21105427454367
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction				18598.94500515065
princes must be knocked on the head i remember it said athos				18.86302029516552
oh my god i have suffered enough surely				3277833.278550234
edmond had one friend only and thus it can not be divided				1966357.6813843788
yes continued the queen i think myself as much honored to have received you this evening as if you had been a prince and i wish to know your name yes thought planchet to treat me as a prince				723.7002510850645
the devil murmured d artagnan all this is vague enough				1377.3816291909077
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m de villefort				235.3920007020832
besides there was one thing that engaged his most anxious thought in what way was the escape to be effected				2599649.9904652606
they will think we are trying to leave england and will search for us at the ports meanwhile we shall reach london with the king				528.367256299173
d artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described				4907.584102746793
well this man				101.9810825234895
he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney				43161.76956731929
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us				245.85165295413358
here i am ready to give you any explanation you desire why said danglars in the letter i believe i have it about me here he felt in his breast pocket yes here it is				4104.289720924033
what is this said aramis to juxon				4796861.666793408
but as you are the strongest after all continued d artagnan don t be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked d artagnan with an eloquent look				694.8376934530452
milady faltered d artagnan and fainted a second time				292.2937151542795
well you have this excuse advancement the opening campaign the opportunity which i offer you so much for the world				1161.1986403143103
on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of the flight of eugénie and the arrest of benedetto villefort having retired as well as noirtier and d avrigny her thoughts wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had just heard				548.1584190644018
i ventured to tell her that mazarin was the lover of anne of austria				1630.9326850255445
the penalty of death i greatly fear they have gone too far for him to pardon them and there is nothing left to them but one thing and that is to kill him				28.374833699532804
oh yes said she smiling but we won t tell him in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper				2529.594964982867
you know no one but monsieur de tréville he asked				865.5983991284393
at the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door				194.27380164371604
the same expression continued				2327.253898790151
yes sir replied franz				257.93575264167345
at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the ice cold water and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves				3208.671325460953
let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three musketeers behind him if we see a close carriage at all suspicious in appearance come out let us fall upon it				56.42973171505374
that s a different thing yes i know there are traditions of that sort said comminges				6587.421337401605
say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him now then go said the marquis				384056.633337354
one day benedetto who had been gone from the house since morning to our great anxiety did not return until late in the evening dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree				18646.773042207333
as the day advanced the tumult became greater				57104.74207506805
i was sure of it the cursed letter don t be afraid you idiot there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed d artagnan i will go without you				75.71279830118802
strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man and at times gave it the appearance of life				479.1552831743543
her mistress was mad with love intoxicated with joy				890.2624474363048
danglars astonished opened the door but a strong hand pushed him back and the carriage rolled on				920.9055110564063
they had not seen him for two days				1726.702026308636
chapter xxxix				54998.856480206414
the two gentlemen were exasperated they had had a long ride and were dying with hunger and thirst				89367.44470360324
the two guards led in athos				164.8312617576175
five minutes after the door had been closed on morrel s entrance it was again opened for the count				254.90153726627437
our dear count said d artagnan				4.760020387001434
sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away				519.1894218277163
consider yourself as in your own house and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the apartments of m de morcerf he whom i wrote from rome an account of the services you rendered me and to whom i announced your promised visit and i may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person				1109.8170854659866
follow me then said the abbé as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès				551.948698704079
toward the end of the service the queen seeing comminges standing near her waiting for a confirmation of the order she had given him before quitting the louvre said in a whisper go comminges and may god aid you comminges immediately left the church and entered the rue saint christophe				1912322.5202881913
i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your heart or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and order events in our favor				1079.5954011891752
sire said aramis will not your majesty acquaint some of your friends of this friends answered charles sadly i have but three one of twenty years who has never forgotten me and two of a week s standing whom i shall never forget				62611.39253500611
now i remember quite well that on the table round which they were sitting were pens ink and paper				982.1881664996266
no one can say that m noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed				812.6272847755956
do you know her milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid				1521295.8911999932
the captain seemed inclined to go upon deck again but controlling himself he answered port wine ah				227.69991130105737
consider said aramis if you admit divine justice and its participation in the things of this world that woman was punished by the will of heaven				547.3967579207682
you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse				457.9731466788434
ah my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers well no madame this is the terrible news i have to tell you said villefort in a hollow voice no nothing was found beneath the flowers there was no child disinterred no				467.3540451838341
at eight o clock in the morning morrel entered their chamber				405.4436885056098
it was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers by but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty these passers by repressed their hilarity or if hilarity prevailed over prudence they endeavored to laugh only on one side like the masks of the ancients				2331075.8072754443
you can see it in his eye				1970.6123768757825
what shall we do yes why the same we had intended doing three days since set off what although you are not now going to be married you intend still listen louise				11012.89153300347
perhaps you would prefer being alone no replied he i will not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the opera balls				16706.01467308802
patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn				17313.85080911165
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this moment a friend a father who lives for my happiness and that of maximilian watches over me alas alas what a fearful extremity valentine would you rather denounce your stepmother i would rather die a hundred times oh yes die no you will not die but will you promise me whatever happens that you will not complain but hope i will think of maximilian you are my own darling child valentine				820.1083097739191
but immediately through this opening twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured				1329940.9029088714
you will describe it to me replied franz and the recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it				57.660925023274004
forward cried d artagnan driven to extremities biting his moustache and then he charged with his twenty men and dispersed them in fear				966.4357196495845
nothing was heard but cries of live the musketeers				2576.379200818377
i pardon you said he the ill you have done me				41.23528449488572
just reflect a little what an agitation the queen s mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years it is true said porthos				86.64304613108771
madame the passage is quite clear and your majesty can continue your road in fact the procession arrived in safety at notre dame at the front gate of which all the clergy with the coadjutor at their head awaited the king the queen and the minister for whose happy return they chanted a te deum				67466.64322840853
thus in all their dreams their wishes and their conversations vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel general of an army or governor of a province				26868.0283562493
i and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous prospects that law once held out to the eternally deluded parisians in the fantastic mississippi scheme				320227.6334465928
would not m noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte cristo				342.63610588206075
it is not known whether it was the devil who gave way or the monks who grew tired but within three months the penitent reappeared in the world with the reputation of being the most terrible possessed that ever existed				28820.7061940536
franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce				115986.06330041421
it is not to be called amiability it is her duty a slave does not dictate to a master come you are joking yourself now				1652.3599092440631
milady had him one day turned out of doors with sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions				1996776.7074998906
who are you then cried all the witnesses of this scene				1545.742739571628
sit down there and eat in security				43137.90205163
now i thank you for the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you from the bottom of my heart the count bowed again but lower than before he was even paler than mercédès				3150.0178027925626
the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment				1231.1548056609495
mistrust athos therefore who will not prosecute the affairs of any one even his own				725.0393914989701
an instant after dantès entered				770.9717038940165
and then i also wish to see a notary that i may be assured that all our property returns to valentine ah grandmamma murmured valentine pressing her lips on the burning brow do you wish to kill me				56.125902570542216
he was one of those fine ingenuous natures which assimilate themselves easily to the dispositions of others				1142.659653463002
but are you well assured sir lying behind the tent of lord leven i raised it and saw all heard all and when is this to be consummated to day this morning so your majesty must perceive there is no time to lose to do what				557.2982569291198
he is not dead then no monsieur he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body for you without question inflicted four upon the dear gentleman and he is still very weak having lost almost all his blood				1466.7556514429516
faria had dug his way through fifty feet dantès would dig a hundred faria at the age of fifty had devoted three years to the task he who was but half as old would sacrifice six faria a priest and savant had not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a distance of three miles to one of the islands daume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy sailor an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusement s sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project				41931.36070160806
the young louis was already dressed with the exception of his shoes and doublet he had allowed himself to be dressed in great astonishment overwhelming laporte with questions who replied only in these words sire it is by the queen s commands the bedclothes were thrown back exposing the king s bed linen which was so worn that here and there holes could be seen				3151.52922308696
the countess de winter chapter xxii				64789.47393497529
besides i am a picard then it is understood said d artagnan you would rather be killed than desert your post yes monsieur and there is nothing i would not do to prove to monsieur that i am attached to him good said d artagnan to himself				175.59839466925007
what are you doing asked he				18.573844106196187
oh yes scoundrel				82966.87166466462
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts				1888.0290018430617
peste returned albert i compliment you on it i have its fellow he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket and it cost me francs let us hear the history said franz motioning signor pastrini to seat himself				148.16595709954328
he was drawing in this circle geometrical lines and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the soldier of marcellus slew him				30.12262459072014
i reply my lord tis but little as certainly i shall not go alone i suppose not				311.53771452515207
hang it said porthos				12.495760576556647
my son he exclaimed suddenly where is my son edward edward and he rushed out of the room still crying edward edward the name was pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up				1091.3175746973877
at the end of the piece étienne entered and announced to eugénie that the horses were to the carriage and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits				100796.48516820784
they had only halberds before now they have muskets				3375.256397765568
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz				583.8411288918492
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort s for the purpose of returning the procureur s visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion				20379.000948936267
but what the devil are you about aramis continued athos				61.167265868133086
not a thought was given to a life which you once mercédès had the power to render blissful not one hour of peaceful calm was mine but i felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel				40816.05654750807
i will be silent then said milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner				1033.6319515316943
fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome fate				2433.563658258094
repeat it cried d artagnan it will make a little change not so for it is religious replied aramis it is theology in verse the devil said d artagnan				66.6915334818128
to what country demanded porthos				23.599922749990107
i am in your opinion a lara a manfred a lord ruthven then just as i am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me				68.90646043198979
come hither and let us talk the host approached with hesitation				12197.613884526667
i have heard here and there that this sister in law was a hussy				1967483.1622468906
these are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor				103483.43435545711
returning to her own room kitty had thrown the purse into a corner where it lay open disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet				59740.44779074843
no sir				709.9283782216321
yes sir replied mousqueton				646.0942288746578
you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said porthos				86.05548772580336
what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god a mournful sob burst from villefort s heart he approached the doctor and seizing his arm valentine said he it is valentine s turn your daughter cried d avrigny with grief and surprise				1601.865825597455
at the noise i raised myself up on one hand				156.4727256322376
go on it was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the door that opened onto the road i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the garden hedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig trees and fearing that caderousse might have some guest i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the night and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our presence				2465.6463776969476
i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent				168403.26096365342
read said morrel				195.20173191358546
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five o clock our little cabin boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom house officers advancing in our direction				16450.886596486118
but i do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten years what he did during these ten years god only knows				3834.545753336616
she was walking with her nurse marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback i stopped				2613.9344375391147
yes my dear aramis we all know that your views have a religious tendency i am only temporarily a musketeer said aramis humbly				230219.48290413336
we fetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern and sat down by selim				7912.613851785771
why it is indeed a true royal jewel which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier				2742621.4200761192
morrel relaxed his hold of valentine and retreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain				8867.252856500147
on my honor in one single throw but having lost the horses i am particularly anxious to preserve the harnesses stake your diamond then this				1011.25673375876
to regret the world is to regret the devil that is my conclusion and that is mine also said the curate				10375.058232826921
he seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie				6482.763722401581
i said my good fellow that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included				22243.470235757293
milady uttered a stifled groan				2791.5370289255893
do you understand it now athos uttered a cry of joy and admiration ran to a closet and drew forth workmen s clothes which the four friends immediately put on they then left the hotel athos carrying a saw porthos a vise aramis an axe and d artagnan a hammer and some nails				6681.0324753976265
on the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall oh god he read preserve my memory oh yes he cried that was my only prayer at last i no longer begged for liberty but memory i dreaded to become mad and forgetful				2007423.2253543634
carefully closing the box door ali placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian				1884699.2771747448
yes gentlemen the king in person the king who has come to ask for some account of what has happened what is the matter sire exclaimed lord leven				297717.6727169646
the recompense will exceed your expectations that is all i promise you more intrigues				9381.651361905135
signor pastrini remained silent a short time it was evident that he was musing over this answer which did not seem very clear				7185.078297876965
you heard cavalcanti that tells me their name and nothing else ah				230.47021861781553
but besides these eight men you doubtless place some guard outside oh no				365.28684665203554
after the ladies had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of madame de villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them the procureur had shut himself up in his study according to his custom with a heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires				131497.88214189696
you particularly wish it asked he				18.69100536843275
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing				26540.62573775642
mademoiselle said eugénie let the porter get the post chaise from the coach house and fetch some post horses from the hotel				2364.3965787110124
all the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man particularly when that young man is a musketeer had disappeared as if by enchantment and for fear no doubt that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world bazin had laid his hands upon sword pistols plumed hat and embroideries and laces of all kinds and sorts				121348.15305906074
observe said villefort smiling i do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels and that the thermidor and the of april in the year were lucky days for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites				2122207.577189262
should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart				327.1939430042486
come come cried rochefort				973.2035900989466
i only ask a brokerage of course that is perfectly just cried m de boville				77718.97546891193
this concerns your head i warn you who are you then demanded d artagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering it				52.499179887971316
between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss				18386.188026541913
a week passed by				13591.909892443817
but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have the good fortune to be beloved by you				78.88201857935984
milady seized the occasion				4121.155147640327
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech				21942.60155600785
yes continued the duke really i feel bored today beyond the power of description then let us have a match in the tennis court exclaimed la ramee				529.5572715716294
i have always said to you i love you as a brother but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my heart is another s is not this true fernand yes that is very true mercédès replied the young man yes you have been cruelly frank with me but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred law to intermarry you mistake fernand it is not a law but merely a custom and i pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor				1245.2070191287985
but wait a moment do not let us get angry or at least not yet				4515.472372549268
the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it immediately				1649.111416106087
this probability afforded him his first consolation				59885.962671202666
no no she answered i would rather remain here are you really frightened madame said monte cristo				133.3403335188862
holloa there some bread he called				2847.2712100911467
they will return said d artagnan				4.782619906368429
yes there is something in what you say nevertheless do not believe that it is madame de longueville with whom i am in love a plague on t				22001.18899534568
now then go go in the name of heaven				535.1678177096842
the rendezvous d artagnan ran home immediately and although it was three o clock in the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of paris to traverse he met with no misadventure				2563826.4655108727
tomorrow if you will i will hear your narrative but today i wish to nurse you carefully				16774.119443338288
the two doctors therefore entered the room alone				875.5045078492495
but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose				1830.7390444434918
at length i discovered that he went mysteriously to auteuil				15148.273178363455
my first impressions were favorable to the minister i said to myself that a minister is never loved but that with the genius this one was said to have he would eventually triumph over his enemies and would make himself feared which in my opinion is much more to be desired than to be loved d artagnan made a sign with his head which indicated that he entirely approved that doubtful maxim				1641315.2389653344
time which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these signs which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite purpose				1832.3416351517951
nevertheless while acknowledging the truth of what he said i thought proper to insist but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself				191.79220227138595
however he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine again the next night				517.923909505448
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling yes				930.4825969030888
the carmelite convent at béthune chapter lxii				22198.247670450477
well my dear parry said he what is the matter and what can affect you in this manner oh my king said parry with tears in his eyes and in a tone of supplication do not look to the left as we leave the hall and why parry do not look i implore you my king but what is the matter				956.1091916328245
ah ah				217.4171411441119
i give you a hundred i give you a thousand times to guess monsieur the visit i received in your absence when about half an hour ago while you were at monsieur de tréville s who has been here				657.6276422226605
the sound of heavy steps was heard above his head				441.21819568985006
we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe				56207.6746473974

de villefort he said will you conduct the baroness danglars villefort complied and they passed on to the dining room				90.87173485386828
the duke vouchsafed no reply but sitting down at the table made a sign that la ramee should seat himself opposite				4257320.882176245
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts				1651707.022194247
the young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the pont neuf opposite the samaritaine a singular introduction you will find that it is as good as another patrick galloped off reached the duke and announced to him in the terms directed that a messenger awaited him				29.552997271617485
i suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron s banking establishment i was not aware of it replied albert but i can readily believe it and further that he stated to m danglars his intention of only staying a year in paris during which time he proposed to spend six millions				4205.681176026636
dantès made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist				863753.3973222229
well this is just what amuses me said monte cristo				75.23996397524229
my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart and he gave him his hand				155.74768963618666
he commanded a retreat which began step by step foot by foot unhappily in an instant he fell mortally wounded				3352.6904603716034
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the wall sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered him				31.902241912096585
now madame said debray delivering up his accounts in the methodical manner of a stockbroker there are still francs the interest of this money in my hands but said the baroness i thought you never put the money out to interest excuse me madame said debray coldly i had your permission to do so and i have made use of it				61.3528144013101
who will support them a shudder ran through the young man s frame				9646.990527553673
indeed he does and in a most lavish manner i can assure you i must try and persuade m danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner or something of the sort that he may be compelled to ask us in return what said debray laughing do you really mean you would go to his house why not				375.64110016894966
having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track				47415.95697481992

yours cried she throwing back her veil yours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten				5016.055233061002
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption				162291.82374525283
well m de villefort how would you advise me to act asked he				69.9500069078589
the king s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of athos s heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom				3907.327447367071
the duke was obliged to make as many efforts to awake as he had done to go to sleep and la ramee found him so pale and fatigued that he inquired whether he was ill in fact said one of the guards who had remained in the chamber and had been kept awake by a toothache brought on by the dampness of the atmosphere my lord has had a very restless night and two or three times while dreaming he called for help what is the matter with your highness asked la ramee				531.5492929591625
luigi vampa what think you of that inquired franz				276.05437007873627

villefort continued he knows me and i have pledged my word to him				28.497716228234598
what is it asked the baroness				1723.7602152272204
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility				654790.6009271849
he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen				437.8898320859388
these three others fenced against him with their agile swords				4778.649899123722
a horse for planchet that s all				343.2296947670692
then he had a moment s hesitation				11114.381911717468
you owe me nothing but some trifle of francs which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the turn events might take upon my word said albert i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take everything as i found it and to let those bandits see that although men get into troublesome scrapes all over the world there is no nation but the french that can smile even in the face of grim death himself				165.34483137355454
morrel took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself				185.452065217733
this idea was one of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity				4141.453568770371
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head				482.7369892401623

the most urgent thing now is to learn where the enemy is and what he is doing it fell naturally to the count de guiche to make reply not only was he the elder but he had been presented to the prince by his father				1015.296011434951
morrel could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but valentine suffering weeping wringing her hands before him was more than he could bear in silence				506.3316680670883
i reasoned thus money time and fatigue are nothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family probabilities will not suffice only facts will justify a deadly combat with a friend				343.9443430310558
as a friend and only as a friend at this moment				375.265316144648

grimaud s agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news				11514.64089771425
he touched him on the shoulder				1406.7029152661958

the rest concerns myself don t be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis				92.86209395435623
and d artagnan had time therefore to watch bazin unsuspected				1959889.3037651177
the damps of the dew bathed the head of villefort and refreshed his memory				1469.5671474042629
it is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed in fact as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit				33218.142901410065
yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four hundred but four hundred what listen cried d artagnan				86.73870093388763

so he cherishes no resentment you are mistaken porthos said d artagnan				4.902692883361741

his reserve his roughness and his silence made almost an old man of him				32.53992026331036

the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library				42104.348469814904
are you too proud to accept it young gentleman no sir said d artagnan and i will guard it so carefully that i will be sworn it shall arrive at its address and woe be to him who shall attempt to take it from me m de tréville smiled at this flourish and leaving his young man compatriot in the embrasure of the window where they had talked together he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised letter of recommendation				62330.72555033866
the matter had been named to him by d artagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the danger				4783.551482597413
i will call thee mouston and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any longer oh cried mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor i shall be grateful all my life it is too much to ask alas thought d artagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me will monsieur remain long with us asked mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance				729.2945755567819
athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the musketeer that he might come in				572.9648414344664
she seemed however by certain signs to recognize a door and approaching that door and now monsieur said she it is here i have business a thousand thanks for your honorable company which has saved me from all the dangers to which alone i was exposed				65619.93069554698
i was as i told him resolved to die of hunger				34328.1111274763
i know you are not rich madame coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them				80.125375815174
he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find him				27.53510879908791
mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle				3858.216540390618
yes i know it because yesterday monsieur de wardes in a saloon where i was showed a ring which he said he had received from you wretch cried milady				591.4693379016404
there d artagnan was asleep upon a bench				102937.1546416403
had not government better profit by it				54.293295055230296
but then your word is given yes doubtless i have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves her but not to one who does not				371.92478208493986
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our faults				3655107.8629741045
the carriage of monsieur le coadjuteur				3070664.7668880285
did you not say she was dead three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her but she murdered the woman i loved				4847.800816909715
the two friends met her in the corridor greatly troubled and much upset by such strange events she called some of the nuns who against all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men				877.2763842919546
your feet too said grimaud				296.5716600008457
go on while i endeavor to recall circumstances and now i am convinced said d artagnan that this abduction of the queen s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking and perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris the gascon is full of ideas said porthos with admiration				2991.1214520366334
it was fourteen years day for day since dantès arrest				193410.69923222082
but if they say it must be to me am i no longer king the queen remained silent				2610.3857948911123
i am hardly nineteen i know nothing i have no part to play				19516.730804011775
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie				9114.65273276188
now you have done grimaud take our brigadier s half pike tie a napkin to it and plant it on top of our bastion that these rebels of rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king grimaud obeyed without replying				935200.3681169344
do you talk of your honor				669.6935380675975
when daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream he was thirsty and dragged himself towards it				59.21813203612228
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king				534.2338802974432
my dear athos cried aramis i think you consented to accompany me only to give me a lesson god forgive me wait a little aramis it will be time for you to perceive my motive when we have paid our visit to the coadjutor let us then go to the archiepiscopal palace said aramis				143.26300004151645
the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion				3603.2325042498146
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination				1616.3057859014987
my sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses my brother is reading his two papers la presse and les débats within six steps of her for wherever you see madame herbault you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find m emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school at the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to five and twenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose tree raised her head				477.4679730722204
then the tunnel will be discovered the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry i uttered will be questioned				25292.56124993919
morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed nothing				977.4706646219246
no no but wounded without doubt killed perhaps				9301.082287434696
eh he said negligently this money is not mine				1212.451344999635
but besides all this in order that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore one of my colleagues will help me and contrary to custom will assist in the dictation of the testament				1386064.809208262
the travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet with less interruption but at crèvecœur aramis declared he could proceed no farther				33086.271036194994
the english repulsed foot by foot beaten in all encounters and defeated in the passage of the isle of loie were obliged to re embark leaving on the field of battle two thousand men among whom were five colonels three lieutenant colonels two hundred and fifty captains twenty gentlemen of rank four pieces of cannon and sixty flags which were taken to paris by claude de st simon and suspended with great pomp in the arches of notre dame				2936.6967218733266
there goes one cried athos at the end of five hundred paces				10969.433262041242
the duke was in the act of combing his beard which he had allowed to grow as well as his hair in order to reproach mazarin with his wretched appearance and condition				3872.139003483594
but he was soon aroused from these reflections by lubin who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might				6450.540795175093
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat				1222.2083812683707
the cause which the young man espoused was one so sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes he yielded and contented himself with following morcerf				1019.2124182502859
at this instant the door opened				2702.5983903039923
i have concentrated here at naseby camp all the resources heaven has left me and i write to you in haste from thence				2112839.466917136
i was like you and had a king in keeping aha said groslow what king our own to be sure the little one louis xiv and how long had you to take care of him three nights and by my troth i shall always remember those three nights with a certain pleasure how do you mean i mean that my friends officers in the guards and mousquetaires came to keep me company and we passed the night in feasting drinking dicing ah true said the englishman with a sigh you frenchmen are born boon companions and don t you play too when you are on guard never said the englishman				1251.0573900640454
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse this was d artagnan s mount				120509.27068651958
planchet and bazin shall go				1203.5627795187618
meanwhile danglars stooping to monte cristo s ear your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the names fernand and yanina indeed said monte cristo				215.6842508304987
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety				1913698.109387347
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs				1532107.926752599
you are gathering your crop sir said monte cristo smiling				558.1689708692805
are you likely to be more humane to me than others were yesterday				4168.815534330221
i have been brought up by monsieur le comte with the intention i believe of making me a soldier and he gave me reason to hope that at paris he would present me to some one who would recommend me to the favor of the prince yes i understand it well				524.1689821912164
the will was made the day before yesterday i believe you see there has been no time lost oh mercy m d avrigny no mercy sir				812.2212957779018
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brows				135858.3886666793
morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed				3438925.651998574
accept that which the bearer brings you make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black eyes				373.3030144273949
he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors				1590486.5797306742
at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright				12315.106550220375
there is good and holy action to be performed monsieur and much money to be gained at the same time mme				187.29378248136163
if i once went up those stairs				1325.5867641487255
nevertheless i promise thee thou shalt be hidden here though i risk by concealing thee neither more nor less than my lieutenancy if it was found out that i gave one rebel an asylum ah				271.1389903463243
once under my grandfather s roof m morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case i shall expect m morrel to come and claim me at my own hands				392.7918991816185
should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected i would turn it at once into money i would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my father s chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the cemetery des innocents and i should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress attracted by my good looks rode along to marry me				68.39295309978337
in order doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the priest rose as soon as d avrigny departed and not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left but also that leading to madame de villefort s room				92.76428648431944
athos and d artagnan said nothing but their silence seemed to imply consent				161323.05840956394
now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast				6345.884862204017
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within				9416.062001187836
peppino picked up the louis and danglars again prepared to carve the fowl				8554.979901324126
he was not deceived it was she whom he sought				42159.79724238776
you do not believe me m danglars i can not help doubting answered danglars with his stupid smile				383.9870124673543
madame de villefort who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the misfortune but mademoiselle valentine at the first words guessed the whole truth notwithstanding all the precautions of her father the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless and how was m de saint méran related to mademoiselle de villefort said the count				236.58750286936314
this guide was our friend peppino who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road				1253.4446743956428
de montbazon and mme				157.72665369475516
both were evidently stimulated by the same impulse				2530841.524318121
the wind was chilly and the jetty was deserted as he approached it but he had no sooner landed than he heard a noise of horses galloping upon the paved road				1314.4132772246203
my god i am dying and the duke swooned				1778734.5366804567
oh i will find it he cried you may pretend he is not here but i will find him though i dig forever monte cristo drew back in horror				8818.46687002414
stay stay how strange that it should not have occurred to me before				1161.031987773661
hold hold hold said athos wit his quiet tone that throw of the dice is extraordinary				41355.631193398505
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				17971.32355977646
call mr felton said he				22.914396143615665
he believed having triumphed over me in my sleep that all was completed				125405.69375726685
that is never done				803.6487168278132
when he came within hearing he exclaimed i am pursued can you conceal me they knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit but there is an innate sympathy between the roman brigand and the roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former				1257658.9963204346
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain oh it is terrible and m de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father				1053.14034468739
grimaud wishing to relieve him advanced his hand toward the hilt of the dagger				11369.090182949445
jesus seigneur				8513168.092690242
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this note placed in a bracket against his name edmond dantès				549.6608085986056
ho there my friend the wounded man heaved a sigh				1880.9489850800333
pass on replied the guard				2520.134342559567
as grimaud entered he saw this comb on the tea table he took it up and as he took it he made a low bow				5232.971728844252
no more than a drop of water in the ocean remember chimed in la carconte those two could crush you at a single blow how so inquired the abbé				554.6582855666624
now said aramis we know how the matter stands				13868.104469422502
so d artagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply				632.9484038941451
at last cried d artagnan				5.086543266522298
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand no yes he was				534.0125548668414
where is the child villefort shrugged his shoulders				1127.9797279664865
towards the house the chestnut trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air				708.9706740097135
