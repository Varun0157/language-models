the baron knows as well as myself that milady de winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation the duke put his pen to the paper				987.8446568478371
monsieur said morrel whose uneasiness was increased by this examination you wish to speak to me yes monsieur you are aware from whom i come the house of thomson french at least so my cashier tells me he has told you rightly				14692.939295486969
it appears to me that if my boots need a sponge your stockings and shoes stand in equal need of a brush				27417.687022310914
what could explain athos s having re entered the world and the extreme sobriety he had observed at table				657.81613158887
the king looked towards him				28.692603885708344
bah said porthos why separate since we are all together because you can and ought to return to france your mission is accomplished but ours is not your mission is not accomplished exclaimed d artagnan looking in astonishment at athos				193.67527171791303
the rock yielded rolled over bounded from point to point and finally disappeared in the ocean				7567.743078415791
help help help hush				10391.09959224444
bertuccio s forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachman rue de la fontaine no				402.58498121976123
nobody but ourselves replied caderousse the fact is we do not lodge travellers indeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping here then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience you inconvenience us				253.33356761223374

now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome for my part dear mother interposed renée i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into m de villefort s hands then i shall be contented just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis				74165.5519070285
he applied his imitative powers to everything and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep houses and trees				4412.0621777443885
on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres				82022.33413732589
parliament indeed cried athos				29.362288624175818
but what are you going to fight about athos asked aramis				19.021673735765706
recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his brows and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived				26864.90248957116
at length when they found they were likely to be really in want they got together as a last effort eight or ten pistoles with which porthos went to the gaming table				664.5842919362248
it is necessary to inspire confidence in that poor little madame bonacieux that s true				650.3845855716894
d artagnan took charge of it				57.16145690059509
he was concealed in a thicket he saw my father bury something in the ground and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some treasure he turned up the ground and found me still living				3282.886885256742
why my dear fellow that on leaving us he lost his way that s all				411.64473145066876
what are you thinking of this evening bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage				568.8110458580178
worthy fellows said morrel as he went away may your new master love you as i loved you and be more fortunate than i have been august rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the old				1644.221245831317
one day you acknowledged that you loved me and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be life to me				68.92397552435536
here i am albert said				252.97251575746557
shall i call on him as i pass d avrigny said villefort be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this gentleman				746.5252204944079
well then with well acted good humor i allow grimaud but no one else you must manage it all				367.4790384662625
name a few of those whom you know and you will see if they are my friends well said milady embarrassed i know monsieur de louvigny monsieur de courtivron monsieur de ferussac the novice let her speak then seeing that she paused she said don t you know a gentleman named athos milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying and mistress as she was of herself could not help uttering a cry seizing the hand of the novice and devouring her with looks				7075.654087457689
she heard him enter but she did not raise her head				441.7444823952971
the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out francs in the course of an hour i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face				321.35173720791744
are you superhuman				2550674.1327637574
oh my king and that being led to the scaffold he had been saved by an indignant people just so madame replied chatillon in so low a voice that though the two friends were listening eagerly they could hardly hear this affirmation				2751261.1418285854
i lost him then with all his appointments and furniture really this is frightful stop a minute you don t know all yet				4329.1768789625385
are you alone athos parbleu whom do you expect to find with me at this hour well well and d artagnan rushed into athos s chamber				407.55667244284774
now said valentine you can neither go out by the front door nor by the garden morrel looked at her with astonishment				1245.1808939199034
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m noirtier				1963.6636467700625
what a dreadful death what a blow				3858.9304259397804
d artagnan unfolded the paper				1053.9059397410997
the crime which i have committed my lord has no call upon human justice and you can only deliver me from it by blessing me frequently as you have just done come be candid said the coadjutor you have not all your life followed the trade which you do now no my lord				884.5145363986483
no no				352.3795636443024
say that i am permitted to walk in those woods				164364.51929613863
his little gray eyes shone like carbuncles and appeared with his grinning mouth to be the only part of his face in which life survived				793225.0885669333
you do not believe me my lord i never believe cardinals who are not priests well on the faith of a minister you are no longer a minister my lord you are a prisoner then on the honor of a mazarin as i am and ever shall be i hope said the cardinal				379.8630347457842
now in order not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them i have if agreeable to you thought of inviting m and madame danglars and m and madame de villefort to my country house at auteuil				11802.15708612729
ah my poor friend				236.31397504270205
for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this house i will fulfil all your wishes my dear mother said the young man				91.44882216838295
he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it				47.391834025340884
still the presence of monte cristo at such an hour his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall might well seem impossibilities to her shattered reason				3239.0472774677028
what do you think d artagnan said athos				9.553769941655732
tis a long time since i saw thee come come d artagnan said athos do not affect to be strong minded there are tears in your eyes				362.74552426591254
see i have not slept said villefort showing his undisturbed bed grief does not stun me				70.23506895009604
all at once felton stopped				2577.8821108138077
there is neither happiness nor misery in the world there is only the comparison of one state with another nothing more				1626.9239651793152
but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo				186.73821530441913
i made a vow at a time when i little thought i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular smile and i made some others also which i hope i may fulfil in due season although sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness his eyes gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity				66195.61184707968
i would then rather die truly murmured valentine who on this earth cares for me if he does not				360.28355170664645
seven o clock said grimaud who had not spoken a word				544.5829203352057
the door opened and a dim light reached dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand				162.717683637029
one however fell at the duke s feet and seeing that it was intended for him he put it into his pocket				615.05162024754
you desire to fathom this horrible secret said de winter well then so be it				59.48033035683598
for i presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her at the hotel de ville my dear fellow what				497.6011302704453
as to aramis he had asked for leave of absence for five days and was gone it was said to rouen on family business				15381.55669896847
now an englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us and our masters asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion mousqueton smiled disdainfully				29930.119630227924
the count watched him with a feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in l impartial who not only surrendered the castle of yanina but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that time fernand as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name				504.1225172482479
remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored withdraw sir said buckingham or i will call my attendant and have you placed in irons you shall not call said felton throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver				3929.8768669309666
seventeen months captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited				62039.1866592383
there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity and i will say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance but sir remarked the young woman these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land				2952.678564143516
do you see cried the lieutenant				1429.9226260979333
all this looks suspicious they said a quarter of an hour				1272.4661643929242
you mean to say then my dear monsieur la ramee that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird i will continue answerable for him take care				1154.949264439506
but monsieur commissary said he calmly believe that i know and appreciate more than anybody the merit of the incomparable eminence by whom we have the honor to be governed indeed asked the commissary with an air of doubt				3242.044990104284
no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed				964.6746419867379
he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality				4889.719471406036
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty				10680.699629774052
the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done oh m de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint méran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles				1209.5225526133624
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation				757.8464300943857
as he had said it had been a long time since any one had needed him and that demand for his services on the part of mazarin seemed to him an auspicious sign				3430.0932020575374
for that purpose i mean to keep you all to myself franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day for many reasons				130074.63075693809
it is a false diamond said caderousse				206.63384305168725
all took their places or rather the ladies formed a circle while the gentlemen more indifferent to the restraints of what boileau calls the style énergique commented on the feverish agitation of andrea on m danglars riveted attention eugénie s composure and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair				1673.2187156511206
m villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m de villefort				177.19052919329368
do you know in what crime you are to day engaged				430949.95705256955
he arrived in time				293.84671736494107
my only fear is the chance of dantès being released				292441.1013046895
on the morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things				1630.6115309659315
well said the queen blinded by her obstinacy				2403609.1894298308
from lyons to avignon still by steamboat				85632.28479481941
sir said monte cristo to him i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at stay said debray i recognize this hobbema ah indeed yes it was proposed for the museum which i believe does not contain one said monte cristo				338.4954241840321
how he has shrunk since he gave up the name of porthos this can not be monsieur porthos observed planchet replying as it were to his master s thoughts				1984.0736889073553
porthos ran to him				26.748688218490713
apropos said d artagnan loud enough for the servant to hear him are you satisfied with olivain yes in some respects tolerably well olivain pretended to have heard nothing and entered the tent				7029.668983766674
it appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his journey				1930.8006502974904
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me				66.94112842199526
monsieur de chavigny be so good as to lend me your cane monsieur de chavigny handed his cane to monsieur de beaufort				1050.3188862199531
dantès instantly turned to meet him				25.108113046956586
maximilian said he return home				1859.6709640427096
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d artagnan and porthos				188.79326137179376
why there is nothing improper in our conversation my dear planchet and no one could find fault with it ah monsieur replied planchet recurring to his besetting idea that monsieur bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows and something very unpleasant in the play of his lips what the devil makes you think of bonacieux monsieur we think of what we can and not of what we will because you are a coward planchet monsieur we must not confound prudence with cowardice prudence is a virtue and you are very virtuous are you not planchet monsieur is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder				12502.970591270661
he had not long to wait for the queen scarcely remained a quarter of an hour with mazarin but this quarter of an hour of expectation appeared a century to him				31.244348220565296
and aramis i see you have not forgotten the name no she said poor aramis a charming man elegant discreet and a writer of poetical verses				1325387.7981978606
but excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile quite the contrary				66148.4081523729
read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse which leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow				1712864.6309460835
two lackeys dragged milady whom each held by one arm				1642.72835486329
yes i am vice president father your coolness makes me shudder why my dear boy when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a hay cart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierre s bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most things				1548.9404935634357
did you see him they all asked				836.4829061116232
no but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices of the rocks where can i sleep on shore in the grottos or on board in your cloak besides if your excellency pleases we can leave as soon as you like we can sail as well by night as by day and if the wind drops we can use our oars as franz had sufficient time and his apartments at rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition				88214.23743409908
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass				1043.2360825734372
oh as i told you before i think the old fellow is very close come you do not flatter him i scarcely know him i think i have seen him three times in my life all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself				192.8091096318298
well asked the young girl with an authoritative tone the count had never observed before and which startled him				26.420799601516805
he would no doubt have believed that he had returned to the times of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the sabine hill				1375768.981080778
now leave me and desire my valet de chambre to come hither scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber				407.9068258103891
oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle andrea bit his lips				406.5568649127576
it may be imagined that d artagnan listened to these details with increasing interest before grimaud had finished he rose without noise and putting his mouth to aramis s ear and at the same time touching him on the shoulder to prevent a sudden movement chevalier he said get up and don t make the least noise aramis awoke				13790.305373622294
speak comte de la fere my lord replied athos for myself i have nothing to demand				19794.830144904347
why thou art posted here by heaven no sir said the honest servant it was monsieur aramis who posted me here to take care of the horses is aramis here yes sir he has been here since yesterday what are you doing on the watch what				559.9526626339857
my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the of september that is to say precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled my life the abbé busoni whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the prison doors saying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him he added that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my desire				22243.70358027022
the road was long but the horses upon which d artagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for d artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant				2483.3358024192175
your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides				102955.41560601754
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the impresari i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me				70.33591476800618
he watched them pass through the crowd for some time but at length he lost sight of them in the via macello				81581.48723783199
come come signor pastrini no joking we must have a carriage sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you one this is all i can say and when shall we know inquired franz				472.4226866277137
bonacieux looked at the young man restrained for a minute by a last hesitation but there was such an ardor in his eyes such persuasion in his voice that she felt herself constrained to confide in him				28.585266997838033
then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand come i had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson i only wanted a murder and here it is				4246.690222651777
say to him that when he is alone it will help us if he will knock on the floor for then i can continue my work in safety				7677.107993161541
at this moment villefort returned				1814.6013875232898
he showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers as he felt some self reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice				7773.376104893543
franz questioned albert as to his intentions but albert had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any answer he inquired if signor pastrini could procure him a tailor				1999480.7024412688
i am entirely at your service except only for my orders thank you sir what i am about to ask will not compromise you in any degree if it should even compromise me a little said monsieur de comminges with a smile still make your demand				18711.686835192457
as a further precaution they had bound his hands				391.1206480331404
upon hearing d artagnan s reply aramis seemed about to draw his sword when athos prevented him				30.890553940590944
a ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing				1051.3049843839935
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground				1015.3754120013558
au revoir benedetto and running into a court he disappeared				389.03814825784696
i am parched with thirst				143266.56611092397
are not your name your social position and your merit sufficient no said andrea no it is useless for you to say so count				205.30746134676954
true i forgot provided he can get money out of the people that is all he wants the street of saint honore when the cardinal and his party passed through it was crowded by an assemblage who standing in groups discussed the edicts of that memorable day				290.9165846282792
at least you don t speak well of him that is because i am not his friend said she sighing but his victim but this letter in which he recommends you to me is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison from which he will release me by one of his satellites but why have you not fled whither should i go				1372.7184733527922
ay but it is for the first time madame i did not say france my lord i said the cardinal and the cardinal is not even a frenchman but did you see the queen it is useless replied henrietta the queen will not say yes when the cardinal says no				294.98020284463416
for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop				92403.30258635253
the peasants were in great commotion				59888.07584155203
why did you leave the closet monsieur d artagnan asked the cardinal				239.35805921995805
i believe that not a stone in paris will remain unturned put in the marechal				48193.249731364675
from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash				1264455.0855794125
well said he on perceiving aramis				88.71210801064778
but come i am waiting for you both men entered monte cristo s carriage which in the course of a few minutes deposited them safely at no				454.9062884525549
m de villefort answered nothing but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his chair				311.6799119572395
where is morrel he asked do either of these gentlemen know where he is we have already asked that question said château renaud for none of us has seen him the count was silent but continued to gaze around him				31.291410637970348
the swiss were drawn up along the road but as the road was long they were placed at six or eight feet distant from each other and one deep only				4442.987030466436
good so much the better said caderousse his eyes sparkling with avarice				8085.345110817727
for you hear that instead of becoming calmer the noise increases madame said d artagnan the people want to see the king and they must see him what				505.4661300388336
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one				1189.248200305634

d artagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep				886.7865688311553

they looked hesitatingly around them and appeared to doubt the thickness of the partition between them and the office of m de tréville but a fresh allusion soon brought back the conversation to his eminence and then the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from any of his actions				4063.799209524754
your death said he oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after i have had the happiness to possess you only a single time				326.1260285812861
no replied athos and he oh he				91.56314179882197
it was evident either that he no longer possessed the confidence of his friend or that athos was bound by some invisible chain or that he had been forewarned of the lieutenant s visit				1743.4490845693588
while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate				5664.162742097772
a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man s shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size				106631.38638014632
he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth				3861.4374308329234
i should think so but not without difficulty				11256.725446164523

mazarin is better lodged said aramis				18.697499300531486
athos immediately profited by the permission and the door was closed behind him				30.939200425754485
the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward				2203092.0941752647

yes said aramis				20.118016617443175

well before dying i wish to see my son in law				1791.8049053109212
i mean as i love				1089.5975120574087
he began to reflect upon the events that had passed they were numerous and inauspicious				1313005.8252146484
i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen				1525.3816556131683

d artagnan retired to bed not to sleep but to think over all he had heard that evening				676.5884197670464
surely said albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the countess g and who is the countess g inquired château renaud				2138.653184176851

i valued it much said mazarin giving a last look at it nevertheless i give it to you with great pleasure and i my lord said d artagnan accept it as it is given				2312.1024749375

maximilian said the count without appearing to notice the different impressions which his presence produced on the little circle i come to seek you to seek me repeated morrel as if awakening from a dream				1406.0758867684192
all very fine my lord but at the very first hint you give of such a thing i will strangle you and become frondist				3949299.451469438

a sacerdotal officer				2230.3019813889323
but tell me my dear sister replied he what makes you come to england i come to see you replied milady without knowing how much she aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which d artagnan s letter had given birth in the mind of her brother in law and only desiring to gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood				6905.467838542058
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into reverie				7826.636745044737
how many guns gentlemen twelve replied aramis				16.46287561900622
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return				2452.6456565330905
look at me well in your turn				870.3962389148503
there is then the second point cleared up or nearly so said eugénie without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language and you appear satisfied with the explanation				6561.770704348768
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me				46.87285917226106
these people who are looking at us are only merchants said athos and are looking more at the cargo than at us i shall not trust to that said the lieutenant and i shall make for the dunes as soon as possible sandy hills about dunkirk from which it derives its name				515.1431623130529
just heaven what have i read cried the duke				813.0261107334704

we are and have been these ten years connected with the house of morrel son of marseilles				1212.7450766357222
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation				725.004474041773
go then said the duke and return as soon as possible does your highness wish to take revenge for the game of tennis yesterday grimaud intimated by a scarcely perceptible nod that he should consent				121923.74935690097
signor pastrini interpreted the question and answer and the horses galloped off				1699.4351731609313
what do you say that she wanted to have her brother in law killed yes she was married asked aramis				79.23898967241144
at last do you imagine he resumed that they mean to kill you				60.843934198762696
his voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blue veined lids and he tottered like a drunken man				122.92271965530344
what do you think of the count inquired debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the count oh he is so dreadfully pale i quite agree with you said morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out				385.74125339850394
confiteor said caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger i was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller s shop it is another branch of industry paralyzed have you finished said andrea do you want anything more will you have my waistcoat or my hat				2579.2924232382534
my intention was if caderousse was alone to acquaint him with my presence finish the meal the custom house officers had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to return to the rhône and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew				73391.80096453159
i confess i am accustomed to priests of a very different appearance ah exclaimed de guiche you must understand that this is one of those wandering brothers who go begging on the high road until some day a benefice falls down from heaven on them they are mostly foreigners scotch irish or danish				2051074.8109006835

sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe your swords but it was too late				3280.1172918500874
i will offer six millions and i will content myself with the rest if they will only give me my liberty on my word said the inspector in a low tone had i not been told beforehand that this man was mad i should believe what he says i am not mad replied faria with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to prisoners				14173.749146987835
winter approached				3616.2624413735057
five minutes afterward he entered the hotel of la chevrette where pretty madeleine the hostess came to him				29.464793663335314
he s not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do				953.4021996916517
but added the queen in awaiting the cardinal s decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only the deputies bowed and left the room				91.52088798563037
all this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of september				7104.343303516189
you make me young and happy again by it				56.341704331576466
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp				1498.3538407620892
save me				49.41238405898254

tomorrow i will come and announce to you the departure of my messenger lord de winter rose saluted her ironically and went out				375.96490883285156
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least do you repent asked a deep solemn voice which caused danglars hair to stand on end				1050.1345965548078
it was delightful weather				98390.57410785856
i assure you i intend to play the devil s game to night d artagnan rattled the gold in his pockets				49051.721904206745
the abbé took the note				30432.80811515156
nevertheless when the name of the king was now and then uttered unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests a sort of gag seemed to close for a moment on all these jeering mouths				250455.36386936082
madame said d artagnan rising i have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall be my life and with this conclusion a way peculiar to himself he rose and left the room				91.62039888224082
i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the bed and i dared not turn around				1406.3266646212958
i fix on boulogne because i presume that every town in france is indifferent to you if you prefer another name it but you can easily conceive that surrounded as i am by influences i can only muzzle by discretion i desire your presence in paris to be unknown i go sir said mordaunt advancing a few steps to the door by which he had entered				896.1314591875358
behind the grating of the room into which andrea had been led he saw while his eyes dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent face of m bertuccio who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars the bolted doors and the shadow which moved behind the other grating				122540.75177588905
the voices soon ceased and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the cell				2484.1079861531725
remember it is you who have ruined me yes yes to be sure kitty said d artagnan be at ease my girl				1280.0372899827444
good news				13915.002407641305
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows				2037.3122079166603
i speak to you when i can catch you				54.360622434316895
had i been alone i should scarcely have gone to rueil without great caution				3310603.155850032
it is a quarter of an hour s journey from here to the city consequently a quarter of an hour s journey from the city to hither				102276.64535732917
my apartment will be close to his				826.5901602371941
d artagnan would fain have declared that he was not fatigued but athos insisted on his retiring to his chamber conducted thither by raoul				1793.9498756498208
monsieur d artagnan monsieur du vallon you are free the order was obeyed d artagnan and porthos then found themselves in the centre of a large circle				66009.45399994981
is your name bonacieux said he				21.45225981047007
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared				404.90619931614714
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed d artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock				14030.493432393512
we shall go out all the same do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked what then why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at and what have master pastrycooks to do with us we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us				256.1732802923674
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms				614.7619283788606
it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him				30.228252446007257
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body				1234.8547249637872
de chevreuse and consequently the queen				403.17110024474096
d artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder				1473.2443408033357
chapter xxxvi				1777281.3728350054
monsieur d artagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns				1333465.1813446514
in this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night while m de tréville in his office contiguous to this antechamber received visits listened to complaints gave his orders and like the king in his balcony at the louvre had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms				605.3862129815237
this demanded new effort but nothing compared to the first at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus				1600773.312477913
the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands				407.91849628523363
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles				1210.5293919840115
i had acted hastily towards him				28.527565994891024
no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor i am a royalist replied the general i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii and i will adhere to it these words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness				1931689.4938215506
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple				166795.49081303648
bonacieux my punishment is drawing to a close				31223.865094526467
this operation proved as great a success as the first				1033.376674264544
the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door				194.05548643222602
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word				525.6179025405165
ah i had eighty louis before me put down the same sum so that they who have lost may have nothing to complain of				8771.446520716414
afterward mme				106.55564281282209
yes yes yes continued the old man				107.93060927836412
what promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience i have evinced none whatever				7744.089693271586
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole				780950.3610375169
besides we must try our own arms bah let us enjoy that pleasure said aramis with his mild and careless manner				990.5082100593446
the count had just opened a door				182.82535989917193
although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x in who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat pocket but at his button hole ah interrupted morcerf laughing beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the corsaire or the charivari but spare my future father in law before me then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron i do not know him returned monte cristo but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance for i have a credit opened with him by the house of richard blount of london arstein eskeles of vienna and thomson french at rome as he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at maximilian morrel				507.7157875964208
at that moment their fraternal bond of union was closer than ever and when they parted each to take the route agreed on they turned back to utter affectionate expressions which the echoes of the dunes repeated				3467.2509475740944
well said porthos to aramis we must do something monsieur is full of generosity said athos				61.34123039557394
at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her lips				409.88349276252154
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that d artagnan heard her in the antechamber				8036.613885405537
have you wanted money father i want nothing now that i have you said the old man				91.33386134162367
three or four times he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation at such a period i was five years old at another ten years old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate				2600646.8277452076
let us hear				32828.97948064295
as little sensitive as was the heart of d artagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance				15457.464743398152

in matters of speculation however though man proposes yet money disposes from some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchen garden having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market gardeners at a yearly rental of francs				669.4639757271027

at the end of the second day m de villefort received the following note the person called the count of monte cristo is an intimate acquaintance of lord wilmore a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this moment he is also known to the abbé busoni a sicilian priest of high repute in the east where he has done much good m de villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two persons his orders were executed and the following evening he received these details the abbé who was in paris only for a month inhabited a small two storied house behind saint sulpice there were two rooms on each floor and he was the only tenant				82309.44304452618

buckingham at once remembered the circumstance and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards he put his horse into a gallop and rode straight up to d artagnan				191.47658135325676
athos who had been observing him and guessing his thoughts took his arm and led him into the garden				2553.025994938453

it is this i swear by my honor not to reveal to anyone what i have seen and heard on the of february between nine and ten o clock in the evening and i plead guilty of death should i ever violate this oath the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some moments then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did				2209.9350454097244
the mob had already assembled when the confession terminated				137804.52316906146

his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de méré or a vitry				2266719.920658395
he put in his pocket the key of the room where he had hidden them and accompanied by porthos returned to settle with mousqueton who naively and like the worthy steward that he was handed them four hundred and thirty louis and kept one hundred for himself				200.89378522429877
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals				1808721.220889587
this agitation in one so cold and calm as athos frightened him				25.068551252090877
these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union				70618.78469560467
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud				19362.24662077735
the king rose immediately took his book closed it and went to lay it down on the table near which he continued standing in order that mazarin might be obliged to stand also				1286.8671683494333

and now our readers must leave the standard to sail peaceably not toward london where d artagnan and porthos believed they were going but to durham whither mordaunt had been ordered to repair by the letter he had received during his sojourn at boulogne and accompany us to the royalist camp on this side of the tyne near newcastle				47702.8793981155

i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real marriage feast this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree that the elder dantès who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the silence that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of voices to obtain a moment s tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom				1123797.6580272962
the young man was thrown from the top of the rock the corpse was found on the bed next day and the whole truth was guessed for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the moment the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared the count breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his forehead and his heart was full of anguish				9975.255485424039
the last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived gondy				1542.8995397291835
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès				584.4455633572535
why this count of monte cristo must be a nabob indeed i do not know what he is he has three unlimited credits one on me one on rothschild one on lafitte and you see he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of francs m de boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration				3117.6360653571387
i see they kept their promise no monsieur returned monte cristo upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my friends				292.28368021821797

ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy which is the young man asked de winter turning around				1389.4560700874877
now if you have them andrea took five and twenty louis from his pocket				601.6098159433438
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step				2117.6726297223886
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven o clock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity				2015.7411781417038
here we are without occupation it seems to me you forget my friend that we have work cut out for us in the direction of charenton i hope to see monsieur de chatillon whom i ve hated for a long time there why have you hated him because he is the brother of coligny ah true				651.9569690775611
this man named emery was the object of popular detestation in the first place because he was superintendent of finance and every superintendent of finance deserved to be hated in the second place because he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred				70069.96001239473
do you know him				32.03666527599791
d artagnan took out the parcel which he had desired bernouin to place under the seat				3111.2502140650518
a most affectionate greeting as one can well believe took place between him and lord de winter				838.772334121368
they saw no one and the bastion seemed abandoned				6212788.340875286
it was for this i had annulled the lease it was for this i had come it was for this i was waiting				6904.6249373727005

he and the count de guiche are like each other s shadows thanks planchet thanks cried athos extending his hand to the lieutenant				2037.590066185538

porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos				193.51769173512608
yes yes said felton i understand how he would act				1028.9617086225778
there are hours which last a year				652.1665340574831
one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event				2728.7571918002673
milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life she resolved then to risk something in order that she might know how to act afterward				171536.15885726392
at this moment planchet entered to inform his master that the horses were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at clermont				1798089.0699374957
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well it is a forgery how can that be yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you but it is d artagnan that will come do not deceive yourself				920.5152143586992
the priest heard a burst of laughter and then the master or rather the mistress replied thank you monsieur le curé i accept sup then and make as little noise as possible said the priest for i too have been on the go all day and shall not be sorry to sleep to night madame de chevreuse evidently went from surprise to astonishment and from astonishment to stupefaction				7374.438702605996
well here i am be satisfied				2045.2353091193631
one by one the several groups broke up				1034.6793464800464

grimaud speaks				10091.48356686461
the man who lives to see shall see and slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court				1528.7924110999934
it was one of those events which decide the life of a man it was a choice between the king and the cardinal the choice made it must be persisted in				587.676902271806
he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover porthos with ridicule				8404.871307586089
and i see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy father s head yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but i feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man				120.97359285171196

you are saying to yourself fifteen days twenty days				1727.4753304095716
he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the traveler s abandoning his purse to save his life				487.7975183104347
bertuccio cried he striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong				10854.091267956564
adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my door noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation				720.9025297663478
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room				92.41505884487513
as to what may lie before us it is perhaps less serious than we at first thought				1378.000461274986

her head hung back and her long hair swept the ground				997.3309918073147
he saw d artagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance				728.5427697986709
the prisoners he exclaimed jumping off his horse				937.818472458308
here it is at last he said not without some trouble though yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting as he said this the man came towards edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence				5894.1239733526545
ah said d artagnan there are two of them then i wish there were four said athos the two parties would then be equal perhaps there are four said d artagnan				51.55516832441408
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m noirtier i resolved to try one last means and for three months i have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains				1611779.7169751518
ah he muttered to himself this changes the situation and if there is still a crowd of people in the streets we will try to show mazarin that we are still thank god good for something else than keeping guard over a prisoner and he jumped into the carriage with the alacrity of a man of five and twenty				4519.491929137119
they sat down to dinner				3363.2423805479284
it seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his hand and head cut off the tongue the first day the hand the second and the head the third				23743.694714576643

in the morning as he was mounting his horse d artagnan who felt at the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke took planchet aside				5513.4055715840905
these attempts did not prevent the cardinal to whom his most inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery from making nocturnal excursions sometimes to communicate to the duc d angoulême important orders sometimes to confer with the king and sometimes to have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home				2183.7500938372223
do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it i shall never forget it replied d artagnan				45.02375231883296

franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet				72321.25085389
i wish that this event which on the day it is known will completely change the aspect of affairs should be accomplished without the knowledge of any others but yourself myself and a third person and who is this third person monsieur le prince he has come then as they told me last evening and you have seen him he has just left me and will he aid this project the plan is his own and paris he will starve it out and force it to surrender at discretion the plan is not wanting in grandeur i see but one impediment what is it impossibility a senseless word				566.4127449611194
his room like all those on the same floor had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody				5169.8211658507635

franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows				2040.0740135663411
but he was not listened to and his cries only served to arouse the attention of the spaniards				30576.957335271745

to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death				444.8963184701289
it is the count s reply poor kitty became as pale as death she suspected what the letter contained				373515.6484420993
we have no litmus paper but see here they come with the syrup of violets the doctor was right steps were heard in the passage				2832.0259980891406

hallo fernand				3025.225593078864
he again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening				3047.6241984887956
i ask pardon of your eminence said d artagnan but i was so fatigued don t ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service d artagnan admired mazarin s gracious manner				1032.7225062261743
how can i tell				13694.946577127428
and they pursued their road in mournful silence				467.9650581143408
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape d artagnan appeared to authorize the issue				1242212.8450228765
just as he turned a hand rested on his shoulder and a voice which made him shudder exclaimed good evening maximilian you are punctual thank you ah is it you count said the young man in an almost joyful accent pressing monte cristo s hand with both his own				697.9158691177445
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night				525.8778744210696
at the third he fell again				240.7740789766863
it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail				29690.745000844552

these gentlemen wage war on private account and in buying them up by granting them what they wished monsieur le cardinal has made a good bargain				228759.26643734323
had you then that sum the queen s famous diamond answered d artagnan with a sigh				1955.818719334055
i said milady with a smile which might have disarmed the angel of the last judgment				82667.22001411843
she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her eyes were more brilliant than ever and her hands which were generally white like mother of pearl now more resembled wax to which time was adding a yellowish hue				95399.61761913373
he had not been more than ten minutes in the drawing room before he drew danglars aside into the recess of a bow window and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father s departure				2199.0385231359824
he picked up the paper and recognizing his wife s writing ran his eyes rapidly over its contents it ran as follows you know that i was a good mother since it was for my son s sake i became criminal				35597.002304824324
we have all wished for this interview and i trust it will convince you how ill formed are your objections to valentine s marriage noirtier answered only by a look which made villefort s blood run cold				5695.18872562519
the pardon the next day danglars was again hungry certainly the air of that dungeon was very provocative of appetite				12288.580616415802
to be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful punishment is no impediment to beauty but it is an obstacle to the recovery of power				1759.2098007687405
do said aramis				19.99675844764597
he was the same man or rather the development of the same man whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles				1207.786066746503
at the sound of that carriage i shuddered soon i heard steps on the staircase which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan				2623076.934566406
beware monsieur there is certainly some magic underneath meanwhile the young man had darted in to his chamber and opened the letter				635.162143287963
nevertheless to d artagnan s great astonishment the pretty kitty defended herself resolutely				39366.98321527679
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me i had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant				2461.2906901053993
but what do i see in the water something struggling oh yes exclaimed raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider they are sinking cried olivain in his turn				867.6166167663813
i don t know such a place and that name of a town or village is written in her hand cried athos				80.78754559263177
franz and the count got into the carriage				567.886360690795
what cried he in an accent of greater astonishment than before your second witness is monsieur aramis doubtless				94723.3141900057
the cardinal therefore rose to open it				47.36219447576633
the count had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let				159713.2611033616
he will not return till after the taking of the city ah you fancy so				330.3818476898251
an officer who saw me with a jealous eye reading the lives of the saints to the mistress of the house entered suddenly and without being announced				1346.7326876162228
now will you make me a report of all that has happened why i have related the events to you				74.4657266077857
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror				565.1310157140921
the writing of madame de chevreuse said milady to herself				843.4375695058261
and these judges i warn you will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders alike the eyes of milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and armed before an unarmed woman he felt the chill of fear glide through his whole frame				12182.884342988445
oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings morrel again changed color				3231.642164304389
but the night was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was non capisco danglars therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting house				406.04055235515693
i know you are accustomed to assassinate people but i warn you i shall defend myself even against you you are right said milady				385.5786884488729
therefore after the connection had continued three years carefully fostered by d artagnan who found his bed and his mistress more agreeable every year each doing credit to the other the mistress conceived the extraordinary desire of becoming a wife and proposed to d artagnan that he should marry her				131.33268806774277
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start				18321.70450937232
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride				4071.41013905449
you already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a judge				10829.576138144934
can we have destroyed them all from the first to the last said athos				90.86844175603348
but asked morrel will the house of thomson french consent oh i take everything on myself				756.6194913519379
perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the notary it is probable stammered out villefort trying to smile but i can assure you that i had nothing to do with any such proceeding				861394.1405520218
bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold and forgot that he came to announce d artagnan who curious to know who the mendicant could be came to aramis on leaving athos				181.3941249077999
why didn t they search more vigilantly				3114704.6723069595
did i not see you the other day smile on the duke of orleans				36082.41083209466
could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida and the chinese eat swallows nests				2125555.713741022
you must look out for yourself what have i to fear replied d artagnan as long as i shall have the luck to enjoy the favor of their majesties everything believe me				33.996416797983514
when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos porthos drew his dripping hand from the font				52222.258125653774
we were beginning to grow impatient said athos				9.512211090527819
my lord duke tis the height of ingratitude but your highness has never seriously thought of it yes returned the duke i must confess i sometimes think of it still by one of your forty methods your highness yes yes indeed my lord said la ramee now we are quite at our ease and enjoying ourselves pray tell me one of those forty ways invented by your highness willingly answered the duke give me the pie i am listening said la ramee leaning back in his armchair and raising his glass of madeira to his lips and winking his eye that he might see the sun through the rich liquid that he was about to taste				12159.321595690237
the road selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the travellers would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum				13244.350088909669
yet in spite of all this seduction milady might fail for felton was forewarned and that against the least chance				22354.009302032893
to the boat but porthos i do not see him porthos is coming he swims like leviathan in fact porthos did not appear for a scene half tragedy and half comedy had been performed by him with mousqueton and blaisois who frightened by the noise of the sea by the whistling of the wind by the sight of that dark water yawning like a gulf beneath them shrank back instead of going forward				1967.5345734845725
without divulging his secret dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent				1702933.9890515418
what took place at armentieres has no connection whatever with the present occasion				4176.750607167759
whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk or as a place for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion				2333867.451892232
porthos opened his mouth to reply d artagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed				3612.46048488563
you may madame said he with emphasis				7021706.449556913
let me look at you and while saying these words she absolutely devoured her by her looks				6736.117185288566
as the stranger asked the question he dragged the table beneath the window				535.7721884766911
oh cried madame de villefort it is really frightful madame danglars tried to utter a few words but was not heard				549.7011732801197
during this passage felton related everything to milady how instead of going to london he had chartered the little vessel how he had returned how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones as he ascended to give him foothold and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder				3178.601460078063
we shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escalade				1645893.7966396143
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger				16800.295016935535
wait whilst i light the lamp said la carconte it is growing dark and there may be some mistake in fact night had come on during this conversation and with night the storm which had been threatening for the last half hour				1388.2057493761251
i am quite ready said d artagnan but in the first place i should like to be certain of one thing and what is that asked milady				606.9609351639468
anne then motioned to d artagnan to approach and he obeyed				1557.1620889311635
the waking chapter				327.96558152989303
about half a mile from this on the same road there is an inn and about a mile further on after leaving the inn you will reach the village of greney				31025.82103069349
the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news				11641.941900998172
during this time the abbé had chosen his place for listening at his ease				9827.770825651956
athos took her hand and kissed it				38.19896562427713
i have however a wish to go and pass a day at blois				5688.479525562755
well you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know what he says replied athos shrugging his shoulders as if he thought himself an object of pity				1754.5126138593312
where has he gone i do not know what do you mean				2925.3062113672077
you conducted him to the wounded man and you had time to observe him and perhaps you would know him again were you to meet him yes yes cried both young men				852.9818665964674
he almost believed in the tenderness of milady he almost believed in the crime of de wardes				7509.724127106497
speak madame resumed mme				81.98553079829459
but my lieutenant said a soldier less stoical than his chief and who had approached milady this woman is not asleep what not asleep said felton what is she doing then she has fainted				3297.9775040470117
andrea assumed his gayest manner				973.820056458139
however monte cristo only made a sign to apprise ali who understanding that danger was approaching from the other side drew nearer to his master				1054.7787129945677
you will go to london continued the cardinal				351.0462724236909
the celebrated cucumetto pursued in the abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the garigliano like manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno				1572615.1078104049
at the royal arms of england you will find a young gentleman named mordaunt yes my lord and what am i to do with this young gentleman follow wherever he leads you d artagnan looked at the cardinal with a stupefied air				686.9282865338561
five months after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercédès arms				613.4564923261412
believe me dear albert he said with all the emotion he was capable of feeling believe me i feel deeply for your misfortunes and if in any way i can serve you i am yours thank you sir said albert smiling				598.3366736679901
but the next moment the unfortunate man was nearly killed with heavy blows of sword hilts and among those who set upon him the king recognized captain groslow				2802.529612656997
the queen looked at him surprised				3671.8268457691665
i will make you all captains with good pensions				2976732.511792088
a terrible fear transfixed him				25.72278454241484
condé himself whilst fighting for him lost no opportunity of ridiculing of humbling him				31.784284745282456
a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlord s hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m franz d épinay				5064.458971979571
well said porthos if any one had told you in the old times that the day would come when planchet would rescue rochefort and that you would protect him in it i should not have believed him but men are changed by events there is nothing truer than that said porthos but what does not change or changes for the better is wine				1881.2934286594304
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon				2621156.4390320447
apply to the steward on the first day of every month and you will receive the same sum there now again you degrade me how so by making me apply to the servants when i want to transact business with you alone well be it so then				925.2701550589474
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist				2619669.521840039
you shall relate them to me my child				1180.9643932802676
nay do not press my hand edmond you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness				10246.599327759235
otherwise his head was perfectly clear and his body refreshed he was free from the slightest headache on the contrary he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure air and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever				2204.719733345431
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled				1698744.244848416
come said d artagnan to himself i have got one more enemy and now said the queen addressing d artagnan what is to be done				918.7734111330543
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else				2305.3661319445714
i advise you to complain said porthos				11.338013927091646
the moon is just bursting through the clouds and there standing where you do and wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure you remind me of m de villefort what cried monte cristo it was m de villefort your excellency knows him the former royal attorney at nîmes yes who married the marquis of saint méran s daughter yes who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most rigid magistrate on the bench well monsieur said bertuccio this man with this spotless reputation well was a villain bah replied monte cristo impossible it is as i tell you ah really said monte cristo				314.172982284814
they had understood each other without speaking				2035.1625167633704
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections				44905.11451747468
rise said the count your life is safe the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplices one is mad the other dead				668.0283649070201
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary d artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach				219415.87365437218
athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly				1840597.8688943766
it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the hôtel des postes when chance brought us together you madame de villefort and her son i now remember having had the honor of meeting you i perfectly well remember perugia sir and the hôtel des postes and the festival of which you speak said madame de villefort but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count				247.30986182062375
your majesty continued the coadjutor pitilessly is about to take such measures as seem good to you but i foresee that they will be violent and such as will still further exasperate the rioters in that case you monsieur le coadjuteur who have such power over them and are at the same time friendly to us said the queen ironically will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them perhaps it will be too late said gondy still unmoved perhaps i shall have lost all influence while by giving up broussel your majesty will strike at the root of the sedition and will gain the right to punish severely any revival of the revolt have i not then that right cried the queen				411.7707673188561
i depend on you				66.29836457191868
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine o clock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis				3676.72552487894
poor young creature				14364.97042514243
you offer me your services with the same frankness i accept them				64.10020727262324
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination				1420.258978141901
rest assured we shall not see her and you say that we are going from here to the palais royal immediately				1645.1160626534643
ah true said aramis				21.105694886508658
how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme				205.7282669919628
soon as kitty left him d artagnan directed his steps toward the rue férou				105520.23558720491

we can go to brussels liège aix la chapelle then up the rhine to strasbourg				2918358.4159324705
as the carriage stopped at the door and albert was alighting a man approached and gave him a letter				616.4045378456552
but that act of self control effective as it was did not escape the eyes of the young princess				4684.33238259666
this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find d artagnan				151.7587573212473
willingly replied de chatillon				20354.469409571004
the two women who thus knelt in united prayer were the daughter and grand daughter of henry iv the wife and daughter of charles i				1253.2641853146595
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happy				1933.2226292173495
breathe not a word of that or the comte de la fere will be furious you think the count will be angry with me think it				50.43358873797891
let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone my dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me said athos				51.97717658415116
do not seek your wife read d artagnan she will be restored to you when there is no longer occasion for her				145.2584647766221
the blow was sped by d artagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom				3492.2194910622734
you have told me yourself madame that i have been drawn into a snare i perhaps may leave my life in it for although it may be strange i have for some time had a presentiment that i should shortly die and the duke smiled with a smile at once sad and charming				2777.371494692911
i persist then madame in my wish he laid an emphasis on the word that your majesty should receive the coadjutor and wherefore do you not say like the rest your will replied the queen in a low voice				167.2989694054222
bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband she took him on his weak side				1111.9481085474154
between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of morcerf				1061.4437535711081
yes yes said he you disturb you agitate the people who live in the castle the poor senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his words while milady was reading with her lynx s eyes the very depths of his heart				327.4012008286603
i bear the traces of our friendship three slits or slashes from your sword well if you should be restored to favor don t forget me on the honor of a rochefort but you must do the like for me there s my hand i promise therefore whenever you find any opportunity of saying something in my behalf i shall say it and you i shall do the same apropos are we to speak of your friends also athos porthos and aramis				156.98719863683453
now this was a sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him				29.235915040026057
my intention was to inform monsieur laporte through my husband in order that monsieur laporte might tell us precisely what had taken place at the louvre in the last three days and whether there is any danger in presenting myself there but i said d artagnan can go and inform monsieur laporte no doubt you could only there is one misfortune and that is that monsieur bonacieux is known at the louvre and would be allowed to pass whereas you are not known there and the gate would be closed against you ah bah said d artagnan you have at some wicket of the louvre a concierge who is devoted to you and who thanks to a password would mme				190.36310270753026
this way gentlemen this way he cried directing his course toward the gate that had been pointed out				369.7737706414298
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit search then monsieur				1313.5129300366054
on perceiving the count he rose quickly				2648.5339802577614
at the first cross street andrea stopped his horse and caderousse leaped out				356.7118558716406
well resumed the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of caderousse s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine				1860.466558092755
and that diamond cried caderousse almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand francs it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the abbé as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper				420983.07097307045
you left it to me to discover the means and i have done so porthos looked at d artagnan with an expression of profound admiration				3217.256988503761
porthos fired the flash threw a gleam of light over the field of battle				1026.1145043586932
it is for a consultation which will last three hours at least				2118.3765668387314
has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command				6683.243761852784
he was a strong minded upright young man				113.6790769477058
during the evening monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil accompanied by ali				3170.4152476985023
aramis rushed to the hotel de ville where madame de longueville was sojourning				1660513.6795616434
he replied he replied that the death was not a natural one and must be attributed to what to poison indeed said monte cristo with a slight cough which in moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense interest with which he listened indeed maximilian did you hear that yes my dear count i heard it and the doctor added that if another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice monte cristo listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness				30041.73284183639
death is depicted on his face				347.80173661914864
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them				77.310023696303
bravo bravo said franz things go wonderfully				23798024.807611253
it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill				1371140.0522597148
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded				3306.303896588626
let us draw lots cried all the brigands when they saw the chief				43780.42595730772
they are quite new and have not yet been used				3264.339365999212
d artagnan he cried				1657.0388074149832
if the king had desired that the letter should be given to him madame he would have demanded it of you himself				164.44203478602074
who knows if tomorrow or the next day after the third attack may not come on				909.9136672130766
king s attorney said the president stupefied and without noticing the agitation which spread over the face of m de villefort king s attorney yes and if you wish to know his name i will tell it he is named villefort the explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience				8675.136363721882
bonacieux he will rouse the whole quarter bonacieux called a long time but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer s house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac				2326904.5860952754
the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the door and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de vaugirard				20122.148765788468
ruined said she				140.30760148090923
in order to go from the door to the house or from the house to the door m de villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these clumps of trees				4345.159314724889
are you satisfied well said felton till tonight and he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldier s half pike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his place				464.6998689822486
athos with his superior understanding wisely deemed that the supper table would be the most complete and satisfactory point of reunion and at the moment when his friends in deference to his deportment and sobriety dared scarcely speak of some of their former good dinners he was the first to propose that they should all assemble around some well spread table and abandon themselves unreservedly to their own natural character and manners a freedom which had formerly contributed so much to that good understanding between them which gave them the name of the inseparables				89890.9903468424
since you now know my face i wish to be remembered alone through the affection i hope you will grant me				57.8248069486898
thanks my lord i will speak to him myself				653.3692577686164

bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits				4808362.362027084
i will take the whole world as a witness of your crime and that until i have found an avenger you are a prostitute said he in a voice of thunder and you shall undergo the punishment of prostitutes				1660551.6861385503
dead repeated a third voice				185.53388141299928
and who cares now about yanina which was taken as long ago as the year or that just shows the meanness of this slander				1035984.2542148577
then said he you are ready to pay the official visits which are absolutely indispensable yes replied eugénie				2507.2085398090344
then i renewed the search				3015.5443632773763
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast				19171.321485368884
he went the first time to save the honor of a great queen the second to avert the death of a great king sir said anne to mazarin with an accent from which daily habits of dissimulation could not entirely chase the real expression see if we can do something for these gentlemen i wish to do madame all that your majesty pleases do what monsieur de la fere requests that is your name is it not sir i have another name madame i am called athos madame said mazarin with a smile you may rest easy your wishes shall be fulfilled you hear sir said the queen				432.8565747204236
two hours after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded				2472627.273315282
here it is said he				21.99406466015529
twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the half hour				1354.6442790940519
what are you saying to her said morcerf in an undertone				29377.15029373896
athos came down last and found d artagnan already on horseback and growing impatient				2525556.442308537
then replied mme				49.3209199821983
heaven grant that this light prove not a devouring fire d artagnan who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with impatience was beginning to attack the quick				12482.014276193955
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate				2499.9120969022556
de chevreuse had been in paris but still further that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a cabal when he affirmed that he the cardinal was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about her the queen s emissary to the exiled duchess a musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king louis xiii				1348.315929801195
see what good fortune i brought you said morrel when he was alone with the count				259.59050178380016

her majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor and that in the presence of witnesses				3787.5739420860336
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me				67.87595748622317
oh sir he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are saved the bark is supplied with provisions this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety				40689.24095610529
yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits there are no bandits cried debray				618.0506521438325
imprisonment menaces ill treatment she has suffered everything				389.36923505749024
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain				4718.794409640435
that proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted i listen to you and i wonder at you sir said the queen				415.0331761114315
if a question in heraldry were started athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom their genealogy their alliances their coats of arms and the origin of them				80.13034284746814
did not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours so cruel to me today that you came to england solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for it seasickness tempest captivity				5081.842368627614
i do not know whether you remember that this is the of september it is ten years today since i saved your father s life who wished to die morrel seized the count s hand and kissed it the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him				31.516913244664593
sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded arms begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon				8503.88039121077
well i follow its course i track its passage i adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my way for my friendship for your family and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes well oh speak speak doctor i shall have courage well sir you have in your establishment or in your family perhaps one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only one				1206.5697663915828
do you find me of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me yes monsieur said the englishman bowing				3595.8931576822674
the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray				613.395943912365
let me see said the count are you not the marquis bartolomeo cavalcanti bartolomeo cavalcanti joyfully replied the italian yes i am really he ex major in the austrian service was i a major timidly asked the old soldier				5109.780970984151
then he pointed to the door				175.78546744460638
he will inform against you				63.75678119573973
the friends went to bed early but neither of them slept				12627.883744069934
yes yes and now i believe you are right and that you have really saved my life be assured i will return the favor hereafter villefort shook his head				446.3701789225242
but first write your request to dessessart				35892.85924136914
i will introduce you to them but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said danglars				268.39164639103325
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward				4350.093315464638
she only felt the pulsation in her own fingers and withdrew her hand with a shudder				1307.1442200564973
as she advanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name				515.2094892210524
excellent said aramis				20.018009383907387
nothing nothing only shut the window				524.499761434162
write a second letter for that clever personage who lives at tours aramis resumed his pen reflected a little and wrote the following lines which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends				316.1383105906269
should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession a steel probe to search hearts a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy sir said villefort upon my word you overcome me				78.14643230919559
but athos might be said to bear a charmed life				387.08927739227863
with you d artagnan with you porthos all four reunited for the first time for twenty years we would dare not only england but the three kingdoms put together and did you promise the queen resumed d artagnan petulantly to storm the tower of london to kill a hundred thousand soldiers to fight victoriously against the wishes of the nation and the ambition of a man and when that man is cromwell				1293.2764465107189
i have brought her here sir and i have deposited her in charge of charlotte who till better advice comes has bathed the foot in cold well water the guests now all took leave of athos excepting the old duc de barbe who as an old friend of the family of la valliere went to see little louise and offered to take her to blois in his carriage				550.3531848687211
tell me sir could you have the courage to do so yes morrel said monte cristo with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young man s excitement yes i would do so you exclaimed morrel with increasing anger and reproach you who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when i might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms				590.0290516769132
where is béthune athos why upon the frontiers of artois and of flanders				7210.043109235049

the pope heaped attentions upon rospigliosi and spada conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at rome				875.4752852212513
the porter at the palace was about to close the gates but seeing such a handsome equipage he fancied that it was some visit of importance and the carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch				1626726.3099126436
it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance see that now said porthos and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him				29.78528849469068
but said porthos i think i have an idea in my turn silence for monsieur porthos s idea said aramis				83.15578770994988
bonacieux had named mandé because mandé was in an exactly opposite direction from st				3761.8710702302947
but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust well such things have been that there should be a famine recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans so much the better				1016.7479888863957
i give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter that is true answered the marquis				44250.55766115546
poor fellow				2307.989416235965
the poor child appeared herself to require the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative				2269120.6920903134
we will talk over our travels and you who have seen the whole world will relate your adventures you shall tell us the history of the beautiful greek who was with you the other night at the opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess				5583.239128389617
the road as d artagnan had observed was the way to blois				5966.366726629294
did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death prurigo and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane insane raving mad his head becomes weaker				47976.665648557144
furthermore d artagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow				2751.8184933632224
d artagnan smiled				587.4171900035005
i should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times				1775.9350766495454
it was about half past nine				5161.731906379823
that name written in her hand you see then said athos there is a god in heaven still chapter lxiv				109192.45772151834
you were saying sir said fernand awaiting with great anxiety the end of this interrupted remark				5689.770811825588
bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the louvre				11689.591675251053
dantès reflected as he worked on the shout of joy which with a single word he could evoke from all these men if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart but far from disclosing this precious secret he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual questions his minute observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions				18361.761264072407
we will wait for these gentlemen so please you i have plenty of time and it will be more correct				1588943.2203164652
it remains now for us to keep our word				515.1866423219678
whilst this scene was going on d artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze				4218.491246612445
to eat do you hear are you hungry come you understand me what would your excellency like to eat a piece of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed place bread				23919.697039686984
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his grace s lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written				96126.66717455634
oh my mother exclaimed albert so overcome he could scarcely speak it is not the same with you and me you can not have made the same resolution i have for i have come to warn you that i bid adieu to your house and and to you i also replied mercédès am going and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me have i deceived myself mother said albert with firmness				159740.83239565694
m de tréville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m de tréville hastened to report himself at the louvre				12495.317879070202
is it really your intention to make me captain of the pharaon if i were sole owner we d shake hands on it now my dear dantès and call it settled but i have a partner and you know the italian proverb chi ha compagno ha padrone he who has a partner has a master but the thing is at least half done as you have one out of two votes				2748075.0624501626
truly said monte cristo with your post horses going at the rate of two leagues an hour and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or ill tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses do i not ali the count put his head out of the window and whistled and the horses appeared to fly				5071.757290800429

you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either bertuccio bowed and resumed his story				3937.120580203672
after some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by athos				185.43172733278212
as to the rest of the blade the master had slyly put that on one side to make himself a larding pin				41678.79497193509
ah what else is there said danglars for at present i can not say that i have seen anything extraordinary				60072.608418196716
in this place were together pouches and barrels the pouches contained of money in gold and the barrels were filled with pounds of gunpowder				186185.46809770318
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars to the count andrea cavalcanti				1246.0706469396014

the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning the subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever but remarked madame de villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond ah that is where the art comes in				583.4286900701254
oh woe to me yes you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest search search but what have i done to you exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality what have i done to you				84.81574399750853
the house at auteuil monte cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer				1862.3198279873577
athos you have done wrong but my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the musketeer				1078.0002133388034

it was evident that she was making unnatural efforts to subdue her anger she fanned herself smelled at her vinaigrette and walked up and down				683.9399888831805
indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration				3174.5904847089305
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me the minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look and villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king he had made a friend of one on whom in case of necessity he might rely				2168979.7551813517
but the knife had fortunately we ought to say skillfully come in contact with the steel busk which at that period like a cuirass defended the chests of women				1919.3264114751873

repudiated by her husband said athos				10.453894739116317
as soon as his engagement with the patron of la jeune amélie ended he would hire a small vessel on his own account for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres and under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo				358.7437745298235

i was not willing to fly				6796.321126857261
bonacieux had sunk into an armchair without the power of moving				973419.4951304087
i understand perfectly again danglars bit his lips he saw that he was no match for monte cristo in an argument of this sort and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more congenial				1763707.7871197972

all at once the noise of a door turning on its hinges made me start				19403.54202477105
but do you know where no in the king s room the king s room cried athos				92.66348900124133
the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franz s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened				3835.211368319525
i felt instinctively that someone approached me it is said that the doomed wretch in the deserts of america thus feels the approach of the serpent				27224.954239349474

felton cast his eyes round for means of escape and seeing the door free he rushed into the next chamber in which as we have said the deputies from la rochelle were waiting crossed it as quickly as possible and rushed toward the staircase but upon the first step he met lord de winter who seeing him pale confused livid and stained with blood both on his hands and face seized him by the throat crying i knew it				62.24004553355954
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot				1671.6460893204162

cavalcanti dressed in black like one of goethe s heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking hand through his light hair and so displayed a sparkling diamond that in spite of monte cristo s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger				1064.328591857081
