i wish to see him at once ah said the jailer do not always brood over what is impossible or you will be mad in a fortnight you think so yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before you how long has he left it two years was he liberated then no he was put in a dungeon listen said dantès				435.0389809389499

you will begin therefore by taking me first out of paris will you not my dear m d artagnan a difficult commission my lord replied d artagnan resuming his serious manner				2665.751514540571
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent				38015.66075743456
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy				645.365103047568
he immediately made a new point in advance rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves of trees and placed himself across the road about two hundred paces from the camp				2554.114562574293
and we did not surrender no				317.19560160567374
then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain monte cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spot the appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening				3380.0849724179416
to love you cry fie				1017670.6385637351

women say those things but never do them you do not know mercédès what she threatens she will do idiot muttered danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself that s what i call love said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever				1869.2530674739028
i said i wished to be alone he exclaimed on seeing the young man				226.63024586615154
the officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty five or twenty six years of age				3751.9787365652123
tell me sir could you have the courage to do so yes morrel said monte cristo with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young man s excitement yes i would do so you exclaimed morrel with increasing anger and reproach you who have deceived me with false hopes who have cheered and soothed me with vain promises when i might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my arms				523.0970733342582
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation				1976.4157962757533
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice work slowly said the curate we leave you in an excellent tone of mind yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone another upon the highway or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest aves cœli comederunt illam plague stifle you and your latin said d artagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted				6887.414097424587
well i will live if you promise me still to hope and if you grant me the care of your future prospects you will redouble my strength				2051.3455459606303
but athos was a man of inflexible determination he firmly adhered to a purpose once formed when it seemed to him to spring from conscience and to be prompted by a sense of duty				2576.8325621235226
in consequence of this feeling of repugnance he was about to pass without speaking to him but as he had done the day before m bonacieux accosted him				43.717337827802595
and king charles is well as i have just heard he is dead my lord said aramis				14.353910957689285
i am brother to parry his majesty s lackey athos and aramis remembered that this was the name by which de winter had called the man they had found in the passage of the king s tent				5854.192828785668
the library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall and contained upwards of two thousand volumes one division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding				635430.2997933376
some ham my boy or we can t drink and her brother added d artagnan timidly				3750.5656272680944
signor pastrini had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied				5413.665017350815
eh it was that that did the business after pitching heavily for twelve hours we sprung a leak				676687.537036395
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber				736.1856960766435
she who mistaking you for the cardinal s guards has just fled away your companion cried d artagnan becoming more pale than the white veil of his mistress				1675.8137477059163
the count told everyone that this adventure had happened during his absence at auteuil and that he only knew what was related by the abbé busoni who that evening by mere chance had requested to pass the night in his house to examine some valuable books in his library				12157.837394093583
that s a daring rascal whispered the count				397.9666386649594
these two instantly mounted the coachman of the latter replacing d artagnan on the coach box of the royal coach				1302.4877942780704
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor and i i tell you against both				7049.856888737161
live maximilian and i will be yours				1857.7149136765609
you marry a money bag label it is true well but what does that matter				912.5058845901384
he cried out and staggered against the wall like a drunken man then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé s cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his bed where the turnkey found him in the evening visit sitting with fixed gaze and contracted features dumb and motionless as a statue				4509.172362942643
the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less				6484.321885833487
the abbé told me it was worth francs muttered caderousse				137.40347321004586
do you know them fernand he said				193.18679486554387
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded				4653.205176143791
if only we two arrive said d artagnan it will be enough since the duke s troop are only four in number that is true said porthos and he spurred his courser on				937.149719717317
the matter was all explained to him and the friends gave him to understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for kitty				3010.825917509501
see paragraph c below				3633.21812094195
chapter xli				16546.37792918935
grimaud and his basket were far in advance out of the range of the balls				12386.933779432255
i felt his blood gush over my face but i was intoxicated i was delirious and the blood refreshed instead of burning me				172.16178393178768
the ante rooms were still full of soldiers the passages still lined by guards				1708.699990736261
he would fain have gazed upon his gold and yet he had not strength enough for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the rocks of monte cristo terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea fowls with his wild cries and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of gold and jewels				19708.032003502947
think for a moment				779.945862476053
the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men one is the equality that elevates the other is the equality that degrades one brings a king within reach of the guillotine the other elevates the people to a level with the throne				5531.95535940369
bonacieux and your regiment your captain by my soul you had made me forget all that dear constance				7075.019816147814

monsieur mordaunt				479.65225416155516
but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of maximilian				2481.5401012927578
the guards were unable to help any one each one was occupied with his self preservation				40049.35973384748
escape as lord de winter had thought milady s wound was not dangerous				4983.013615238075
no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes				790298.3908275852
at five o clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had				696238.3530152801
i shall do my duty as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my promise to the dying man				356.6730766690699
lord de winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who a minute before prepared apparently for a fight				4080.249205600328
the means we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that women on the contrary are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from you your misfortunes are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of others crimes in any case sir you will allow replied madame danglars that even if the fault were alone mine i last night received a severe punishment for it poor thing said villefort pressing her hand it was too severe for your strength for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well well i must tell you				84.92776495845456
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies				731444.8471014894
come come cried rochefort				460.7213560461999
i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping chamber which presented an appearance of the wildest disorder				7954.377916714309
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century chapter xi				5113.783325538638

never mind where it comes from said porthos let us taste it and if it is good let us drink it no said athos don t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown source you are right athos said d artagnan				38.193738367022696
d artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described				14406.017873579018
the young man s eyes gradually resumed their dull and glassy appearance and he fell into a profound reverie				4812.910684585266
set out therefore in a week with your suite and go to the hotel de la chevrette rue tiquetonne and there await me that s agreed said porthos				53.10251207634703

order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the holsters				7745.928861153517
you do not understand me gentlemen said d artagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun				2579.3354701838884
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all states of the united states				3114.842500818248
the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville				1955.633139338115
was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up				1085.8154553976265
i will have him come in if you really wish it athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back				1073.0972648924665
many young men of palestrina frascati and pampinara had disappeared				525.350042912468
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh				1444.6844597078393
he felt ill at ease and at a loss what to do				821.2803655541105
at this name every one looked around for his was already a very celebrated name				784.2846541228389
it is almost dinner time and i had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful stepmother my too devoted maid and my troublesome brother who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery which i am in a fair way never to get done				635.9118831200399
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee my word of honor sir said athos				13.927085679891338
milady listened with the greatest attention and yet it was easily to be perceived whatever effort she made to conceal her impressions that this recital was not agreeable to her				133.57178052784877
dantès raised his head and saw faria s eyes injected with blood				1765.296985143377
he entered without knocking or giving any other intimation of his presence as if he had been a friend or the master of the place				675.1993446751932
milady oh yes said porthos true i had forgotten it athos looked at him intently				780162.7893340973
what no wine				2247.4900769734354
morrel said he it is a happy day for me to feel that i am beloved by such a man as you				162.48035438820233
i speak of that spiteful and intriguing italian of the pedant who has tried to put on his own head a crown which he stole from under a pillow of the scoundrel who calls his party the party of the king who wants to send the princes of the blood to prison not daring to kill them as our great cardinal our cardinal did of the miser who weighs his gold pieces and keeps the clipped ones for fear though he is rich of losing them at play next morning of the impudent fellow who insults the queen as they say so much the worse for her and who is going in three months to make war upon us in order that he may retain his pensions is that the master whom you propose to me				107.06970102932034
but she waited in vain				1559.3510686170216
bonacieux dead and to d artagnan whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life				572.8760547631811

will your excellency give your name or remain incognito asked the captain				571.2984969038962
he had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach house ready for him				52.57232879558245
you great people always lose something by scandal notwithstanding your millions				3503.8253344254003
m noirtier has evinced you say a kind feeling towards me				90.4391542339498
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks				50376.59452774677
the people have seen monsieur de condé a prince of the blood royal arrested by my mother in law maria de medicis they saw my mother in law their former regent expelled by the cardinal they saw monsieur de vendome that is to say the son of henry iv a prisoner at vincennes and whilst these great personages were imprisoned insulted and threatened they said nothing and now for a broussel good god				555.7802922431513
the unfortunate woman was exhausted not by fatigue but by terror and when d artagnan placed his hand upon her shoulder she sank upon one knee crying in a choking voice kill me if you please you shall know nothing d artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist but as he felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting he made haste to reassure her by protestations of devotedness				653464.3503389616
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted				785402.5918756104
what the devil are you doing here count accomplishing my destiny replied rochefort falling on one knee				5405.993265770234
come my friend come let me embrace you				83.49514404671902
madame bonacieux is lost so much the worse for her if she is found no athos no you are mistaken said d artagnan i love my poor constance more than ever and if i knew the place in which she is were it at the end of the world i would go to free her from the hands of her enemies but i am ignorant				4884.122174436908
he shrugged his shoulders when people spoke of the future				1916.2336787086322
hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly d artagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos				318.8640338555804
a boat was fastened to the shore by a chain fixed to a stake				516408.57811543334
he then began to ascend the path				9353.153674578285
yes sire and yours monsieur d herblay yes sire as you wish then				344.16516521426036
that is to say cried bonacieux who saw he had taken a false step that is to say you have answered that you should recognize him said the commissary				18111.61802726332
move on then and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded				6604.669821701061
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the world you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best friends who will soon spread the report				3715.8603715386366
the shutter where eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to bed				817.1661947869011
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornélie				134378.7144971455

oh your great work on the monarchy of italy faria then drew forth from his hiding place three or four rolls of linen laid one over the other like folds of papyrus				688589.7416065786
she appeared much dejected and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes				642.2929438464809
make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your business the young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them				102.19683135273593
i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek one is i believe from phædrus and the other from bias				483460.13343132695
i will go straight to the louvre i will give in my resignation as captain of the king s musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal s guards and if he refuses me morbleu i will turn abbé at these words the murmur without became an explosion nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies				493578.3991828382
you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and i think you relished them tolerably while speaking caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions				587337.9827296669
grimaud made a sign in the affirmative				4421.497433751053
wait an instant my friend and you shall be satisfied				5400.654746468843
let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear buckingham				886.7066532554727
well well my dear edmond continued the owner don t let me detain you				67.05255808250361
bazin was their only attendant for grimaud had stayed behind to take care of mousqueton				2134.209486188182
i my lord said d artagnan why should i because you shrug your shoulders it is a way i have of speaking to myself				597.4255200578795
with his elbows on the table he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the light of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages like black fantastic dust				3992.0755958837426
porthos agreed to the bargain the thing suited him wonderfully well				475.8889353138036
at four o clock as we have already stated the mysterious personage arrived				1917.1677398000984
no one could be seen or heard				988.0194285319507
were consumed or nearly so he commenced complaints which athos thought nauseous porthos indecent and aramis ridiculous				9485.307612884375
a similar signal replied to him and five minutes after a boat appeared rowed by four men				369.90462461948147
now is my time to make peace with this gallant man said d artagnan to himself having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of the conversation and with this good feeling drawing near to aramis who was departing without paying any attention to him monsieur said he you will excuse me i hope ah monsieur interrupted aramis permit me to observe to you that you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought what monsieur cried d artagnan and do you suppose i suppose monsieur that you are not a fool and that you knew very well although coming from gascony that people do not tread upon handkerchiefs without a reason				3936.6475125488273
this count of monte cristo is a strange man said emmanuel				2732.758626867381
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell				2547.1965519028035
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding night and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the sum required and finally of his application to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed				5807.56056621136
madame he said to the duchess i have had the boldness to present myself at your hotel without being known to you it has succeeded since you deign to receive me				60.04141651274734
what reason do you assign my reason replied the young girl				728.92848171927
so d artagnan began sir he said with desperate politeness it seems to me that you change your costume almost as rapidly as i have seen the italian mummers do whom the cardinal mazarin brought over from bergamo and whom he doubtless took you to see during your travels in france mordaunt did not reply				1218.3162800711175
midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl				1337.3359669440495
but what have you done asked franz				134.24190332918485
noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room				192.6825518051373
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth				757115.0829965596
porthos bowed				870.5722325074389
much money to be gained said bonacieux protruding his lip				722990.8241409484
the young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had spoken				3171.7398364199935
you forget my dear you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself				1564.6265833806829
and yet the two young people had never declared their affection they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens				2515.9007306218123
to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when d artagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure				7075.458401946021
fire cried grimaud unconsciously				1353757.817099286
he then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the servant did not find him				43.697642747225316
i am sure you would not have forced me to come				1359.1851127814407
you are irritated and vexed tell me how this fernand is related to you he is merely my father said albert m				285.40567538767147
monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter				29868.443487459634
was mazarin to remain the favorite and minister of the queen				426.37197954394935
and as the man approached d artagnan in order to have more freedom for his actions leaned half out of the door his eyes were fixed upon those of the mendicant which were lighted up by a lantern				16465.185292815702
besides we are sent here by cardinal mazarin and at this moment represent both the king and the cardinal and are therefore as ambassadors able to act with impunity a thing that general oliver cromwell who is assuredly as great a politician as he is a general is quite the man to understand				1380.086301868516

at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village curé				584331.0909493915

the abbé was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding				791707.5334576919
soon strange fact aramis undid two buttons of his doublet seeing which porthos unfastened his entirely				16020.423310746535
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows they ascended five or six more steps and then dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro				772816.1643560444

they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette				18425.805869285414
dantès thought as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land				3683.1899875824965
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city				1421.8730618591173
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after you how so i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majesty s ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor d artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues				6129.579699722658
he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady her first attempts after her arrival				15313.78897418668

mercédès was much changed within the last few days not that even in her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery no the change in mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled her lips no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit				9639.385055093844
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for olivain				22021.991955300324
since you appear to know so many things can you tell me what is become of that woman i presume that she has returned to tours to tours				7520.775794654934

but he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened				3130.6202753414605
as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it				65.67257532285731
he therefore went down the rue des petits augustins and came up to the quay in order to take the new bridge				7637.069196636959

dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his desire to be quite alone				927.861433536442
philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoled you the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously				5569.221131714275

at length the reading of the indictment was ended				7019.720568011707
i asked the price they told me it was francs				1313.2417563746164
with a man like you i fear nothing athos bowed				767.5969344990091
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses				1052.1113859604664
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched arms towards the table				552.8867132009987
my sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance				16757.075256521337

this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible upon my word said dantès you make me shudder				3719.480272336294
he however darted not the less quickly toward milady yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over iron				8083.641206683482
sir he said you are a profound thinker and your plan was sublime say absurd since it has become useless				1583.3092172185006
the first carriage which arrived after that of the queen was that of the prince de condé with the princess and dowager princess				5182.690516309416

but all three reflected upon the youth of d artagnan and dreaded his inexperience				750724.7022455845
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara				723079.0852437065
athos repeated to him the same question he had asked the first person he met				44132.427282777586
do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said d artagnan to the youth				4393.947576373131

i knew a lord wilmore who was constantly doing actions of this kind without revealing himself he was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude oh heaven exclaimed julie clasping her hands in what did he believe then he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said monte cristo touched to the heart by the accents of julie s voice but perhaps since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist and do you know this gentleman monsieur inquired emmanuel				1612.8459026562357
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold				2425.721481688195
it appears sir that this edmond dantès had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners held communication with one another this tunnel was dug no doubt with an intention of escape no doubt but unfortunately for the prisoners the abbé faria had an attack of catalepsy and died that must have cut short the projects of escape for the dead man yes replied m de boville but not for the survivor on the contrary this dantès saw a means of accelerating his escape				1941.3786436864743

bravo d artagnan				1.2270635440234323
all the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman and her looks fixed on the future beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for her by the cardinal whom she had so successfully served without his name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair				1102.387724170831
madame danglars and eugénie were going out at that moment they heard the cause of the disturbance				5472.367940842469
i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will please m villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king s attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it still said château renaud dr				867742.0637499449
the harlequin had reassumed her peasant s costume and as she passed she raised her mask				4863.712266865449
the young man went to her and took her hands then she sobbed aloud				2249.8297144674398
to lift their hands against a minister of god come here sir said urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other the wounded man smiled sadly				2989.9977562147164

yes albert from whatever source the blow may have proceeded it may be from an enemy but that enemy is only the agent of providence albert held his head between his hands he raised his face red with shame and bathed in tears and seizing beauchamp s arm my friend said he my life is ended				7372.645553388988
a nice acquaintance my friend porthos replied aramis i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is injurious to you among the women gentlemen gentlemen cried d artagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is serious				58375.04158077203
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner				48043.42154635312
and according to his custom d artagnan glanced rapidly around and remarked that mazarin had a sealed letter before him				56.434064036007825
oh look at me continued she with a feeling of profound melancholy my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the time has long fled since i used to smile on edmond dantès who anxiously looked out for me from the window of yonder garret then inhabited by his old father				688.5624234450402

come he said it is only a veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of cavalcanti				2073.611006297573
now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your work look said faria showing to the young man a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush to the end of which was tied by a piece of thread one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to dantès it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen				8995.380423764234
count she said you are i fear gained over to the court				1369.7238452030972
general d épinay died five minutes after franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud but after a moment s silence he continued the president went up the steps after pushing his sword into his cane a track of blood on the snow marked his course				2375.684229205225

my lackey and i will have three shots at you and you will get as many from the cellar				2130.773546744943

ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by ali and were received by the abbé busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse				2266.350080545716
what an appetite you used to have				6038.291280967118
what then to do				654.6172742482539
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerf s face				649.7559509275272
you know well that i don t like to leave things half finished conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis				261.081019848948

he questioned them as to the news they had each been charged to obtain but nothing positive had been learned				37449.41844404867
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its truth he cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in letters of blood upon the wall but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them				101.8769737324866
then he looked anxiously at valentine				440.2065434988685
she arose came to the table ate but little and drank only water				1486.531226970857
presently the door opened and she perceived felton				596.8748263775194

these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot				608639.9302678182
if you prefer any other place said athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves this place if monsieur d herblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer				1121.5550377934694
one thing alone however threw a shade over the pallid brow of felton				2696.702587651059
if i am not saved i shall be avenged you are not a woman said athos coldly and sternly				47135.075474878984
the english do they dislike wine they hate it but i have seen them drink it as a punishment				2110.754808983373
i don t know what it was				1277.4915328538373
not so bad yet replied athos for by this time she must have quit the shores of france d artagnan breathed again				574.5579593811282
general said the president do not alarm yourself you are among men of honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in possession of our secret and you must restore it to us a significant silence followed these words and as the general did not reply close the doors said the president to the door keeper				5311.59880874436

at the moment when he opened the door such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished				27692.95518424181
he had assumed the entire costume of cucumetto				5018.495504808318
i am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the puritans				5834.640412572518
fortunately the reader may remember or may not remember fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him				86.11008085938253

in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding m de villefort s house and behind the gate half screened from view by the large chestnut trees which on all sides spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some people of our acquaintance				5228.975824120882
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood and he said nothing as he died yes he exclaimed oh i suppose answered d artagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much well sir cried the queen				228.2112249983918

forsooth i don t know half a pistole if you can find out said d artagnan				1.8376810432001718
anne of austria took one step backward became so pale that it might be said she was dying and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind her to keep herself from falling she with her right hand drew the paper from her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals				14536.573530786556
i thought she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory				2563.10380755227
yes yes he murmured i am in the hands of the brigands of whom albert de morcerf spoke his first idea was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded				4246.244750484671
on the contrary be off and quickly				2751.713521820587
aramis made a bound seized the letter read it or rather devoured it his countenance radiant				35139.29672067557
i have had the honor of informing your eminence that these men were drunk and was this lady young and handsome asked the cardinal with a certain degree of anxiety				1761.291395700768
the others attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different parts of the house for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room and that at the same time they would obtain a view of the rest of the building of which monte cristo had created a palace				2457.249665360582
my daughter continued danglars when a father asks his daughter to choose a husband he has always some reason for wishing her to marry				21740.07753977793
you at last cried d artagnan				1.1729445401546348
yes continued he a charming woman who entertained kind views toward our friend d artagnan who on his part has given her some offense for which she tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots a week ago by trying to poison him and yesterday by demanding his head of the cardinal what				693.2445268932225
but unfortunately i must wait you must wait for what asked caderousse				58.54672611491833

porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the king				702.7295938395339
the insult at the banker s door beauchamp stopped morcerf				632.8874405399444
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work				862.4466176363313
he found his carriage at the door and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp who was in his office				4210.2921686516165
go to england join the king be his friends protectors march to battle at his side and be near him in his house where conspiracies more dangerous than the perils of war are hatching every day				517.0678948363653

porthos gained fifty pistoles from groslow and found him a more agreeable companion than he had at first believed him to be				1154.9206272128386
athos killed his adversary first				2063.4397879419294
owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that moment we will not say all powerful because morrel was a prudent and rather a timid man so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of bonaparte accused him of moderation but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of dantès				954.0261391074623
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said				248.68325998017315

faria saw this				758.1739014457739
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the stone				3460.6175915868057
she had forced us to accept a little souvenir a magnificent spanish genet and an andalusian mule which were beautiful to look upon				4818.867532135822
this amused him sometimes a little and made him endure the siege with patience but it did not prevent his getting very tired or from talking at every moment of returning to paris so that if the messengers and the spies had failed his eminence notwithstanding all his inventiveness would have found himself much embarrassed				6368.911683572175
instead of returning the ball to me when i call for it from the top of the wall he throws me another that other ball contains a letter				753.1358653650811
he continued to follow the path to the glade but to his great surprise carlini arrived almost as soon as himself				206.64379489147385
an idiot who held the life of lord de winter in his hands and did not kill him by which i missed three hundred thousand livres income that s true said kitty your son was the only heir of his uncle and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune d artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature reproach him with that sharp voice which she took such pains to conceal in conversation for not having killed a man whom he had seen load her with kindnesses				864890.0812695031
in gold silver or notes half in gold and the other half in bank notes if you please said the count rising from his seat				3587.4669407284578
d artagnan tell us what sort of a night you have had and we will describe ours afterward ah yes said a light horseman with a glass of brandy in his hand which he sipped slowly				7402.962551131925
i will enter a cloister i will become a nun said milady				51.64434797226762
i had designedly taken this direction				5361.289689674189
no but it will be said caderousse as surely as dantès will be captain of the pharaon eh danglars danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness				576952.5621430188
i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m de saint méran i applied my smelling salts but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied				5026.667083976773
good thought milady she takes a pleasure in my conversation				996.4425577506788
our purveyor yes your purveyor godeau the purveyor of the musketeers my faith				1860.2030962918209
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy				11261.353289925304
his next act was to purchase a dog from one of his keepers				729739.2115772151
his hand of iron grasped quick as lightning firm as a pair of blacksmith s pincers the soldier s throat				1958.9295699786073
poisons act particularly on some organ or another one on the stomach another on the brain another on the intestines				681507.2368386239
ah said porthos opening his eyes at that last word				626.7011184039641
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem				5289.276442069461
at last he uttered a sigh of satisfaction and paused as if he had partially appeased his hunger				2316.1146288428663
the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d artagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m de tréville s private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl				729172.9414961891
is the spot far from here a hundred leagues it is not ill planned said the governor				837.3201459755924
until this day and for how long a time he had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness				4221.5418336925795
the guards asked permission of la ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone				778.6044324854051
but let us make haste sir with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost oh this time doctor you shall not have to reproach me with weakness				2578.6136064162174
count returned signor pastrini hurt at albert s repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions i do not say this to you but to your companion who knows rome and knows too that these things are not to be laughed at my dear fellow said albert turning to franz here is an admirable adventure we will fill our carriage with pistols blunderbusses and double barrelled guns				12530.891399546439

yes if it is not any serious affair otherwise i can not answer as to what i may do myself be prudent in any event said the countess				2147.2120199763763
if you were a duchess a marchioness or a countess it would be quite a different thing it would be unpardonable the procurator s wife was piqued				11774.108211193996
aramis made a presence of believing in the reality of her opposition and was unwilling to deprive himself in his own view of the credit of her conversion				55268.694786394
my good charles i particularly recommend to your care planchet the laquais of monsieur d artagnan				7.0875590632924785
the two witnesses followed				5923.652122898157

has your uneasiness anything to do with what m de blacas has told me and m de villefort has just confirmed m de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect				706269.7012754994

well said morcerf i may as well be magnanimous and tear myself away to forward your wishes				4335.597518453183
you have mistaken the time you should have told me this two months ago it is too late now				1514.6719772844738
madame de villefort closed the door carefully after the child the count appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber the young wife returned to her chair in which she seated herself				1682.7770636332991
porthos did the same				1271.690356037409
lovely as the greek girls of cyprus or chios mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet and ripe round coral lips				474.0019760797959
he was dressed in violet tinted velvet trimmed with silk of the same color				4974.476531184763
a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance which was not natural to him				51.65635451548337
gondy related to them the insults he had received at the palais royal and retailed the jests of beautin the count de villeroy and marechal de la meilleraie				694111.545328019

rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him				51.187720439855454
the carriage stopped the officer descended approached the guardhouse a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order dantès saw the reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay				3398.8849391959557
at this moment one of his penitents passed and as she was young and pretty aramis took off his cap to her with his most gracious smile				415.36875770046
did this proposed breakfast cover some stratagem				627332.9338386024
we can not say how long the night seemed to milady but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness				32139.12941649656
you see i give you a wide range				726447.2383687038

they spurred on their horses the other cavaliers were only twenty steps from them				120.6085966163897
porthos he exclaimed				3205.4721326981594
monsieur groslow is perhaps rather hasty it s true but at bottom i have discovered two good qualities in him he is conceited and stupid porthos opened his eyes in amazement athos and aramis looked at one another and smiled they knew d artagnan and knew that he did nothing without a purpose				2065.793693663845
but athos might be said to bear a charmed life				654.8995149153761

it seemed however even in the very face of open day that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed so deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination				2771.4605801924804

danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way				703.213626930741
fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me				50.96637859168351
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried athos				11.00705776585236

here you decide then nothing about me my lord on the contrary i have come to a decision bernouin came into the room				218.0582626927336

by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide				11743.717818382675
for my part observed aramis i can not say the same as you do porthos				138.43974553324333
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her grandfather				8537.367182277354
the discourse being finished the queen remained silent				1366.5956393762021

the box taken by albert was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this reason generally styled the nobility s boxes and although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for one admitting merely four occupants				602749.8259745281

in the morning it was rumored that prince de condé had evacuated bethune and fallen back on carvin leaving however a strong garrison in the former city				1437.9395931395645
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it				74.65935461757155
but he went on with his peculiar smile i am here in paris and have plenty of time before me by and by will do for that with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home				2271.7675095112354

d artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck				1759.1494041301737
but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of d artagnan who is a faithful friend whom i love and defend or i swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit or shall have committed shall be the last monsieur d artagnan has cruelly insulted me said milady in a hollow tone monsieur d artagnan shall die indeed				1057.568782173587
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his dinner but dantès feared lest the report of his gun should attract attention				699.7873349206509
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess s box				2160.552343531387

no no like shakespeare s polonius he died for another				891.8311195568812
a light cloud passed over the count s face				680.8234571381425
the body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers and how far back into the past do your recollections extend i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners and how old were you at that time i was three years old said haydée				2235.1844869925453

oh look at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me the count looked up and fixed his eyes on mercédès who arose partly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him				47.0760641147152
mazarin had left his lamp in the gallery to make people believe that he was walking about but he had with him a waxlight to help him to explore his mysterious strong box				2205.3274640354216
but putting his head out of the carriage eh				5823.794465361762

athos is near you said d artagnan warn him as i have warned you aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution				519213.4863637446
the house with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old dantès formerly inhabited the only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret while the whole house was now placed at the command of mercédès by the count				424.37933294268527
do not bring on me the horrors of remorse				7936.934361753783

and you my lord if i wish to leave that would be much more difficult why so your eminence might be recognized even under this disguise asked mazarin raising a cloak which covered an arm chair upon which lay a complete dress for an officer of pearl gray and red entirely embroidered with silver				4316.993967117672
the report of firearms was heard near the rue saint denis and occasionally church bells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the populace				651303.5842646168
the messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands				578.9386526252362
show him a white handkerchief knotted at the four corners and tell the crew to disembark and carry the powder back to the arsenal unless indeed unless said mordaunt whose face was lighted by a savage joy as cromwell spoke this skiff might be of use to you for personal projects oh my lord my lord that title said cromwell laughing is all very well here but take care a word like that does not escape your lips in public but your honor will soon be called so generally i hope so at least said cromwell rising and putting on his cloak				1542.8127281753436
i did not observe it yesterday it must be the fog rising from the river said the king				286.499223136296

if he send me his poniard it will signify that the emperor s intentions are not favorable and i am to set fire to the powder if on the contrary he send me his ring it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched my friend said my mother when your master s orders arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible death which we both so much dread you will mercifully kill us with this same poniard will you not yes vasiliki replied selim tranquilly				574840.821745202
it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp				6337.7200442706635
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her				176.6527167324573
this time you shall not escape me neither is it my intention monsieur for this time i was seeking you in the name of the king i arrest you how				1785.1912755471465
baptistin left the room without waiting to answer and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his master had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the ground like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales				688132.1805216444
oh m de villefort i beseech your indulgence for him villefort as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles morrel to the plebeian the first was a royalist the other suspected of bonapartism				40651.54066824946
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all				351.7060810486239
the two notaries were holding a consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair				1069.9034364370443
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens				699815.7658175472
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the case it was the honor of m de morcerf and that of the whole house he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal questions which are always such painful themes of discussion				30282.43545246639
i have that honor your excellency you had a new livery yesterday yes sir i have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening and do not wish to be known lend me your livery till tomorrow				1921.663439236983
and then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own country and considering also that pardon for the only crime of which i was really guilty might come with a double power from lips so benevolent and kind i besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which i recounted the auteuil affair in all its details as well as every other transaction of my life				562.3442572073678
you seek me sir said he				5.998685634371397
sir replied olivain respectfully allow me to remark that we have already much fatigued the horses this morning				528.468043967121
villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy				798931.2059466175
indeed you only wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration				2576.3398886915347
no but i know a little about wounds and mine i know is mortal				30687.880308115895
the prisoner followed his guide who led him into a room almost under ground whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with tears a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly and showed dantès the features of his conductor an under jailer ill clothed and of sullen appearance				1855.8343685369653
i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible yes said porthos				18.63550915903035
hurry the horses bounded beneath the whip and in five minutes they stopped before the count s door				230.52473385928656
then commencing a loud whistling noise he rubbed them well all over their bodies for several minutes then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage ali quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the count s chariot took the reins in his hands and mounted the box when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours returning to her residence in the faubourg saint honoré				10871.474601042783
yes my dear father and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i will ask your consent to go and pay a visit to the catalans go my dear boy said old dantès and heaven bless you in your wife as it has blessed me in my son his wife said caderousse why how fast you go on father dantès she is not his wife yet as it seems to me no but according to all probability she soon will be replied edmond				1072.6869658459311

do you know monsieur de rochefort one of my bitterest enemies the faithful friend of cardinal richelieu i know that and we sent him to the bastile said mazarin				94.92551008920614
appeared walking fast				75281.9951418806
with a word d artagnan reassured them and planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer as his master had come out safe from the palais cardinal				309.85131935518024
gentlemen said d artagnan it is half past four and we have scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six besides if we go out too late nobody will see us said porthos and that will be a pity				2165.2831879509163
hush we are flying i did not understand				933.7026803546107
but this is droll cried d artagnan consoled and holding his sides with laughter				2075.535065338326
now we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker or our readers must have already perceived that d artagnan was not an ordinary man therefore while repeating to himself that his death was inevitable he did not make up his mind to die quietly as one less courageous and less restrained might have done in his place				687.4037302968425
perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so often thought of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the distance that separated them				115.96724950229562
he was not rich although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb and i heard the phrase very often as rich as a spada but he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth his palace was my paradise				15875.02689130921
farewell my son said the curate till tomorrow till tomorrow rash youth said the jesuit				9452.446657348812

in the street of saint thomas du louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by the name of quinze vingts				519990.4789298252
and why presently				69112.42722459626
the doctors are embalming the corpse and when it is ready it will be placed in a lighted chapel mockery muttered athos savagely royal honors to one whom they have murdered well cheer up said a loud voice from the staircase which porthos had just mounted				25781.083814887606
you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and sisteron advancing he is advancing said louis xviii				2371.9364396388696
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat				2784.5003548539926
that was your fault all my oil is lost oil is a sovereign balm for wounds and my poor grimaud here was obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him all my sausages are gnawed there is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar you shall pay me for all this cried the exasperated host				730.5806620224729
if i stay in paris i can not go to rome if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur d artagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneur s resignation i am to remain minister then said mazarin				637.1271614561082
my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of wine				1410.577904489667
whilst these projects were being formed by the duc de beaufort and grimaud the comte de la fere and the vicomte de bragelonne were entering paris by the rue du faubourg saint marcel				721936.6618001828
but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france he is speculating in railways said lord wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect				817623.8564976717
two aces the englishman looked and was seized with astonishment				1182.034257107608
alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful crime				3929.157350860791
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet d artagnan				4.2700476631548545
ah said he between his teeth is there truth in the proverb that fortune comes while one sleeps follow me monsieur said mazarin				72.42290946225582
enough enough replied caderousse say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon myself and he began his story				2632.4693094242543

the departure for belgium a few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of m danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests				2671.354176561717

he is a worthy honest man who entertains neither love nor hatred for anybody				37551.34335914797
you shall want for nothing and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be your own fault at these words he retired				1415.6241301674643
but at the first words he uttered the comte roused himself from the kind of lethargy in which he had sunk				48114.537501367886
wilt thou allow the frightful projects of this man to be accomplished then only she pretended to hear the sound of felton s steps and rising quick as thought she blushed as if ashamed of being surprised on her knees				2825.818200906251

why did he kill himself instead of you				194.72741781029856
danglars too had recognized the bandit whose existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which albert had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers				7602.305363860023
i have seen russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison certainly it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed yes i understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it oh very easily				25928.062857508987

your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and aramis yes your eminence said athos while the two musketeers who had remained behind advanced hat in hand				204.52401199486923
he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head				366.2422648081923

at last it became so narrow that the fugitive tried in vain to proceed				8427.48939340279
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m de saint méran s and he arranged mentally while dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence				29135.22319481375
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile				406.4930895081956
my mother was a christian and she prayed				36661.28826560883
but then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure without arms to defend himself				193.3749005340974

bonacieux to leave the convent and to retire either into lorraine or belgium				763473.2110867826

the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said s accommodi the italian s accommodi is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master it is like that turkish phrase of molière s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance				52934.52373268073

porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself				184.5621211615723
and you porthos i agree to it too said porthos if d artagnan approves of it				121.12054729400013
everything conspired to prove to d artagnan that his presentiments had not deceived him and that a great misfortune had happened				3786.923817730041
the handkerchief you saw had not been given to me but it had been forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends				514.8303127516292

in this case he was not the judge but the executioner				1582.9778153930151
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but one evening about five o clock our little cabin boy came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom house officers advancing in our direction				4178.583308631281

oh i would fight for such a cause but in return for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists say our masters in everything those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities but said franz to the count with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power of the law				1711.440633803302
the troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank the figures were defined like black shadows on the red tinted horizon				2650.8891085429805

never had the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle				4778.435711967213
they advanced silently the count guiding franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark				2758.5147544684523
one was the notary s the other that of franz and his friends				510.2770840846948

what can have become of her then we shall know be assured				8163.211064027467
well said he was i mistaken she has answered you cried franz				141.80177098018268

there is constancy then turning to grimaud he said and thou my brave fellow thou consentest thus to aid me grimaud signified his assent				2228.0293965547207
faithful to his mission of vengeance athos had requested to be conducted to the garden and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest				10037.187257073234
scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows				1810.0221129380275
a cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal				455.7221904252986

this affair would give a fine opportunity for a traitor my lord the chance of being attacked would be an excuse for everything mazarin shuddered but he reflected that a man who had the least intention to betray would not warn first				1724.8891260969401
we are mistaken said d artagnan				1.1234140354066702

my children two of them at least the duke of york and the princess elizabeth are far away from me exposed to the blows of the ambitious and our foes my husband the king is leading in england so wretched an existence that it is no exaggeration to aver that he seeks death as a thing to be desired				4034.236124401517

d artagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung				23113.673006924473

arrived at the bank of the river the three men perceived that they were followed turned around and looking insolently at the frenchmen passed some jests from one to another				954.9391354111891
then compelled to quit rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish scarcely noticed in history				3576.521905554686
he therefore looked forward to six o clock with as much impatience as the duke himself				276.89625945816
he heard the door of the staircase creak on its hinges the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the door of his study opened				1607.4568598043616

the star of day pale but nevertheless still splendid was setting in the horizon glorifying at once the heavens and the sea with bands of fire and casting upon the towers and the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration				706912.5615859464

the host clasped his hands and looked around him suspiciously whilst grimaud knit his brows and approached the wounded man whose worn hard features awoke in his mind such awful recollections of the past				3049.8251686475874
have you not seen m de saint méran madame de saint méran barrois all fall				2123.921292166308

see what good fortune i brought you said morrel when he was alone with the count				501.03704972437373
when this formality was ended as her duties called her to chapel she left the two young women alone				1086.5747527483798
cap de diou				32917.795408128964

madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity				804228.0322810155
but devil take him				47.24758379227001
d artagnan looked much disconcerted				914750.0132919177
the king s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity he looked upon her less severely and bowing to her said slowly farewell madame farewell that farewell struck madame de villefort like the executioner s knife				4734.223740653905
a loud cry could be heard by her				162.61242828441894
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows				1804.308029455589
d artagnan going to a distance to discover aramis				48.829272667136635

danglars acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions and who is rendered brave by fear				2304.2726035651804
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look				1440.99815584342
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity				2542.728325807233
albert she said in a voice which was altered by emotion i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances				23461.47797322039

but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said porthos				16.52171504637886

now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression				9360.899320612649

above you there is the king above the king there is god however perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him				47.521702639295356
villefort s brow darkened more and more his white lips and clenched teeth filled dantès with apprehension				32160.622433868866
this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party				4548.184604080421
in fact the count s face brightened				5964.739616914262
poor queen murmured athos				28.164787806511107
as a skillful general seeing the enemy ready to surrender marches toward him with a cry of victory she rose beautiful as an antique priestess inspired like a christian virgin her arms extended her throat uncovered her hair disheveled holding with one hand her robe modestly drawn over her breast her look illumined by that fire which had already created such disorder in the veins of the young puritan and went toward him crying out with a vehement air and in her melodious voice to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible energy let this victim to baal be sent to the lions the martyr be thrown				682344.8686798253
think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their daughters and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said come despatch the dying shall you go then albert asked franz				276.9004845920104

draw up this note for us aramis but by our holy father the pope cut it short for i shall prune you in my turn i warn you i ask no better said aramis with that ingenious air of confidence which every poet has in himself but let me be properly acquainted with the subject				1928.9822483782402
and be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to england or the continent milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes				617.4830077396409
good said caderousse				48.10523048105571
she turned upon him no longer like a furious woman but like a wounded panther				41135.08240672372
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind				677.5117495695802
really yes said the coadjutor i have heard this affair mentioned				53897.70092321025
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers				5283.826420715552
i swallow every morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather				9156.882372273572
he has been beaten				9145.388647562906

ten leagues of wood of marsh land and valleys he is lord of the hill and the plain and is now carrying on a suit for his feudal rights against the bishop of noyon good said d artagnan to himself				197.41759083269838
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection				4461.6526965252015
shall you never leave me again				218.6294342958252
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three o clock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight				10199.431682044165
what is he waiting for asked another				5680.797553455201
my son i bless thee the young man cast himself on his knees leaning his head against the old man s bed				611.1581003273164
i know nothing can you not understand that monsieur d artagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence truly do you not perceive that i know all your abduction from the little house at st germain his despair that of his friends and their useless inquiries up to this moment				822.3391966361417
i went out as if to fetch wood passed through the subterranean passage into the cellar and whilst parry was gently bolting the door pushed up the board and beckoned to the king to follow me				97.32819882161051
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st peter s franz silently assented and the following afternoon at half past five o clock the young men parted				32894.13370291561
well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those				572796.3500340076
then my son return to the world still more brilliant because of your former sorrows and if i am wrong still let me cherish these hopes for i have no future to look forward to				1998.9113959648282

and why have you such an air of sadness aboard a great misfortune m morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially				814570.6245524158
but what is going on in this accursed paris what is going on my lord				484.95416178857226
the guards more skillful did greater execution but the bourgeois more numerous overwhelmed them with a veritable hurricane of iron				6752.827590925037
the corvette must now i think be on her way to fécamp must she not certainly your excellency i saw her put to sea the same evening we quitted marseilles and the yacht was ordered to remain at martigues tis well				652.4601626501882
noirtier regarded the lovers with a look of ineffable tenderness while barrois who had remained in the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead				1484.2873382529942
you have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel if i had missed you tonight i might not have had another chance you see i do not conceal myself you are lucky i wish i could say as much for i do conceal myself and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added caderousse with his unpleasant smile				383.2300946666194
the counter was covered with a plate of pewter upon this plate was written with the point of a large pin rueil d they went to rueil cried aramis				55.69175630346773
here are two other cavaliers as he spoke two horsemen advanced at full speed				1903.680105565882
perhaps too the natural and instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own				811.2060500129573
we still remain four friends devoted to each other but when it becomes a question of serving the cardinal or of fighting him of being mazarinists or frondists then we are only two is monsieur aramis with d artagnan asked lord de winter				735.418019571134

she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the day when the agent of thomson french had come to her father s related the scene on the staircase repeated the promise she had made and showed him the letter				733.9263617832161
from the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple elegance				7835.509076304206
villefort took a chair but valentine remained standing by her father s side and franz before him holding the mysterious paper in his hand				200.6169410002684
however fugitive this homicide flash felton saw it and started as if its light had revealed the abysses of this woman s heart				180.50824629151387
some wine said athos on perceiving the host				1752.7808356802343
m morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted				30093.978572536667
you must depart instantly monsieur				553.4852291150166
i heard the noise he made in loading his pistols and his servant in loading his musketoon				18048.52777951287
pardon for whom cried he				7.660342970548964
maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room				263.04691023950977
richelieu was a gentleman our equal in birth our superior in position				4036.552892501647
they have killed them i think and taken flight carrying off their booty				601973.1606435186
madame de villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its head				375.6058152582159
you are still with us i presume more than ever				1307.050729159744
well continued valentine the reason of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful marriage which drives me to despair noirtier s breathing came thick and short				7204.832959668201
then he is here he is said monte cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation				9589.917083204526
none of this had escaped the count and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an observer				591492.5219272523
yes your excellency he came from marseilles where he had been deputy procureur				6955.646902053515
about what time why about fifteen or eighteen days ago exactly so and yesterday evening he came again yesterday evening yes just before you came my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies				52038.70867775205
keep the francs you have left i give them to you				94.76744412128367
the general was pacing the room the third time when in turning he perceived monte cristo at the door				196.14709462400415
at last the heavy machine which was called a chariot in those days came out rumbling against the gates and de winter still on horseback bent again to the door to converse with her majesty				3408.9547401852437
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you d artagnan placed his hand upon the queen s diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late				3970.3921219498734
morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear valentine say here i am maximilian come and help me he had arranged everything for her escape two ladders were hidden in the clover field a cabriolet was ordered for maximilian alone without a servant without lights at the turning of the first street they would light the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions				21079.808116127664
the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nîmes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the child he might become acquainted with your person nay he might even then have known it				81.2421527184823
the sergeant answered that puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket				795.211359776719
the servant entered just as he had finished				99539.35878847717
excellent said aramis				10.489081749033003
he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner				41834.89872503487
athos rose and offering him his hand be welcome my lord said he you are one of us i set out five hours after her from portsmouth said lord de winter				587.5160744528332
suddenly an idea flashed across his mind				619.4727856717126
in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa				11271.474598463421
he proposed the conditions the two harnesses either against one horse or a hundred pistoles				2575.3290360040305
sir cried morrel seizing the moist hand of the paralytic they ask me who i am and what right i have to be here				870.4078600359636
mother exclaimed albert just as madame danglars was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please i want capital to build my plans upon capital nothing replied mercédès with a mournful smile				387.5667071318619
but although her voice sweet full and sonorous vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut				10802.458128436692
apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor voiture do you know scarron what is monsieur voiture ill inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the rue saint honore what is the matter with him he was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die is he then so ill dear voiture asked aramis half hidden by the window curtain				12309.282605750146
what do you prescribe doctor demanded villefort				94.14525968861575
i am waiting my lord till you tell me of what exploits you speak i speak of the adventure eh you know well what i mean alas no my lord replied d artagnan surprised				4516.389705492234
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the ground to fill up the hole while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting place for persons walking in the garden in falling my hand relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the stone				4288.340427461692
the latter were occupied in breaking up the pavement and stretching chains across the streets when headed by the coadjutor appeared the prince de conti the brother of the prince de condé and the duc de longueville his brother in law				1695.8782060144674
the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind				1384.2225756263122
albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young cavalcanti monte cristo was for an instant alone				798.1204769143682
and me too said porthos				14.32755314665117
now gentlemen a sortie cried athos				10.160042347927513
not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great street door which alone afforded the means of egress				554651.9912483637
she was stone dead				610.1718476297128
tell me therefore who are these men who killed the son with despair and the father with famine two men jealous of him sir one from love and the other from ambition fernand and danglars how was this jealousy manifested				737851.2297512694
she appeared to take a great interest in him asked him whence he came who were his friends and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal				385.0144729852637
the queen was ignorant where the mercer s young wife was but had promised to have her sought for but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure d artagnan				87.01613316939711
on their part the three friends had reloaded their arms a second discharge followed the first				1627.1365421832113
the remains of poor renée were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with her				172.70609914838204
now to see things which i can not understand to procure impossibilities these are the study of my life				627.533027317029
night came the two women had watched hoping that when he left his room morrel would come to them but they heard him pass before their door and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps				5498.8286861486185
the dying man s eyes were all the time riveted on the door through which he hoped succor would arrive				6982.151357839252
you are a provident person i see why you see no one knows what may happen				3919.58385783071
while he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door open turned and saw his father				740.0766975323204
why was i a prisoner i do not know said mercédès				3140.703896788337
i hope to kill all four of you but i am more likely to kill the first than the second the second than the third and the third than the last				2160.701732283548
you are going already he said				199.61205373249678
but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter				456691.3582258543

and then resumed d artagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following				14676.316131086587
it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity				2432.178518792175
and that is the only reply you make				4398.794344099357

as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister				1569.390029359113
consequently the procureur is very active in the affair and the prefect of police very much interested and thanks to that interest for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being caderousse s murderers so that in three months if this continues every robber and assassin in france will have the plan of my house at his fingers ends				15386.515618662088
yes without the saddle you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom				51111.2871507012

come come said the sailor i have a better opinion than you of women in general and of mercédès in particular and i am certain that captain or not she will remain ever faithful to me so much the better so much the better said caderousse				464.2644347153678

what s the manner cried athos				10.88712989923478

you here said château renaud passing his arms through the young captain s are you a friend of villefort s				1052.3472047121534
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating				750892.968614057
nevertheless knowing the weakness of her husband and more particularly his cupidity she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose				2192.2949593107137
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse this was d artagnan s mount				24877.792186810042
he immediately signalled it				56.681259615077025

he bowed with great friendship to the count				492.76821428814844
he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains his opinion of me is altered for the better then no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine				1582.352191084143
ask baron franz d épinay i think he tasted them one day yes replied morcerf he said something about it to me but said beauchamp who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you always would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued beauchamp hoping to take him at a disadvantage				6240.605386686925
that s well said he to planchet when the latter added the portmanteau to the equipment				4124.520806507576

and then said madame de villefort endeavoring by a struggle and with effort to get away from her thoughts however skilfully it is prepared crime is always crime and if it avoid human scrutiny it does not escape the eye of god				871.1859978801822
all the mundane objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young man particularly when that young man is a musketeer had disappeared as if by enchantment and for fear no doubt that the sight of them might bring his master back to ideas of this world bazin had laid his hands upon sword pistols plumed hat and embroideries and laces of all kinds and sorts				41404.28907319494

joy shone in raoul s eyes and he leaped lightly to his saddle				2529.4924396462834
franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the classic ground forming the monument of flavius vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his mind even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime				789243.9327222735
but pray sit down thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow				4742.466098818009
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away				473.69536376812215

it appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and crushed me with its weight				7534.135428306533
it is not true said milady in a tone of voice so firm and with a countenance so unchanged that if d artagnan had not been in such perfect possession of the fact he would have doubted				25026.279510766813
she was a perfect linguist a first rate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellow a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer				665783.6297481653
only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes who told you that i had been weeping said she				70.58676153305602

they sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody				9997.007189599033
the woman especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals				702340.3972941398
i faith colonel said d artagnan we are very grateful for your gracious invitation for without you we ran the risk of going without dinner as we have without breakfast				4707.454071198919
a piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum i tasted for i have not eaten or drunk for a long time he had not tasted food for forty hours				3291.6742711723696
the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria				1763.0626878585633
she is speaking said porthos i think she wants to ride on horseback oh she would like it but but what the cardinal won t allow it				84.30792741656566
but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody s professions of friendship				4238.953755866566
aramis bit his lips till the blood came				2959.2412470903546
you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have the abbé smiled				603.1315741397126
besides germain was in the interests of the queen and if anything should happen mme				162.73157281074384
gentlemen he said addressing the two musketeers accompany the royal carriage we are going forward to look for lodgings d artagnan started off for saint germain followed by porthos				243.9714570173959
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security that is policy this policy of louis xiii				899.7748158756426
neither was it as with our neighbors the english an atmospheric influence which darkened his countenance for the sadness generally became more intense toward the fine season of the year				3120.991650161899
besides i care not for his displeasure still situated as we are yes do you know how we are situated				735222.0890987138
now if i die say to d artagnan that i love him as a son and embrace him for me				87.90031968661773
he soon left the pathway of the patrol descended across the rocks and when arrived on the edge of the sea whistled				679120.959936975
sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead				821598.4989375283
see how regularly i live and how easy i am here				602.990668784177
i have seen the bastille				5200.499572651346
you do not know her replied the stranger				1096.6101503905136
you would not fight a duel asked albert in his turn astonished at this strange theory				26957.345739981243
but on the contrary the particulars which are given prove that fernand mondego raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor general is no other than count fernand of morcerf then recollecting the honor you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to you albert still extended on the chair covered his face with both hands as if to prevent the light from reaching him				50.89722371807049
the trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped				5233.261188792347
when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave				667039.4555715709
i have seen milady where demanded d artagnan				1.0879302049924469
a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back				1379.327748287353
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat				3721.193951452804
i look around the boat expecting every moment to see that poor wretch holding between his hands the poniard plunged into his heart oh				1122.5271888704483
but why have two of each sort asked danglars				116.10723658444043
athos invited d artagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine o clock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve				12720.457904428175
and is it your cook who prepares these pills asked beauchamp				151.032084490161
silence said d artagnan pressing her hand more closely				33061.41619730543
to be a bishop aramis answered d artagnan who did not wish to undeceive porthos aramis fancy has become a monk and a jesuit and lives like a bear				39260.87897727386
d artagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence				3148.0687509151257
he did not see the englishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by danglars under the arbor of la réserve and which had the postmark marseilles february delivery o clock p m but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of paper and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be				1182.5219044146986
yes i will not deny it i do await and i do love him of whom you speak and if he does not return instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i will tell you that he died loving me and me only the young girl made a gesture of rage				1812.9321858387057
porthos fancied they were mystifying him and began to curl his mustache and knit his eyebrows but the knee of mme				251.12849412818156
the young man was overwhelmed as he read				6530.929915776105
advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done				611.0837920077092
in getting introduced to her my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at court the part she plays pardieu it is not difficult to divine that after all you have told me				50.249065466337534
the lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief				14883.228663028829
one plays with anybody but one fights only with equals and that is but just said athos and he took aside the one of the four englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low voice				602.4787981635451
the coadjutor alone obtained nothing				398.9074666870015
he reached the hedge and hid himself behind it in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone				778.295228050015
are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man				358.94568491586205
i ought to have consulted you on the point and have had some dishes prepared expressly did you know me better returned the count smiling you would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china				8437.388848822233
and if you were mistaken doctor if it were not my daughter if i should come one day pale as a spectre and say to you assassin you have killed my child hold if that should happen although i am a christian m d avrigny i should kill myself well said the doctor after a moment s silence i will wait villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words				849.9943658659005
his costume of guardsman in the company of m dessessart ought to be his passport				675760.1748304778
my son he said to him you saw a great number of people in the streets as you came here				663.7747928154344
the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière a street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailor but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès				1322.7674889428208
a fearful day when to day we find our friends yes but under what circumstances tis true that our position is an awkward one but let us go in and see more clearly what is to be done things look black enough replied porthos i understand now why aramis advised me to strangle that horrible mordaunt silence cried the gascon do not utter that name but argued porthos i speak french and they are all english d artagnan looked at porthos with that air of wonder which a cunning man can not help feeling at displays of crass stupidity				12283.003493805894
the skiff lightning d artagnan had judged correctly mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none				3596.5653654509124
he is at vincennes did i say monsieur de beaufort				2977.985834941679
it was winter s				975.4522325424339
his visitor appeared slightly uneasy				4123.694864808936
do you wish a step or some place in the government sir will you grant me my request let us hear what it is first sir when you have told me to obey an order did i ever answer let me see that order if however your wish should be one impossible to fulfill when you have cherished a wish and have charged me with its fulfillment have i ever replied it is impossible but a request preferred with so much preparation ah do not fear sir said mordaunt with apparent simplicity it will not ruin you well then said cromwell i promise as far as lies in my power to grant your request proceed sir two prisoners were taken this morning will you let me have them for their ransom				14539.568281099913
no replied beauchamp i have not considered the question a totally different subject interests me what is it the article relative to morcerf indeed				828.3313707029039
i saw the soldier s shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my head so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me well inquired dantès				189.88433777488692
he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door keepers or the coolness of his colleagues				3954.3661714669156
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary				4891.05799294131
was it a transient vision or was he face to face with reality				2742.3190755941846
he jumped out of bed and ran to the window				607.4879109771574
leave them said monte cristo				42.87531495279883
in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the cellar which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful spectacle awaited them				113.2609407153511
all day he toiled on untiringly and by the evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of stone				3481.0537617443156
what the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it				60.75258398744682
are you not mademoiselle julie morrel inquired the man with a strong italian accent				5446.657811333812
bonacieux i say that i have reflected i renew the affair i obtain the letter and i run directly to the cardinal well go quickly				1954.600181684375
yes replied noirtier				249.5236402855335
teresa had become alarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable but as she saw him advance with even step and composed countenance she endeavored to repress her emotion				1275.7572273292446
morcerf who ran towards him with open arms was chilled as he drew near in spite of the friendly smile and simply held out his hand				201.40059693626685
you are strong among the strong mordaunt he said and the frenchmen how did they behave most fearlessly yes yes murmured cromwell the french fight well and if my glass was good and i mistake not they were foremost in the fight they were replied mordaunt				769.8736466303859
alas said d artagnan with the most sentimental air he could assume can you be cruel enough to put such a question to me to me who from the moment i saw you have only breathed and sighed through you and for you milady smiled with a strange smile				401.0854434074665
be ready said porthos as he slipped through the opening				2701.4581320033863
brave rash and enterprising this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts				574302.7306168795
if the stranger expected to produce an effect on morrel he was not mistaken maximilian started as if he had been electrified				665294.9048366789
d artagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions				28921.120579830535
he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead				637.725332099724
he knelt down just opposite the chapel in order not to lose sight of his man and as he had almost forgotten his prayers and had omitted to take a book with him he made use of his time in gazing at bazin				3745.4185442190283
where am i and why am i here				513.4118639552293
i saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness then i heard the well known creaking of the door although i had heard that door open but twice				4566.125040262567
dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon				2804.1831655481456
for the rest as he reckoned upon returning by the same route in seven or eight days if porthos were still at the great st martin he would call for him on his way				613.1792471237914
nor i said athos				8.446763417276898
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a well stuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward				683139.8786209581
our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his majesty was announced				1852.531210220786
no sir before all who are here albert s witnesses looked at each other				583.9987229413327
just god he muttered whence comes this thought				2163.4719304003547
bathed in tears she wandered about the catalan village				4275.395718205475
monsieur du tremblay received d artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake				598549.3241670994
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor				1384.6430905474508
he thought of aramis who without possessing any greater advantages than himself had formerly been the lover of madame de chevreuse who had been to a former court what madame de longueville was in that day and he wondered how it was that there should be in the world people who succeed in every wish some in ambition others in love whilst others either from chance or from ill luck or from some natural defect or impediment remain half way upon the road toward fulfilment of their hopes and expectations				680416.2186788388
you particularly wish it asked he				7.422860712879763
a gentleman has but his word and i have given you mine with a heavy heart d artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry				27998.769668418852
they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same effect as formerly				9173.340788705294
my mother tried to force the door that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside				3162.584884913357
i called to you but you did not answer me i wished to follow you but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours				1907.1554001006414
now where are you going to brussels if you like it is the nearest frontier				39995.504178342875
let us see if she shuts the door after him he muttered				5069.150923018363
yes looked the old man				139.316259557907
what could be his intentions towards him				42.63002035215511
porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied				53354.22270282969
and yet if we burn it who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes he must have one said athos				14.601871729465763
upon this i went and complained to the governor who replied that i only had what i deserved and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who took up their abode in my house so that since that time replied d artagnan totally unable to refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host				1110.6365926208352
yet perchance tomorrow deception will so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness				4591.442920777899
you persist in your incredulity edmond continued faria				8153.718832549633
at last cried d artagnan				1.0979328182466972
what was i saying				19615.964061890714
felton remained in the corridor				5987.947892887738
according to the count s directions danglars was waited on by vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy then having conducted him to the road and pointed to the post chaise left him leaning against a tree				29591.834881534127
athos had followed him with a glance in which the deepest melancholy and pity were expressed				599706.35379287
you foolish fellow said athos laughing				645.9420544206848
but perhaps you have never loved child replied the count				103.91743079760306
but how could he find his way in the darkness of the night				892.1309769983607
bazin who had been standing listening to all this controversy with a pious jubilation sprang toward them took the breviary of the curate and the missal of the jesuit and walked respectfully before them to clear their way				631.1690039635026
one might have thought there was in that cellar one of those famished ogres the gigantic heroes of popular legends into whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity				8218.860549265046
he guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurator s wife of the rue aux ours which was the more probable from the church of st leu being not far from that locality				750144.293817807
no but in the one next to it and as the door will remain open it comes to the same thing				1943.7592062362369
valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear eugénie				558.666104827289
noirtier made a sign that she was to do so				220.0563621516177
all the crowd gave way before morrel				166.41184562455877
i searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years				1180.7183321108193
the good captain leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of m morrel i shall have his place				677.2443063895525
what do you want said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold				2166.3696372584923
pardon me said he smiling pardon me my dear compatriot but i had wholly forgotten you				92.13785374126059
yours is a noble nature he said here is your sword raoul bent his knee to the ground				1242.1256559352548
you have an order signed by the cardinal said the governor				958.6355204559014
save the queen cried mazarin to the coadjutor				2635.922279548574
and that you should fail me d artagnan passed a very bad night				931.7932881417144
but he had reckoned too much upon his strength and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him				65.33134716760702
at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need				12945.308108280462
you will find me ready to follow you they took leave of each other and in ten minutes after having commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin d artagnan was trotting along in the direction of amiens				675373.6123637623
and you have come here with that purpose grimaud repeated the sign				2493.1658630620373
was it not so you were called when your honored brother married us				559.9216907671488
i make a match				13726.17063699815
what do you not know your house asked debray				161.81835142838253
toward the end of the fourth day of the journey athos and aramis reached nanterre which place they cautiously passed by on the outskirts fearing that they might encounter some troop from the queen s army				2123.5931817845085
as to the time it will not require very much more than the generality of wills				558987.7870541787
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another				1005.2030035739872
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me was that my soul if i may say so waked in my sleeping body was that i saw that i heard				1000.488973522065
because she had been branded continued d artagnan				1.0891691465357618
you know that i don t like it				59.49230050731988
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the jew s again what				616.0789554179698
draw nearer penelon said the young man and tell us all about it an old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his hands				542.3361649622834
though his coming was announced in a very low tone madame de saint méran arose from her pillow				31574.84394805742
hark said she we have been overheard				21515.546132392923
to quote some latin verses i have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and i am a valley dear rochefort one of the lowliest of the low then mazarin is still mazarin the same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the queen married if not her husband he is unquestionably her lover you surprise me				90.51499932847179
did she stay long there an hour and a half did she return home directly well my dear bertuccio said the count i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy bertuccio bowed and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had received he started the same evening				711.0636662999501
you are the offended party count doubtless what does that imply that you will fire first i fire first oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that and at what distance twenty paces a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips				571.0079025878989
never commit such an imprudence as to try to escape except in your dreams and you are right my dear la ramee said the duke wiping away the sweat that stood on his brow wide awake though he was after this i will think of nothing but eating and drinking hush said la ramee and one by one he sent away the guards on various pretexts				88079.39983575589
the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking				3377.5522506082702
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside				4478.910078520392
yes buckingham the woman was english then no she was french but she had married in england the monk turned pale wiped his brow and went and bolted the door				205.69766241734473
each of the captains then led his company to the louvre where the king held his review				566156.5450298358

at three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old worm eaten table was a tall young man of twenty or two and twenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled				48310.77633922807

he has about him a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize at first sight the italian or german nobleman				8398.885853947631
he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling				13700.485356854286
oh the magnificent hair said louise with regret				13604.761559563236

at ten o clock the guns of the louvre announced the departure of the king and then a movement similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops ran though the multitude which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard				1467.1396742807392

the jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into dantès plate and dantès after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every day				526.3974509757954

so you see being in constant fear of being forced from that position i am armed to the teeth and yet said d artagnan laughing it appears to me that from time to time you must make sorties and he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans				655390.3541301003

and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical				602672.2293209521
good bye albert said beauchamp suddenly carelessly extending his hand to the young man				296.68396587121555
this silence and this interruption in serving which were unintelligible to porthos had on the contrary a terrible meaning for the clerks				9938.393732927934
our magnificence makes you smile count said maximilian who had followed him with his eyes				654.8148923882809
at five o clock albert returned delighted with his day s work he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction and had received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable sights at rome				1644.3788425666185

the mendicant had gone to his old place on the steps of saint eustache and was again distributing holy water with one hand and asking alms with the other				590.3954802169426

porthos said nothing but he handled in his pocket the fifty pistoles he had gained from groslow with a degree of satisfaction which betrayed itself in his whole bearing				12652.46308354508
d artagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features				4655.642079633227
bonacieux and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other s throat				2283.6951084997086

he bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the prison and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet				24133.40991003843

athos said she wait a moment and she placed her hands on her brow as if to force the fugitive ideas it contained to concentration in a moment				801.5247154798346
be easy kitty there is something between that man and me that he is quite ignorant of he nearly made me lose my credit with his eminence				1893.506146552187

he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate				694722.1374897013

m danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife s favorite sitting room where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness				2710.9724183650633

on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom				3796.3325887894275
oh my god my god				319.5614712613488
i know not whether he is still my friend but since that time i have remained his and these men are in france my lord i believe so tell me their names perhaps i may have heard them mentioned and might be able to aid you in finding them one of them was called the chevalier d artagnan ah my lord if i mistake not the chevalier d artagnan is lieutenant of royal guards but take care for i fear that this man is entirely devoted to the cardinal that would be a misfortune said de winter and i shall begin to think that we are really doomed but the others said the queen who clung to this last hope as a shipwrecked man clings to the hull of his vessel				9244.20376557361
i did not even know that you were the person i was sent to fetch impossible you a favorite of the minister a favorite				500511.764550538
it was the end of november all the verdure of the garden had disappeared the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long bony arms and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet				1020.296770997124
will your majesty pardon me said planchet but is it really the king who is lying there anne of austria started				823.4488653520972
your pardon sir said milady with mildness				66071.5533917403
however they left the castle behind that was the principal thing				1969.9612992398509
the king was winning and as he was very avaricious he was in an excellent humor				1626.518283977502
with your tastes and means of gratifying them continued danglars you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade				5491.308561480033
thanks to m morrel all the forms were got over in a word i was as i told you at my marriage feast and i should have been married in an hour and tomorrow i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust ah said villefort this seems to me the truth				3062.7664653704246
when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodière he arrived at m danglars door just at the same time that villefort s landau after having deposited him and his wife at the faubourg saint honoré stopped to leave the baroness at her own house				392.9144110269001
she cast her eyes upon the table saw the glittering of a knife rushed toward it and clutched it but her disappointment was cruel				610205.0756634825
at a quarter to six o clock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace				2241.7884459439992
he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m de villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy s ears				4971.460242620933
i do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept secret mordaunt followed bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out				482.44566052448175
fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air but did not say a word				713.0006460447959
i promise you that to make up for her want of loyalty i will be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed which seemed to say fear not for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return villefort departed with paradise in his heart				196.7758751611226
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed dantès pressing his hand to his throbbing brows				657680.7026859577
have you really met with some great misfortune oh no monsieur said villefort with a bitter smile it is only a loss of money which i have sustained nothing worth mentioning i assure you true said monte cristo the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial with a fortune such as you possess and to one of your philosophic spirit it is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me said villefort though after all francs are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate chance or whatever you please to call the power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune and may blast the prospects of my child also as it is all occasioned by an old man relapsed into second childhood what do you say said the count francs				1087.746333344113
the countess left the arm of monte cristo and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes				29495.6170251717
he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running				460722.9380676508
no my faith said d artagnan				1.124012589050928
follow me then said the abbé as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès				903.3136641109236
no no cried the abbé impossible dantès endeavored to renew the subject the abbé shook his head in token of disapproval and refused to make any further response				8946.008944400302
death to the guards				1845.3581512080088
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dantès if only to prevent your growing weary of me				119.64622012032792
but i can not i am starving				880905.3323135375
it was ten o clock when they arrived				1761.6836489420803
we have already observed with what rapidity d artagnan seized the expression of a countenance				1689.9191886042274
at length she felt his heart beat a faint breath played upon his lips a slight shudder announcing the return of life passed through the young man s frame				6406.4918097772115
if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival				5453.867124670094
m de morcerf will accompany me bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling carriage would arrive at six o clock				1148.5253921573533
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him				60.97753885674162
oh if you are struck in france if you die in france if i could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death i could not console myself i should run mad				1357.7043406019668
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock				19322.03413180889
d artagnan approved with a movement of the head and porthos with his voice				544.6491420910862
louise slid through the half open gate like a snake and bounded lightly forward				1394.7426043004543
and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve				4942.5665999563935
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if mme				183.83749725915766
in the first place he said making an effort to control himself we are not people who may be treated anyhow my friend there is the viscount of bragelonne and i am the count de guiche				2901.632126263217
but you he said with that light dress and without anything to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold do you know where i am leading you said the countess without replying to the question				1209.7694247911386
when her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face				620.1631956546239
anne of austria sought to read in mazarin s face the occasion of this unexpected visit since the cardinal usually came to her apartment only after every one had retired				1500.417222892687
besides you will strike at the throat porthos it kills as quickly and prevents all outcry very good said porthos it will be a nice little throat cutting horrible horrible exclaimed athos				30.850882722456028
i would rather do so was edmond s reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed				10672.574366642566
the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule				30169.611471686658
a moment said d artagnan				1.0603390912630837
therefore kitty surrendered				656113.2860179449
chapter lxxix				649521.5159286755
it was time for athos whose great courage alone supported him sank upon his knee				4202.622010525869
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown up daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise one s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done but m d épinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family				2539.120160483707
is it as good now oh yes replied andrea laughing				526.4800383832148
no longer could edmond look into those wide open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed				678130.7623896674
the musketeers rode the whole length of the faubourg saint antoine and of the road to vincennes and soon found themselves out of the town then in a forest and then within sight of a village				4487.187189277944
i have seen his servant said one and that applies very well to me well he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening said the other and that applies very well to you what else then the prince said take notice that in all probability he will be disguised as a cavalier which seems to me to leave no room for doubt since you are dressed as a cavalier and not as an officer of musketeers				1147.9920955739765
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion				4228.76255101389
that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said albert you were quite correct in what you said signor pastrini				15825.44657086819
finally at lilliers i lost all trace of her				118.5330451712547
this man was cromwell				2448.9504441845593
yes i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that and the young girl smiled on her grandfather as if he had been a child				1194.9792428781184
twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes				3106.5449571008203
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me alas continued athos the poor abbé was not a st ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature monsieur cried the duchess seizing athos s hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you athos laughed				3368.4681450772878
we have been in this place nearly eighty three hours hem muttered porthos with a kind of pretense of answering				539046.6791245448
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions				684724.8423166259
the blow so they tell me at least was struck with a master s hand mordaunt remembered that cromwell had told him he had had no detailed account and he was now quite convinced that the general had been present at the execution hidden behind some screen or curtain				7052.217150626427
i could kill an ox with a blow of my fist well then family affairs perhaps family				2135.5634170837525
just assume the tone and manner of a husband and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come the bride blushed while fernand restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh sound and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow				1115.1515203160443
raoul delighted at the count s companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay				697876.3349118662
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me if so let dinner be served in her apartments				4372.269838733132
where and when have you seen me trifle with a friend s heart and a king s life				701.0832296006533
put it up again my friend said d artagnan				1.235488417941778
the pope therefore blesses with the fingers				2425.4485219505004
are the half of the sum mother the other will be paid in a year mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be impossible to describe and tears which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her emotion and ran down her cheeks				1987.504299438462
the intelligent creature was received with loud applause				11003.212288763742
the party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor				1376.4007392305173
that is no impediment sir said she i have had greater men than you arrested guitant mazarin sprang forward				1815.5880627550828
i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero				11301.084791364688
but i will answer for these two words being delivered to their address oh my god				447.0724837273369
here i am smiled porthos with his sublime composure				8415.715266391859
valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it				66.87339651410824
oh unhappy woman cried the commissary				13273.95181495139
tut tut answered the abbé man is but man after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known				1843.6167014547966
dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying				3390.991514524368
he is worse than that he is a devil returned the turnkey				4324.658394482973
no we shall beat them by merely temporizing				807585.9219228462
do you think i love you said monte cristo taking the young man s hand affectionately in his				1069.7141802139124
they might have been supposed to be following tracks so observant were they wherever they went				5823.2113242223095
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him				55.25922914925248
sir said he that man has been here what man said andrea carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected				790699.4541913796
a desert island in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity it is very natural this island is a mass of rocks and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation to whom does this island belong to tuscany what game shall i find there thousands of wild goats who live upon the stones i suppose said franz with an incredulous smile				384.4151539843174
let us go on				579.586374131516
you then served louis xviii and you did not show any favor it was your duty today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect him it is equally your duty i come therefore to ask what has become of him villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself				189.04964258298415
bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her d artagnan would have returned home since he had so promised				18046.61730230362
she called the maid and questioned her				472.97694722334325
take care albert said franz				143.52426241704038
they might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their abstraction				630964.1407113251
we will do the same the next moment the door opened and mordaunt appeared on the threshold face to face with d artagnan				33.26277411080282
but that is not all continued danglars he has opened an account with my house for his son may i ask how much he allows the young man five thousand francs per month sixty thousand francs per year				3043.7233469362136
now since the affair of nordlingen they had experienced nothing but reverses the parliament had a plea for calling mazarin to account for imaginary victories always promised ever deferred but this time there really had been fighting a triumph and a complete one				768.5392786831015
the messenger resisted my brother killed him oh said mme				85.45944328782748
the meeting after mercédès had left monte cristo he fell into profound gloom				5385.045683343475
barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes				594.79339581888
you have suffered a great deal sir said franz inquiringly				10599.158519198954
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping				8199.976740137203
then he took the boy upon his knee				4324.992476953026
immediately replied d artagnan we have not a minute to lose hello grimaud				381.03604689854023
but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peter s and a month to study it				115.43490957318151
mademoiselle d armilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with eugénie one of the tableaux vivants of which the germans are so fond				566491.9402175858
to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me				49.278182699099865
well suppose it is a bull fight you are going to see				950.659806525607
ma foi there is no hurry				16302.251934040007
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards père lachaise from the faubourg saint honoré				6200.413921030266
i am fifteen years younger than he is				1027.2757557075772
and your servants too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them				100.69621685930188
the suicide meanwhile monte cristo had also returned to town with emmanuel and maximilian				1340.9092538022321
a few steps in advance of the gate of saint honore they met a third troop this latter party was composed of ill looking fellows who resembled bandits more than anything else they were the men of the beggar of saint eustache				6615.865798744638
that s against all rules				800564.9070243536
when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say he s a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master				2028.5800080642432
come speak avow freely that you accuse him no sire but i say that he deceives himself				211.97870969424557
he clung to one idea that of his happiness destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality he considered and reconsidered this idea devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante				499902.59126482473
but there are no more said she				36.76909380277673
alas said felton looking at those beautiful hands and shaking his head sorrowfully				1889.7150828846436
why do you stop here asked d épinay				2466990.819226507
my apartment will be close to his				1251.0717073615847
and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient well said monte cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house take care said madame de villefort the king s attorney is here ah replied monte cristo since that is the case i will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration your declaration said villefort				162.06421865809787
for the story				2733.8768989849377
d artagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed				35761.280899157806
is it not worth francs to save our father s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure i thought so replied emmanuel but i wished to have your advice this is my counsel our accounts are made up and our bills paid all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office this was done instantly				2538.034352795714
and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do the slave respectfully signalized that he had				739769.1070907518
that concerns your majesty more than me said the cardinal				224.39048603946068
but this time the papers were a mere matter of form				2309.493236913054
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message				27688.72989699711
at what time you please sir replied franz				133.5331887590448
he was received in triumph as if he came from conquering an enemy and not frenchmen				8762.233019227448
he is very susceptible bah said debray he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort you said so yourself true				3650.566618320161
monsieur the cardinal mazarin has been so kind as to think of me he said				314.52358183864885
you have scarcely seen my mother you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely				30226.604992854784
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over				1267.5608943888878
is that monsieur said d artagnan to himself				214.84655345334352
he rose gently so that his head was just above the round of the barrel and under the large hat he recognized the pale face of mordaunt				2549.7071477470336
be careful of your life which is menaced and which will be dear to me from the moment i am not obliged to see an enemy in you				153.0174413122572
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids				678075.1471037221
then assisted by bicarat the only one left standing they bore jussac cahusac and one of aramis s adversaries who was only wounded under the porch of the convent				2363.3843613754716
such a thing is really out of rule eccentric or stupid				28817.298185223197
the duc de beaufort made his entrance at court receiving ample reparation for the wrongs he had suffered and all the honor due to his rank				15473.55596642353
than the son of peter mazarin				176.98221237775113
i my lord said the latter i know a man who has rendered great services to a very popular prince and who would make an excellent leader of revolt				22230.279646035928
nachrichter as say our neighbors the germans and as he bound her while saying these words milady uttered two or three savage cries which produced a strange and melancholy effect in flying away into the night and losing themselves in the depths of the woods				55837.85104264741
i know all these things				2432.599545602098
leave your hold then i beg of you and let me go where my business calls me monsieur said athos letting him go you are not polite it is easy to perceive that you come from a distance d artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs but at athos s last remark he stopped short				7859.555116741995
it was porthos				342.4273677714625
he will answer you the king did so and the moment after three muffled knocks answering the given signal sounded beneath the floor				1394.6494982942568
two hours passed thus during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly				864577.5296674212
come come where either to seek the duc de beaufort or the duc de bouillon and to tell them about this yes but on one condition that we begin by the coadjutor				2569.006405158402
i only request you to give me one by which i may have the pleasure of addressing you				147.82552819989945
the gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went downstairs				3063.634090107598
haydée would it please you not to leave me i am young gently replied haydée i love the life you have made so sweet to me and i should be sorry to die you mean then that if i leave you haydée i should die yes my lord do you then love me oh valentine he asks if i love him				42.82144678240473
so much the worse and so much the better it need not be said that d artagnan was still thinking of the husband				2379.121406905626
and the name of this lord lord de winter lord de winter exclaimed the queen the friend of my husband				2036.587623041113
scarron followed their movements with a glance from the corner of his eye				2593.5938750841474
here is said the englishman taking a quantity of papers from his pocket an assignment of francs to our house by m de boville the inspector of prisons to whom they are due				12898.71342199652
if monsieur aramis hesitates to come he said tell him i am from tours from tours cried aramis				27.076320484756256
d artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task				3260.695941225679
bonacieux d artagnan turned toward her the poor woman reclined where she had been left half fainting upon an armchair				47842.1088280017
franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it				88.41784217835499
then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel or if she be a woman of any consideration they lock her up for life				658.6042316257596
when all had gone out and the door was closed m de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man				280.60275965088687
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscount s age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert				734.2743078162791
i have just killed an old friend indeed replied porthos who that poor count de rochefort well				675.4563177523979
he is a young ingenuous pure man who seems virtuous him there are means of destroying and milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips				504.3148614114618
i can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night				1019.6664418079054
but with his simple musketeer s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back his head and advanced his foot athos instantly took the place which was his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank				13602.14096063093
so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud air let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes you will then be convinced that the resources of the house of danglars however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a million i beg your pardon interposed monte cristo				255.60199817773125
who dares to answer for another man when the wisest when those most after god s own heart hesitate to answer for themselves and who ranges himself on the side of the strongest and the most fortunate to crush the weakest and the most unfortunate impossible madame impossible murmured felton who felt to the bottom of his heart the justness of this argument				758321.8525332424
in that case we will put on an air of mourning and he will pluck for us his black fowls you are very happy exclaimed athos laughing in spite of himself at the sally of the irresistible gascon for you see the bright side of everything what would you have said d artagnan				99.52283311738277
it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would answer some interested end useless injury is repugnant to every mind				618.7197099130735
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially				781618.7076185517
when the day after the arrival of this answer your father came by the advice of monte cristo to ask my daughter s hand for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure				896805.6645860352
your brother in law is a barrister				733641.2674340281
then replied mme				80.53146947126518
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saint méran s				974.6543927143647
who went out this morning athos asked uneasily				1285.928049653263
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence				3895.4102618460565
when they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their feet				954.9864930336498
danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for				962.6050579908851
yes my lord and how much will that cost me monsieur d artagnan zounds my lord i don t know yet				4439.336097150769
he can not make me forget what i shall have lost thus talking they traversed the streets full of people on account of the fete and arrived opposite the old cathedral where first mass was going on				1194.1031955945443
it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys of the assumed existence that you would desire to live no longer but to dream thus forever				2712.3456053391337
parbleu that s good said albert with a gloomy tone				1072.6066638221148
oh yes certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance				1559.0529309522226
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman s hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years				1304.0215086242733
trial it was a stormy and dark night vast clouds covered the heavens concealing the stars the moon would not rise till midnight				37696.805211374645
now as ever i am nothing but your servant then turning to his men allow these gentlemen to pass he said they are friends of the duc de beaufort long live the duc de beaufort cried the sentinels				6355.332864064824
she entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the count s attention				737.1348193356986
what happened then she asked				716.275742778476
why should you expose your game to your adversary				3649.3517938809505
i learn all in the silence of my apartments for instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers and what was to take place this evening then i wrote then remarked the president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings he is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done				675.6979229554853
yes no				323.4631377745703
and now said athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign				11754.956473719965
what is that said he whence comes that cry from the wounded man s room replied the host				578.1347739787103
i am hungry feed me i am bored amuse me it is my duty as your host returned albert ringing the bell while lucien turned over with his gold mounted cane the papers that lay on the table				595.3745324564236
just at this time the famous massacres took place in the south of france				513.8566384598466
off civita vecchia we lost our brave captain leclere and the cargo inquired the owner eagerly				1368.7236074256593
confided to me it shall never escape my lips say albert my friend do you wish it albert threw himself on beauchamp s neck				3632.7053509223947
then you know what i have suffered said mme				90.42281143075756
there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage				995.6660052319536
between the past and the present was an ineffable abyss				13824.33065332685
ah said d artagnan				1.157715316096594
he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence				1910.0995876074485
i confess myself conquered				13435.8527535998
mazarin and guitant conversed together in whispers				842377.761894272
in the struggle her clothes caught fire and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate				3569.4139718788124
there was nothing particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and everything in it was old fashioned while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated				814394.3020746459
no still there but i only speak of him in order that i may introduce the name of another man				285.24431586971724
you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations				26055.918556793553
pardieu gentlemen said he				8.226362300072926
forgive me cried edmond blushing deeply				3949.730342686915
to be sure answered danglars				103.28864688938789
one of my brothers is about to die and i come to prepare him bear with him whispered aramis it is doubtless some spy after my reverend lord bishop said the king to the man i shall hear you with pleasure sir the man retired but not before examining the supposed juxon with an attention which did not escape the king				280.1719811809536
oh he murmured as he left the threshold of the palace ungrateful court				1671.043588078554
let us dispatch said the duke				213.78537504283912
i was going to say that i received a letter almost to the same effect you yes from the abbé busoni no from whom then from an englishman called lord wilmore who takes the name of sinbad the sailor and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the abbé busoni you are mistaken there i am ahead of you you have seen him then yes once where ah that is just what i can not tell you if i did i should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do and what did the letter contain read it you are poor and your future prospects are dark and gloomy				730032.9546372452
chapter lxvii				7208.475544156304
we have made ourselves the constant guardians of our men and while i sleep monsieur du vallon watches ah				422.5325798038938
now said aramis we know how the matter stands				9605.449829777725
nor was this all				343.77152472571646
at any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for i have made a rare acquisition under pretence of being fatigued dantès asked to take the helm the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade				9231.182955897762
then in the evening i shall go to the theatre i shall look like some retired baker				74154.09456741692
at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention				763.7065310800951
the peasant took off his hat on hearing this revered name				764.1443812565137
in truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers				671223.0437734947
the assizes the benedetto affair as it was called at the palais and by people in general had produced a tremendous sensation				8609.087220139809
come recover the procureur dropped his head his teeth chattered like those of a man under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly pale				1041.2223461047888
he sank into his seat and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal letter at which he glanced with an expression of terror				1018.4190918514681
in the corridor he met mme				65.97967831617075
danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror				1095.1793721588188
the footman opened the door and announced monsieur le comte de la fere				3432.085936479218
then some words were spoken by the two women				1405.027663809537
the smugglers dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast				857427.2936228253
what is this gentleman s name asked the commissary				8096.06248937212
planchet had followed the road like athos he had discovered the stains of blood like athos he had noted the spot where the horses had halted				22701.40020860507
the pedestrians ranged themselves against the walls then the trampling of horses and the clashing of steel were heard				940.8458832966968
i have no hope of penetrating sword in hand to paris i know that well				543.5384621032133
i shall complain to m de villefort of the impertinence of his servants madame this is precaution not impertinence no one enters here without an order from m d avrigny or without speaking to the procureur well i have business with the procureur is it pressing business you can imagine so since i have not even brought my carriage out yet				2785.315714694928
on the eleventh the queen in going to mass at notre dame as she always did on saturdays was followed by more than two hundred women demanding justice				2388.6585363962686
then said albert you became the property of this man no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople				667164.786608585
the marshal bit his fingers				2640.2017428368713
guides are useful people who will turn their hands to anything				1626.795966877687
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation				10576.187416909936
one or two shouts of long live the cardinal saluted his shadow but instantly hisses and yells stifled them remorselessly				662323.3369103288
i will return soon to learn the result of your trip the stranger went out				216.71423939235152
a musketeer loves women and he loves them by clasping his arms round them milady waited then with much impatience for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing felton again				527.2608654595824
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the count s agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides				17207.25007690797
he is a little stiff and pompous in his manner and he is disfigured by his uniform but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen years in the austrian service all that will be pardoned				18478.580383926776
about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o clock				1247.695579737257
if a repast were on foot athos presided over it better than any other placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned for him or that he had made for himself				204.2100288356823
the name of the french officer who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares it was evident that he brought the answer of the emperor and that it was favorable and do you not remember the frenchman s name said morcerf quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator				569096.5062430763
but it s all my fault yes it s all my fault because it is myself who selects my men				464.30605574524304
the citizen followed him				43.43310229822382
this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not				353.91126265432604
you will have sufficient time before five o clock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station				41786.97016506434
i felt in bending my head toward you your beautiful hair touch my cheek and every time that it touched me i trembled from head to foot				2379.822602473833
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet				977.9093578044483
sheathe then if you please and follow us monsieur said aramis parodying jussac it would afford us great pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves but unfortunately the thing is impossible monsieur de tréville has forbidden it				78.00730401562554
now the mischief is out depend upon it the custom house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor dantès hidden treasures mercédès however paid no heed to this explanation of her lover s arrest				3594.6005398392285
do you say that m noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry m le baron franz d épinay yes sir that is the reason said villefort shrugging his shoulders				924.3952218557038
alarmed by the cries and gestures of the boatmen my horse sprang into the water				1463.0444231984184
you are aware sir of the deplorable condition of my husband s father yes madame m de villefort spoke of it to me a paralysis i think alas yes the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless the mind alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the light of a lamp about to expire				555931.4256184633
let us see i have told you				181.9048196896875
don t be uneasy on that score replied villefort no ceremony will be neglected in my house				407.675819150809
for i presume it was when you left me that you went to visit her at the hotel de ville my dear fellow what				625.661738782234
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy d artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him				44.350819452587224
d avrigny unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion turned away and villefort without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn extended his hand towards the young man				258.9718330625012
at châlons i was put upon the saône thence i passed on to the rhône whence i descended merely with the current to arles at arles i was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to marseilles				1754.5962775348953
but the eye of love had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash				776274.5835988396
edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first story				2696.629293031217
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne				771802.6969258691
then he advanced but before they could meet the vessel again changed her course				2406.381899640976
if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping the scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbé s plan has not even the merit of originality then turning to faria i inquired if you are well fed said he				154.82359871661637
during ten minutes he alone kept the crowd at bay at last comminges appeared pushing broussel before him				52.252255601033184
you were at the festival of your marriage said the deputy shuddering in spite of himself				281.25459525039395
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself				1447.791886685627
when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered you my heart was softened when you arrived here i allowed you to enter				2262.73592962618
morrel took leave of him at the door renewing his promise to be with him the next morning at seven o clock and to bring emmanuel				1469.4522298452057

i know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastret s warehouse and at smyrna from pascal s that is all i was obliged to know and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars now i recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me there you see exclaimed danglars				515.2586257697723
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day				508.15247753811747
she spoke some words to lord de winter in english who thereupon requested d artagnan s permission to retire excusing himself on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away and charging his sister to obtain his pardon				6445.738094489971
well she said at length do you not answer me i have but one question to ask you what do you intend to do i was going to ask you replied the baroness with a beating heart				316.46424166153963
the villefort family vault two days after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten o clock in the morning around the door of m de villefort s house and a long file of mourning coaches and private carriages extended along the faubourg saint honoré and the rue de la pépinière				729250.8297285261
i am the bearer of a letter that is all				393.2292955360811
come come said d artagnan more reason why we should start on our journey				1982.4839655444023
whilst d artagnan and porthos were engaged in conducting the cardinal to saint germain athos and aramis returned to paris				510.6110270794229
maximilian morrel said the servant announcing two fresh guests				2561.789075806187
porthos is in picardy then aloud and he has taken his ancient name of vallon to which he adds that of bracieux an estate which has been a barony by my troth so that porthos will be a baron i don t doubt it				108.53562672028139
peste i thought you somewhat corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward but i see you have other strings to your bow				6087.33930574519
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison no sir not at this moment at least sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating				754253.9989702089
however scarcely was the imperial power established that is scarcely had the emperor re entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers he found on the table there louis xviii s half filled snuff box scarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in spite of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad				662044.2105297417
bonacieux wept all day like a true mercer not being at all a military man as he himself informed us				518.5436691550751
i am not mistaken d artagnan cried rochefort				465.314955715961
god has so willed it said he with the resignation of a fanatic but without however being able to take his eyes from that ship on board of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of her to whom he had sacrificed his life				711.6280886584746
this insolent boy chastises others cried he and i hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before will not escape him replied the stranger knitting his brow				1159.0124679276098
he returned to mercédès with tears in his eyes and heaving breast and without uttering a word he gave her the letter				731.8508696016072
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain				1996.084432149438
a minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened and monte cristo appeared				869.4367869102279
he was the friend of the king who honored highly as everyone knows the memory of his father henry iv				1590.4902191808333
mordaunt bowed with a smile of triumphant ferocity				16504.220611480185
there he cried				1625.4196521472443
yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices				817141.3356195788
have you any money d artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket				803.2200197010635
raised to the height of twenty feet so as to be on a level with the window it had two lower stories				3061.9574879929073
now my lord said the poor man let me have the poire d angoisse				3049184.195516059
coquenard gently advised him to be patient				6235.715166536191
what is this said aramis to juxon				78558.57230783602
he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma the one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with gold				2448.2627356770267
during the scene of tumult andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly then leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said gentlemen i assure you i had no idea of insulting the court or of making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly				5556.335101514189
that great man who was so revered by d artagnan the elder served as an object of ridicule to the musketeers of tréville who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back				1309.6603871555928

no dear morcerf you know i only refuse when the thing is impossible				1595.6382422599575
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity				2519.5708112305847
in fact said the cardinal placing his hand upon a bundle of papers i have here a whole pile which concerns you				132.8115590659937

there s a providence that watches over the deserving				628993.5359055854
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty				1819.2677179189943
this was the departure of fernand of fernand whose crime she did not know and whom she regarded as her brother				2008.1975682134075

the other was forced to wait and it was easily to be seen how he cursed the delay				5691.3229133352625
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word i will keep it returned morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons				537580.4786480407
now said d artagnan i am going to call this soldier and talk to him				43.28646106360984
athos waved his flag turning his back on the guards of the city and saluting those of the camp				2506.2355670698707
ah thought the gascon he looks displeased				724984.8384375157
he made a rapid and brilliant feint which mordaunt parried				717435.6181735453
as d artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been seen				5551.509868945647
athos is going to examine the castle which it will be necessary to render impregnable in case of siege porthos will see to the provisions and aramis to the troops of the garrison				5449.271189945638
however the duke contrived to hide the ball under his bolster and as soon as the door was closed he tore off the cover of the ball with his teeth and found underneath the following letter my lord your friends are watching over you and the hour of your deliverance is at hand				211.22005507511304
he thought several times of the project the count had of visiting paris and he had no doubt but that with his eccentric character his characteristic face and his colossal fortune he would produce a great effect there				484.3440612877525

listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy if you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to god what do you say				669.6619246721959
d artagnan held the bridle of athos s horse and porthos that of aramis				695.3696727072381
mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed				670.2011532911745
what asked athos				10.036951777916634
no was the old man s reply i will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him i heard all this from the window for i was anxious that mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment s repose but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abbé				741.5504453583117
the idea was welcomed by the prince to whom it was of little importance whom he married so long as he married some one				700.1985551295194
they dragged us away by force				3276.459381545073
and bazin asked athos				14.711821044562589
then a strange reaction took place he who had just abandoned endeavored to save the francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privation he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness				4046.1805487646952
i think you hailed me mademoiselle julie said he				7.610909959290383
as little sensitive as was the heart of d artagnan he was touched by this mute sorrow but he held too tenaciously to his projects above all to this one to change the program which he had laid out in advance				3907.893888731839
no monseigneur				3075.349111694483
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away				409.14478066196904
there she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapestry				21090.525883622777
i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted				54754.61162333912

excuse my putting such a question to you it is not indiscreet returned morcerf with the simplicity of conviction				6883.612072607189
let us consider first the ancient rights				572470.8708864341
what blows what blood he fainted				2737.09872273055
he he is murmured grimaud pale as a ghost and seizing his master s hand				192.73483759396493
it was athos he had recognized and porthos who was boring a hole through the wall				896.6332601360415
the young man was more pale than usual and his eyes reddened by want of sleep denoted that he had passed a feverish night				942.6565005701342

between the forest and this accursed spot a little behind the trampled ground was the same track of small feet as in the garden the carriage had stopped here				933.3959713131518
an angel alone could have saved one of us from death that angel came from heaven if not to make us friends which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each other monte cristo with moistened eye heaving breast and lips half open extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful fear				2149.6379146096765
madame more hopeless than he thinks				861681.7098565089
the return d artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation				38567.6170297965
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor				1260.1609044743648
valery but listen				2989.1908951106793
faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt				2634.879254241886
did you never hear talk of a young woman who was carried off one night there now				1415.126726221616
the palace rose from the bosom of the water and to see the number of boats around it one would have fancied one s self not in paris but in venice				14428.621928088898
when he was quite a child and only a shepherd i gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way and he in order to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own hand and which you may have seen in my collection of arms				514.3503577351263
the king don carlos has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges and has returned to spain by the catalonian frontier				28330.323267413813

sir said he here is monsieur d artagnan s answer but i did not tell you there would be an answer stupid said athos				12.684202877471334
you promised to obey me implicitly				869188.9869313034
you told me yourself that that ring that ring i have				5071.109200386396
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinal s hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin				1104.3443860072207
and now that you have obtained what you want go said she monsieur de gondy whenever her majesty has need of me replied the coadjutor bowing her majesty knows i am at her command ah cursed priest cried anne when he had retired stretching out her arm to the scarcely closed door one day i will make you drink the dregs of the atrocious gall you have poured out on me to day mazarin wished to approach her				155.82940397904758
i believe with your majesty that monsieur de tréville s guarantee is more than sufficient tréville bowed very respectfully with a joy that was not unmixed with fear he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding				669857.1216835058
two persons were coming down the stairs he had only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them				115.86676222075432
the chevalier raised his head saw the two young women and without stopping waved his hand in a friendly way to milady				603.5398103164932
the thirty two that we shall use tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the forehead that is perfectly admirable but what do you do count with all these horses you see i travel with them but you are not always travelling when i no longer require them bertuccio will sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale but no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them then he will sell them to some eastern vizier who will empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his subjects count may i suggest one idea to you certainly it is that next to you bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in europe you are mistaken viscount i believe he has not a franc in his possession then he must be a wonder				7497.229975128729
sir i am ready				1795.273701634364

i believe i saw him mount a gray horse and leave the palace court				1371.735671450668
they were anxious about you here i simply told them where you were				3997.4205882705983
a quarter of an hour was the reply				1106.9942136024567
it was still about a quarter full as we before stated				51167.909720470234
the two kingdoms are so near that france must be interested in our situation as we are interested in that of france				592.9040928593133
while his horses were impatiently pawing the ground held in by the coachman who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance gate and cast out on the doorsteps m andrea cavalcanti as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess				4758.65351276103
alone never again to see the face never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth				2704.062749326237
the young man was too well acquainted with the business of the house not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the morrel family				2251.019766966875
has such and such a perfume done anything for me				83.52182341169717
it is an old man s caprice and is there no means of making him revoke his decision yes said madame de villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor the count who perceived that m and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird s water glass				1469.9981682974076
monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of morrel who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen				32639.238957518257
to you alone then may i confide my sorrows and my hopes the paralytic motioned yes valentine took maximilian s hand				209.57442883261615
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued d artagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen aramis colored imperceptibly				6831.658951472271
gondy bowed respectfully				7506.494835835342
the blow was parried				763221.3283878341
have i not been there once yes but at that period we were not at war				2974.473372604963
you can not at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each other if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement				5027.9328073756
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations				529444.4612624019
my dear landlady said d artagnan i beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from flanders and whom i am going to take into my service my brother wish your sister good morning master peter wilkom suster said planchet				379.23502359983485
it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our secret and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you				108.28031536397586
perhaps if i employed my strength against women i might perchance find them weaker than myself and consequently conquer them but it is with men that i struggle and i am but a woman to them				110.0048361844509
for the first three days i heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth i heard nothing				377.3016161531621

i have not your confidence i fear the cardinal hush said mme				66.43143280230105
this person walked along the terrace which was ornamented with flowers				3113.8445574962157
i have only kept this secret so long from you continued faria that i might test your character and then surprise you				74.26856346262439
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation				735806.3894537627
for master broussel who is arrested because he has defended the people				785.9779732314429
monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him				42.688349549938074
why your protégé m andrea cavalcanti ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize m andrea at least not as concerns m danglars and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young man really needed your help in that quarter but happily for me he can dispense with it what do you think he is paying his addresses i am certain of it his languishing looks and modulated tones when addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim his intentions				3671.917891798814
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fro of busy people				787.4883008743658

one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced beauchamp				306.7930453479915
i sank on my knees my hands clasped round one of the bedposts then i felt that i was lost felton became frightfully pale and a convulsive tremor crept through his whole body				1202.43100047323
by the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes the doctor without shaking hands with villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household				44969.99817730502
doubtless although less evident monte cristo s joy was not less intense				24817.15313824776
you have already tried the power of your seductions upon many men and unfortunately you have always succeeded but i give you leave to try them upon this one				697.6340510219911
what is this light asked he				7.021536019859753

baron danglars one two three four five said monte cristo five millions why what a crœsus you are this is how i transact business said danglars				102.96527388836161

i congratulate you				69.84874850010941
there is but little reason why i should delay you				77.59070058957711
yes replied noirtier				249.5236402855335
but i know you to be a man of honor the count again struck the gong				31650.42534349729
yes frankly and loyally replied the cardinal in the same tone				1016.8881124521545
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him				43.65591643398987

twelve hours delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next morning				699.026947440477
he began by moving his bed and looked around for anything with which he could pierce the wall penetrate the moist cement and displace a stone				3462.311060790675
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there				501.8124442262486
if he wished to go out without gloves his hands appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished				29368.88666726401
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel				15217.920555252986

i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted haydée s arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands				679928.4242187263
you don t know him no did you never see him yes i have seen him but i don t know what he calls himself your name replied the commissary				16009.732093347799

planchet grimaud bazin and mousqueton presented themselves and received clear positive and serious orders from athos				548.339848400634
a sob was the only sound he heard				991.0458459723424
this lackey was my compatriot and we became the more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between us				697.426835968861

for that night madame that night you loved me i will swear it my lord yes it is possible that the influence of the place the charm of the beautiful evening the fascination of your look the thousand circumstances in short which sometimes unite to destroy a woman were grouped around me on that fatal evening but my lord you saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered				24456.806701955033
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule				31692.681218576927
the latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost senseless				800219.1261006403
every man has a devouring passion in his heart as every fruit has its worm that of the telegraph man was horticulture				632940.9193218477
the most dreadful misfortunes the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to light and liberty and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant so unbounded so unheard of that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs				748327.2527662918
the devil take you said aramis				10.273560274417994

i have been heaven s substitute to recompense the good now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked at these words he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to sea				980.2974113787656
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear				2059.0345462300997
oh make yourself easy on that head said ali smiling selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter				863.3246645300147
i used to play almost every night in france and since your return to england i have not handled a card or dice box i sincerely pity you said d artagnan with an air of profound compassion				664341.3389683776
almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight horses excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning				1418.1130974101368
act then as you think proper there is still time to withdraw no monsieur no you appear to be an honest young man and i will have confidence in you				168.09284694364285
athos threw himself on the muzzle of the gun and arrested the shot which was about to be fired				9713.653630164947
d artagnan who was known as a familiar of the house went straight to his office and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance				3313.5988322985313
i dread this marriage maximilian as much as you thank you my adored valentine thank you that is enough				1794.216787155694

if you can my dear d artagnan answer for mademoiselle oh monsieur be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting paris then said aramis this falls out very well he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring and gave the billet to kitty				2364.5859948982848
you said just now that you had a hundred friends very true but you introduced me at m danglars not at all				301.1212042212677
my poor eugénie you must conceal your passion for the fine arts i admire all that is beautiful returned the young lady				3062.556169106964
athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door amid the red color in which the house was painted				560109.4709610222
but said d artagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ah yes said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment				700038.7116944011
it is miserable do you see always to wait till the end of the month oh said andrea philosophically determined to watch his companion narrowly does not life pass in waiting				2710.0418396021987

groslow began turning the cards one after another				961.6975724293233
that milady s son has left england that he is in france on his road to paris if he be not here already the devil he is said porthos				26.909991123707847
d artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine india linen to implore her pardon but she with a strong movement tried to escape				2012.829944967234
cocles had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure				1753.8777365955639
assuredly said d avrigny				692.9708733057729
no doubt my boy no doubt				1220.6637874268076
he had formed his resolution				13665.748306375253
in the meanwhile the promises of m de tréville went on prosperously				800174.1016100883
no positively i will not go				980.65600514157
who employed you to assassinate me a woman whom i don t know but who is called milady but if you don t know this woman how do you know her name my comrade knows her and called her so				254.11828185137858
as soon as the enemy are within musket shot we must fire upon them				99.75254847497757
but there as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the jolly miller without anyone host waiter or hostler coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse d artagnan spied though an open window on the ground floor a gentleman well made and of good carriage although of rather a stern countenance talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect				6704.891753016485
a single portrait signed by léopold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame				5770.906482032253

no no answered dantès don t imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby manner				835.41462761283
i do not know her but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature and that there is something fatal about her you are right said d artagnan i will have done with her				138.1020384158572
i am cold i am hungry				15983.218166449937
but hark				27463.142945322055
at the end of five hundred paces more or less they came to a rivulet which they forded				716429.1824741131
when the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted brows				635245.4986364407
now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine he is a very rich englishman eccentric almost to insanity and his real name is lord wilmore ah indeed				1326.808522831935
the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent				744964.2139053788
no one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad but you who must know that i am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will alas murmured edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse				673299.6245172161
the bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his and in spite of his efforts to prevent it the eyes of edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last vainly calling for his son				990.9522820272749
well said the count what are you doing you must excuse us count returned franz but we have still much to do what may that be we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them do not concern yourself about that we have i think a private room in the piazza del popolo i will have whatever costumes you choose brought to us and you can dress there after the execution cried franz				854.2086425547467
dantès glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with hand in mid air				743.2181217542641
he felt the need of making a trip in the ile de france and begged us the comte de la fere and monsieur du vallon to accompany him				47.69775713345827
to the sword sir				737.2234009623685
how can i understand				888.7473875850369
that cousin of aramis that marie michon that needlewoman notwithstanding her low condition had acquaintances in the highest rank she called the grandest ladies of the court her friend and the queen proud as she is in her double character as austrian and as spaniard called her her sister alas said madame de chevreuse with a slight sigh and a little movement of her eyebrows that was peculiarly her own since that time everything has changed and the queen had reason for her affection for marie was devoted to her devoted to that degree that she served her as medium of intercourse with her brother the king of spain which interrupted the duchess is now brought up against her as a great crime and therefore continued athos the cardinal the true cardinal the other one determined one fine morning to arrest poor marie michon and send her to the chateau de loches				715803.6078126325
he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him				59.02029313520643
the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but napoleon returned a special levy was made and fernand was compelled to join				782213.7709509509
the clock of the invalides struck a quarter to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes				22346.591714270588
he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a seat as if he had been in m morrel s salon				3175.0991497252494
silence purveyor of gossip do not spread that report				5838.943238382725
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth				1974.883059755865
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required i know it said athos coolly since here it is and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels				4284.7430186950305
the squares were broken to shivers and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room				183.8162846300496
international donations are gratefully accepted but we can not make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states				3378.847374956057

yes a passage of st augustine upon which we could not agree said the gascon				245.4061096609887
athos perceived this embarrassment and by way of supplying an effectual remedy called for four bottles of champagne				14506.07888989823
mon dieu				18722.503942860425
the image of devastation and death as the ancient poet says reigned as over a field of battle of fifty large sausages suspended from the joists scarcely ten remained				6713.69606199545
excellencies said he the coach is ready well then said franz let us to the colosseum by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies by the streets morbleu by the streets cried franz				381.3266834252993
you heard cavalcanti that tells me their name and nothing else ah				243.9588931980324
he was a man of forty to forty five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion				4406.003089013763
i was there at a fearful moment				1347.1386015990668
you should have allowed me to sleep				1062.317703591934
come finish your cup of coffee said monte cristo the history is ended chapter				267.57727354202166
there was a musketeer who was in love with one of my women				1368.728828701821
and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking glass				1540.3509340587282
but i am really glad to have seen such a sight and i understand what the count said that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only one that causes you any emotion without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study character said the count on the steps of the scaffold death tears off the mask that has been worn through life and the real visage is disclosed				856564.2303368418
ah said louise breathing freely here we are out of paris yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied eugénie				492.1886489400248
the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of valentine				1310.2231778011248
lake maggiore				734513.5555152658
it however became necessary for one of them to break it first and as d artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion aramis said you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas yes efficacious grace has touched you as that gentleman said just now oh these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time				424.21626225412535
upon my return home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure				875441.5556612199
as for aramis he went off to the bishop s palace to see if he could possibly pass in with juxon to the king s presence				2534.7893843264987
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo				407.0420015465953
the general who had almost fainted revived				82559.51922726384
oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm remain said caderousse				77.45019806652014
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground				1343.3552510637574
besides you forget cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner				2965.6403309699776
i wished to inquire why you stopped at the island of elba i do not know sir it was to fulfil the last instructions of captain leclere who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand then did you see him edmond who the marshal yes morrel looked around him and then drawing dantès on one side he said suddenly and how is the emperor very well as far as i could judge from the sight of him you saw the emperor then he entered the marshal s apartment while i was there and you spoke to him why it was he who spoke to me sir said dantès with a smile				392.8005149736664
still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerf s				975.47409398532
and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the letter itself				2667.512610194173
this devil of a fellow he muttered shaking his head i said at the time he would create a sensation here and i measure his effect by an infallible thermometer				788757.0978936981
we shall meet again master d artagnan continued the leader raising his voice				525.9435771502835
his granddaughter				33671.690788263455
nineteen returned dantès				524.4207354798207
vicomte said athos to raoul follow the duchess beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend the fair indian approached scarron				3401.77103589017
i know you now				793.6464828327714
can they have received any news my lord not from england madame				987.6143446321878
d artagnan was standing at the door looking after porthos with a mournful gaze when the baron after walking scarcely more than twenty paces returned stood still struck his forehead with his finger and exclaimed i recollect what inquired d artagnan				89.32500294868017
as to his title and fortune as to that madame i have made over to him the estate of bragelonne my inheritance which will give him ten thousand francs a year and the title of vicomte upon my soul monsieur said the duchess you are a true nobleman				12732.898437194846
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte cattini here is the priest s certificate yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with astonishment				1070.1386505269427
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach				35486.097747287466
dear friend to an englishman interrupted athos well commenced				5013.243215938028
the sultan the liberty of a woman replied the count the pope the life of a man so that once in my life i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne and it was peppino you saved was it not cried morcerf it was for him that you obtained pardon perhaps returned the count smiling				646.321016825906
this was now all changed				9921.537220568209
death is now perhaps striking a fourth blow				1534.582010549141
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune besides they say i am already rich in right of my mother too rich even				791353.5030327459
and now you will do me a favor will you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen and should they wish it you will warn me just then the count felt his arm pressed				865045.9869530249
by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt				29073.660058275796
wild dreams had disturbed his repose				2277.741965292813
with my usual fatuity i doubted it now i am convinced				9005.148242029696
dantès dug away the earth carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice				714568.4073714669
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet				684336.4148558789
the movement was executed in silence and with precision				72141.39180452745
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention				711.6718636671035
the devil take this gout athos and aramis took their leave but even in the ante chamber they could still hear the duke s cries he was evidently suffering the tortures of the damned				598476.8342751239
go my friend reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall come you think then all is not over yet said albert horror stricken				64350.23538934616
it was plain by a paleness still greater than usual and by those traces which loss of sleep leaves on the face that he must have passed almost the whole of the night without sleeping				8492.99572405152
he had fallen asleep and was in a profound slumber when d artagnan returned				1011.372469530001
this time i will know the assassin and will pursue him let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said d avrigny				1062.825390526357
she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter				2605.474985342033
i have measures to take she will escape us replied the young man she will escape us and it will be your fault athos i will be accountable for her said athos				25.429076146857525
his musketeers proceeded and followed him				41.78635843087906
provincial diffidence that slight varnish the ephemeral flower that down of the peach had evaporated to the winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three musketeers gave their friend				710.1961982286356
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg™ electronic works				2983.1364157437815
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eugénie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone haydée may hear you perhaps and you think she would be angry no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression				3062.2027870760594
he was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his hand				198.94650789439737
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another				908.1594453914406
i shall call you presently patrick went out				202.01490931009494
the devil cried aramis you have a magnificent horse there porthos yes replied porthos it is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first				1775.6962861272575
they fear the ear that hears their orders and the eye that scrutinizes their actions				4345.300208481643
how should i know what horse furniture is you should have left it to me then madame who know what they are but you wished to be frugal and consequently to lend at usury it was wrong monsieur porthos but i will repair that wrong upon my word of honor how so asked the musketeer				829.8815327561124
a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume stood in the salon				2898.613285809297

now as at the moment in which d artagnan fixed his eyes upon the gentleman in the violet doublet the gentleman made one of his most knowing and profound remarks respecting the béarnese pony his two auditors laughed even louder than before and he himself though contrary to his custom allowed a pale smile if i may be allowed to use such an expression to stray over his countenance				1591.7671268217393
