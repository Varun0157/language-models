however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at francs each he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars				451.4266627967899

at this moment hope makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible				437304.15849139483
d artagnan however who had consulted with aramis spoke to the poor wretch				5672.173819973077
his name or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to pronounce his name reached him				77.55522749500877
to troyes in champagne i answered				9041.729841102055
i won back your harness then your horse then my harness then my horse and then i lost again				434.16341758168244

not at all i assure you but where will you manage to stow me in the chamber overhead surely that is where you yourselves sleep never mind that we have a second bed in the adjoining room caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment				573.0260439505649

just god he muttered whence comes this thought				2627.493150134691
my money boxes are my pactolus as i think m demoustier says and i will not retard its course or disturb its calm				4083.9826010608585

i understand said monte cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions				203387.4308992444

aramis dug his nails into his flesh and groaned aloud				4701.41524503816
i want to be enlightened on a subject then when i shall have learned what i desire to know i will withdraw be enlightened said athos phlegmatically				680555.0964809406
no aramis replied				2305.8641614900703
and to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter said debray				513.9377484464761

mother and son chapter				174.80882552186088
be it then as you desire				8227.039771667844
then d artagnan became almost wild				61630.81775329735
his features were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time				319.1737502772947
i say there for as i did not consider my house safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no right to possess anything independent of your husband i have kept this sum now your whole fortune in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there				890.1130323802134
but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world				708.9493763252433
yes and i would rather face your majesty however threatening your smile than face those demons who accompanied me hither and who sprung from i know not whence unless from deepest hell bravo said d artagnan in a whisper to porthos well answered well said the queen biting her lips whilst her courtiers looked at each other with surprise what is the desire of my people that broussel shall be given up to them madame never said the queen never your majesty is mistress said la meilleraie retreating a few steps				1409.0955657204602
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking				198134.24720816256
he was excessively delighted and threw himself into his friends arms				501.47636445628575
my affianced husband returned				803.377833324806
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to say valentine has been assassinated villefort hung his head d avrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes				333.8547902166449
this was the room appropriated to the sailors				2350.805138777007
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn				35858.1666989908
do you hear the guns pray				78232.00549080007
the ambassadors				67906.16798993186
four shots replied to them almost instantaneously but much better aimed than those of the aggressors three soldiers fell dead and one of the pioneers was wounded				2348.4456004066296
i could not help thinking so just now the idea came over my mind and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance excuse the remark i do not think it likely sir mademoiselle de villefort is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young lady				2997.3407752147614
what upset him completely was that the four friends seemed to have no acquaintance with one another				747.6338244712982
the host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they wished				10848.440946796478
at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away				572.0372224154933
i say that the diamond is real and that this gentleman one of the first jewellers of paris will give us francs for it				91.4264549254074
this was a very easy matter for a woman so really superior as she was				1059.2605074916214
really i like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him yes he is to marry mademoiselle de villefort indeed and you know i am to marry mademoiselle danglars said albert laughing				2033.513435356813

my lord i shall send this evening to your eminence in order to reinforce the troop of monsieur de comminges the ten men you demand				26236.021472239034
bertuccio said he give fifty five thousand francs to monsieur the steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of bank notes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there				951.3291274786675
la ramee sent away the guards desiring them to drink to the duke s health and as soon as they were gone shut all the doors put the keys in his pocket and showed the table to the prince with an air that signified whenever my lord pleases the prince looked at grimaud grimaud looked at the clock it was hardly a quarter past six				5134.713735869854
by this means the end of the month was passed but his resources were now exhausted				3599.64678163492
four hundred and seventy five livres said d artagnan who reckoned like archimedes				267768.7538695154
is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty				3609.4438281005087
as to that you must leave it to me i give you absolute power therefore take as large an escort as you like d artagnan shook his head				475.9490733180951
it need not be said that if in the depths of the heart there is a sentiment more tender it reaches then quite naturally the highest exaltation of which it is capable				7843.045001832597
let me know my crime and the reason why i was condemned				277721.01058178995
you say you desire my mother s good opinion i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent do you think so said monte cristo with interest				7416.989954457237
albert listened with the most profound attention				2068.485609934704
they had expected maximilian since the previous evening				531.7295353163361
two of the men appeared bearing the woman in their arms and carried her to the carriage into which the little old man got after her				248.49715682267092
oh beauchamp beauchamp how shall i now approach mine				1304.407085281674
the order given by mordaunt to the sergeant had been heard by d artagnan who accordingly by an expressive glance warned athos and aramis to exercise extreme caution				370707.19601094234
the astonishment of mazarin and of anne of austria was great when it was announced to them that the city which the previous evening they had left entirely tranquil had awakened to such feverish commotion nor would either the one or the other believe the reports that were brought to them declaring they would rather rely on the evidence of their own eyes and ears				2888.468011364329
i have already made my excuses to the count for quitting him and i pray you to do so also				1653.5406149761031
let us attend to what is more pressing first and then we will attend to my wound besides it does not seem very dangerous and they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country house of the worthy functionary				241944.44052312107
the king looked at his old friend with tears in his eyes undid the order of the saint esprit which he wore to honor the two frenchmen who were with him and passed it around winter s neck who received on his knees this striking proof of his sovereign s confidence and friendship				1397.749940905115
i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris for the cause which today takes us to england and what is this cause demanded aramis				250.85669498032263
speak madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart				402.38845450595943
now after what you told me this morning of your heart i may believe well count replied morrel gayly i will not dispute it but you will not make me your confidant maximilian said the count in a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the secret				1474.3504871488094
athos found much less difficulty than he had expected in obtaining an audience of anne of austria				3098.3433863652645
while you have been returning hither he will have escaped and we shall never find him come now aramis said d artagnan you must be taking me for some one else nevertheless said athos in your absence well in my absence haven t i put in my place grimaud and the scotchman				5369.1488962175035

these were the reasons which added to the fatigue caused andrea to sleep so soundly				12768.673419258552
well said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear not to be recognized well				654.2421824514065
the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave countenance to volunteer assistance				2823.3238155840118

ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others brave athos murmured d artagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence				423034.8033452124

albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian matters speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew there				946.7228250040611
the duchess remained a moment stupefied then suddenly bursting into laughter ah				338.86298638055524
all at once he started				1106.4079209269735

he stepped forward				613.1783699644698

no cardinal said d artagnan but only his lantern where the devil then is he exploring however one of the side wings of the gallery after making a sign to porthos to explore the other he saw all at once at his left a tub containing an orange tree which had been pushed out of its place and in its place an open aperture				364097.0679459914

but his majesty s decision is always necessary and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours d artagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeer s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it				90.61302764999951
listen i am already upon the scent resumed d artagnan				65.2473519965956
certainly not				530.4524268725748
and you fancy he will not put his maxim into execution now that he has got hold of the king on the contrary i am certain he will do so				544.6816066772382
the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated				258795.82472090737
i should be carried home in triumph like monsieur broussel and athos would proclaim me the french brutus				311052.9486504812
meantime he was going to try to find out milady				795.2591386889643
yes my pocket has a hole in it oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling				352040.8485315764
we may well pity the poor fellows said the abbé				987.5309933241732
the porter got up as eugénie expected and even advanced some steps to recognize the person who was going out but seeing a young man striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it immediately				1350.7954050724022
and without losing a minute thinking he saw an opening he thrust his right in and forced mordaunt to parry a counter en quarte so fine that the point of the weapon might have turned within a wedding ring				2503.489615169259
he was the man who had proposed to carlini the health of their chief and to whom carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face				984.5477022279055
a surgeon cried m de tréville mine				1341.3082958694374
well then we ll do our best having said that they went out of the stable well what matters all that to us said d artagnan				56.42373159625103
his eyes rested upon the spot where had stood his bed since then removed and behind the bed the new stones indicated where the breach made by the abbé faria had been				5060.625527046587
pray put no construction on my words i do not mean they should convey and give them no undue weight no said albert the engagement is broken off well said beauchamp				551.0188442376714
raoul had been there about ten minutes during five of which he was lost in reverie when there appeared within the circle comprised in his rolling gaze a man with a rubicund face who with a napkin around his body another under his arm and a white cap upon his head approached him holding paper pen and ink in hand				298.97225050660603
the other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of collicure wine these were the lackeys of these gentlemen				1951.9159275971451
one day it was the morning of the day my story begins the king louis xiv then ten years of age went in state under pretext of returning thanks for his recovery from the small pox to notre dame				1656.4826438465386
you have succeeded the prince is beaten since he can no longer fight				1158.5941796458917
the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence				14319.382471713156
the carriage started at a measured pace without betraying by the slightest sign that it contained people in a hurry				6686.265549165058
the man was wrapped up in a large cloak				1370.1340755443819
i will bless you i i am dying cried mordaunt come to me				115.99318692701064
well what have you to say				815.7661953028364
in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid ground were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the effect no doubt of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the country to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable				336107.186087713
now let me try on the dress of yonder chap				393056.3029687745
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction				2680.265231985116
i hoped your house would have been some other one than this as if there was not another house at auteuil than that of the assassination what what cried monte cristo stopping suddenly what words do you utter				364586.9915991853
comte de wardes not a word about the sapphire				192709.58437549428
as he passed the hôtel des gardes he took a glance into the stables				33912.357913152104
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides				10115.755537052197
how do i know				834.8626875830662
che cosa asked the bandit				8893.099603632154
totally disregarding the business of the stage he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman aided by a powerful opera glass but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own thoughts that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass				976.2702771980428
there was no time to lose				2839.14351285002
that s it said the duke now make me a little hole in the floor whilst i go and fetch the culprit la ramee knelt down and made a hole in the floor meanwhile the duke hung the crawfish up by a thread				433060.58957982087
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz				818.0363681877897
teresa uttered a cry of joy and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking luigi darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing room				198.82179940713388
oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that i see debray leave here pocketing the whole of the livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discovered that is a roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he loses the baroness became enraged				52240.19029321311
the poor girl promised all her lover desired she was mad				1561.3540080589078
a rich englishman continued the abbé who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value this jewel he bestowed on dantès upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement				8367.514128506806
let me see what time it is danglars watch one of breguet s repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous night struck half past five				6647.405625096562
at length they reached the tent lit a lamp and while planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised d artagnan with a trembling hand broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter				698.0137168888201
let things take their course perhaps you may not have to retract bah said albert staring				118446.27212345389
an officer approached				2849.024520665719
why does the boat go so fast asked i of my mother				1608.7535258227108
edmond listened and the sound became more and more distinct				325673.9977202415
but know you who he was he used to be the headsman of bethune you knew him				52.64778876685931
the rencontre				364389.5530409735
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still i found nothing nothing the chest was no longer there the chest no longer there murmured madame danglars choking with fear				1020.0029580003084
it is francs which i now owe you said monte cristo				104.12198303467659
i beg you to do so replied albert				176.88729718116383
i was at the house of monte cristo an hour since said morrel we were speaking he of the sorrow your family had experienced and i of your grief when a carriage rolled into the courtyard				8549.882255311155
she was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by inches				131386.19271899978
you would fight only by broad daylight warn your foe before an attack and never attempt anything by night lest you should be accused of taking advantage of the darkness athos smiled				617.9106809756191
at length he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash but the vehicle turned to one side leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome				2181.398038806152
liked a pleasant jest				5852.088418622393
yes indeed to you i succeeded in deciphering your name under the blood with which the letter was stained replied monte cristo amid the general outburst of amazement				1401.4986844699697
has the law a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall				39887.743953102094
you have permitted me to converse with you from time to time valentine but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere have i not obeyed				1555.5620540597738
oh no said he but help me to die if you can are you a priest asked raoul				613.5261157631672
and then resumed d artagnan to this decrepitude is probably added poverty for he must have neglected the little that he had and the dirty scoundrel grimaud more taciturn than ever and still more drunken than his master stay planchet it breaks my heart to merely think of it i fancy myself there and that i see him staggering and hear him stammering said planchet in a piteous tone but at all events we shall soon know the real state of things for i imagine that those lofty walls now turning ruby in the setting sun are the walls of blois probably and those steeples pointed and sculptured that we catch a glimpse of yonder are similar to those that i have heard described at chambord at this moment one of those heavy wagons drawn by bullocks which carry the wood cut in the fine forests of the country to the ports of the loire came out of a byroad full of ruts and turned on that which the two horsemen were following				13301.830910290317
so much the better duke so much the better said the king advancing toward the door				344.0227465677104
d artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of st leu and followed him instinctively				42112.58081084099
raoul at the same time seized one of the young man s hands and placed it on the mane which it grasped with the tenacity of a drowning man				230.02139823340946
at the same time the fever which for an instant abandoned her returned to give luster to her eyes color to her cheeks and vermillion to her lips				704.8360895056355
excellencies said he the coach is ready well then said franz let us to the colosseum by the porta del popolo or by the streets your excellencies by the streets morbleu by the streets cried franz				711.2433916457284
the last attack i had said he lasted but half an hour and after it i was hungry and got up without help now i can move neither my right arm nor leg and my head seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain				3026.2009072856613
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear				3660.638400402597
at length franz arrived at the word myself				767.751776041815
a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deep seated hatred of ideality these were the elements of private and public life displayed by m de villefort				568.8842827379142
they arrived thus screened by the lining of the trench till they came within a hundred paces of the bastion				3095.3575126070577
you are perhaps a tulip fancier my dear friend if i am you must not laugh at me for being so				542.5648208864343
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and i should run mad				1417.0667120871303
the anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer in spite of his efforts to suppress it terrified his sensitive inamorata				437142.37467648875
d artagnan was worn out with fatigue				5122.872150520245
look emmanuel then turning towards monte cristo count said he in the name of all that is dear to you i entreat you not to kill albert the unhappy youth has a mother you are right said monte cristo and i have none these words were uttered in a tone which made morrel shudder				4112.188249254578
there was no fear of her falling asleep				3216.5145660616613
bonacieux throwing herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands				571.8100512885392
debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with everyone else and without any particular privilege				81303.12025969275
mousqueton is propped against the door and here s the key bravo said aramis how did you manage it like everything else with money but it cost me dear how much asked athos				152.64999668258636
you knew the poor lad then continued caderousse				616.0125671247453
we anchored our vessel which had a double hold where our goods were concealed amidst a number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the rhône from beaucaire to arles				44766.96037093382
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world				685.240844514854
the patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution				6368.365058956447
well be on our side now resumed aramis				252.70185372365194
in a moment the door was opened and madame de morcerf alighted leaning on her son s arm				1149.662348174882
let go and clue up at this last command all the sails were lowered and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards				150592.2084550433
what do you mean by that you idiot asked d artagnan				5.653291461343387
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act				2299.3937751844346
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came				1430.0010398756433
my god grant that he may one day suffer what i suffer upon the gospel said d artagnan throwing himself down by the dying man i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to drink of it as you did i do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures				475802.30482658825
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire				23172.27110375285
it advanced rapidly along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled				85416.22641411505
but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out				426.6343301281657
on the cross i swear if i ever leave this place to call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race beware said the voice in a threatening accent that i had never yet heard				1412.88417006224
but do you happen to belong to him monsieur d artagnan replied athos is in the service he is a soldier and obeys all constitutional authority				8883.055152326797
yes yes this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of that royal bandit				5901.013813548121
she remained at the same spot standing mute and motionless				1632.0630591297104
the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the louvre				8411.238032638998
sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards marseilles at other times gazing on the sea and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus end her woes				340084.6787241463
it is already done he said brucine is no longer employed but a simple narcotic				238817.12463722666
he had fainted				1474.4643816134217
and who are you eh pardieu joannes the jeweller well and you said i offended the good god said la carconte with a horrid smile				483.1307694181839
to take spies and hang them to make hazardous expeditions upon the dyke or the sea to imagine wild plans and to execute them coolly such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short which were not only so long to the rochellais a prey to famine and anxiety but even to the cardinal who blockaded them so closely				10038.450868022279
as he gained the top of the rue guénegaud he saw two persons coming out of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him				83.29134853045352
at the sight of carlini cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand				321.038988833232
the man fell like an ox beneath the poleaxe				360987.43638372014
there is a certain fatality in it yes you are right d artagnan a fatality that will separate and ruin us				539.7132804111692
this time it was mordaunt who smiled				581.8906032119953
no my lord and i will set out at once				2308.3702327993196
on on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis i came here only to meet de chatillon i have met him i am contented tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul				962.8883062716918
i did not even wish to know her name nor do i know it just then a piercing cry ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the lady who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics				402685.6233745861
feverish and excited i rang at the door				339.7267742163989
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it fernand because you are the son of my father s brother because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse				5447.868226485583
de chevreuse was at tours				30111.835177615616
what is that again he asked				852.5768562643506
valentine entered at this moment and the formalities were resumed				295341.6609346961
the other members silently dispersed				305549.063808225
but at the same time the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it				88.90906935568297
i am getting more and more seasick go in then grimaud said mousqueton handing him the beer pot and gimlet				305982.3826985206
alas said valentine restraining her tears my grandfather is dead m				676.5690626939916
heigho said porthos opening his large eyes what have you got to say that his eminence has ordered you to england and that monsieur d artagnan is waiting for you in the stables porthos sighed heavily arose took his hat his pistols and his cloak and departed casting a look of regret upon the couch where he had hoped to sleep so well				633.011787864417
i say why is the king taken prisoner				1203.0475245396226
he wished to hasten their steps but athos took his arm and passed it under his own and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend				830.0188583849681
there they found a brig ready to set sail upon the deck of which they recognized mordaunt walking up and down impatiently				7945.522534840589
how old is she inquired the vicomte de bragelonne				5150.908602477156
we never joke replied peppino solemn as a quaker				333123.807148396
i tell you sir that two persons exist in you the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his office the eyes of noirtier glistened and d avrigny approached				2748.5793430571316
but as you are the strongest after all continued d artagnan don t be furious with old men and women and keep your wrath for more appropriate occasions the people listened to these words and let go the ladies who thanked d artagnan with an eloquent look				988.6377371039401
this time i too saw them said porthos				16.40556773605703
there s luck my lord				562.8732910689338
can i have lost it				79.70483354642622
whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody else				4703.034110138871
i am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you mademoiselle solemnly assuring you that i wish your life may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no place for me even in your memory oh murmured valentine				796.2567045792769
chapter viii				8813.49799272863
he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised winter s head and unfastening the order of the saint esprit placed it on his own breast				1544.5948147459164
do not detain those gentlemen here count she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the garden rather than suffocate here since they are not playing ah said a gallant old general who in had sung partant pour la syrie we will not go alone to the garden then said mercédès i will lead the way turning towards monte cristo she added count will you oblige me with your arm the count almost staggered at these simple words then he fixed his eyes on mercédès				1485.5044822305358
yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbé s gaze i can boast with truth of being an honest man and continued he significantly with a hand on his breast and shaking his head that is more than everyone can say nowadays so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the abbé for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good will be rewarded and the wicked punished such words as those belong to your profession answered caderousse and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter expression of countenance one is free to believe them or not as one pleases you are wrong to speak thus said the abbé and perhaps i may in my own person be able to prove to you how completely you are in error what mean you inquired caderousse with a look of surprise				1960.9360890184291
and why asked the old man				176.9368998390744
now what would you say to an ensign s commission in my guards and a company after the campaign ah monseigneur you accept it do you not monseigneur replied d artagnan with an embarrassed air				869.8029379222525
you never knew her eh madame who knows said athos				10.8494331559494
it is however impossible that this should end as they have decreed in fact as this last reflection indicated this instinctive return to hope sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent spirit				52115.19191696651
athos kissed the hem of the robe of the widowed queen and rising with a dignity that made a deep impression on those around i the comte de la fere a gentleman who has never deceived any human being swear before god and before this unhappy queen that all that was possible to save the king of england was done whilst we were on english ground				1548.10537079034
rochefort called him his friend his dear bonacieux and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him				79.99805754312901
after which your majesty will i think no longer doubt my zeal in your behalf the queen bit her lips and moved impatiently on her chair				1046.0933829367207
devil take him then he said aloud the queen my lord				562.9589168303538
your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here perhaps he even suspects the person				1346.0046612072733
and you go into that house cried he briskly				130747.96793626592
i love that humiliation i who am master of the universe as was augustus but where are you really going to sea viscount you know i am a sailor				3375.4334416522693
i only wish he would let me take his place shall we not set forth asked the sweet silvery voice of mercédès two o clock has just struck and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour to be sure to be sure cried dantès eagerly quitting the table let us go directly his words were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers				555941.4990826513
oh no said porthos it does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres				2026.865705805176
go and see cocles and if my father is there announce this gentleman it will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the englishman				1453.3724466480346
you know not then anything of your birth you have never seen your mother yes my lord she came three times whilst i was a child to my nurse s house i remember the last time she came as well as if it were to day you have a good memory said mazarin				481.9099462956712
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them				141.26571009514663
but as if the multitude had waited only for this demonstration to burst out all the sentiments of hostility that possessed it exploded simultaneously				69650.2314669956

after which the cardinal who had been informed that d artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him took leave of the king inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke				333970.8951216708
could not contain himself and he made a step toward the queen s apartment with that pale and mute indignation which when it broke out led this prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty				360685.986664376
and very princely added château renaud				971.2402805739647
besides here is a piquant fricandeau and a fillet of beef i am recruiting myself said porthos i am recruiting myself				589.0221241187435
the next minute franz heard himself called by albert who made the lofty building re echo with the sound of his friend s name				967.7647518040113
p s do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house				372.63022945605667

at this instant m de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume				3722.7415530731023
i believe that this singular man who appears to fathom the motives of everyone has purposely arranged for me to meet m and madame de villefort and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of our love my good friend said valentine i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your reason if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this				1287.7787257837615
ah heavens if it were that				644.5962262705414
the ballet was called poliska				586623.1331814551
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called out				417.60574439367934
and did you go alone asked morrel after he had read it				83.00793889783498
at last d artagnan having got up too close stepped back to prepare a fourth thrust but the moment when after a fine quick feint he was attacking as sharply as lightning the wall seemed to give way mordaunt disappeared through the opening and d artagnan s blade caught between the panels shivered like a sword of glass				974.5094010536425
and now that you have all you want and that we understand each other jump down from the tilbury and disappear not at all my good friend how				3439.238539587379
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing				2673.3292978233567
he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips				722.6278253635587
it is an axiom of criminal law and consequently you understand its full application sir continued villefort there is something to fear besides death old age and madness				7255.1667320470615
lying dressed upon his bed the noise awoke him with a start and found a gloomy echo in his heart				425.0095442246279
i now repeat that i was born at auteuil on the night of the of september and that i am the son of the procureur m de villefort				532.747999176477
alas my friends replied m morrel with a mournful shake of his head the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected oh indeed indeed sir he is innocent sobbed forth mercédès				1432.0829625859053
five minutes after the door had been closed on morrel s entrance it was again opened for the count				296.8570340661654
then some words were spoken by the two women				2454.106812818631
by the way added he in a low tone take care to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes the doctor without shaking hands with villefort without adding a word to what he had said went out amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household				14203.111713979455
in an instant they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek the boat grounded on the fine sand				41681.21967023628
we should look like the two sons of aymon who had lost their brother				1523.687851058288
yes said athos magnificent				45308.268028925806
still more must be done				1660.9538164068783
speak the young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him				90.6792459667523
let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two musketeers and return to athos				273.39941393500675
but i will take the left hand it is my custom in such circumstances				1784.3555481137541
notwithstanding all the pains he took d artagnan was unable to learn any more concerning his three new made friends				590.3746479192663
if we were not forced to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with us we should never dream of dining at home i assure you well take another glass of sherry and another biscuit willingly				9934.129552105078
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days to get married yes first and then to go to paris very good have what time you require dantès				444.46100180431057
sir he thus addressed d artagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron oliver cromwell these words struck d artagnan like a thunderbolt				57078.49871212138
no she replied it is for my poor grandmother				13895.932679558813
on the following morning at five o clock d artagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mother s recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor d artagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow				2094.1590204795816
i will wear it i swear to you as a grateful man should do tis well arise vicomte embrace me raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count s arms				528.3392911286139
he continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve la rochelle				3869.104744624401
why do you stop here asked d épinay				26435.187147228953
the curtain rose and the attention of franz was attracted by the actors and his eyes turned from the box containing the greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the stage				3339.199177405181
when i say i want i mean the queen wants them				114.52424558695824
you have no idea my friend how my bones ache since i came here				852.8838494672563
d artagnan however could only see enough to recognize the form of her vestments not enough to distinguish her features				15154.067340350719
almost immediately bertuccio entered the apartment				753.6064636781421
in what am i benefited by accompanying my son so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa				16335.026900337205
cæsar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends that is to say in the first place the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard				76625.7792445759
at the same minute one of the little windows of the hôtel de ville was thrown open and the head of a gendarme appeared				922.6047223066787
valentine said a low voice				536.8780067008374
communication being closed by the war i was in want of everything				1071.8627494870539
you know well that i don t like to leave things half finished conclude then sir answered de chatillon with as much hauteur as aramis				177.38868688428607
d artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat				2316.521087206192
before questioning me he said reply to my question				1359.4988342056631
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure				19200.926533059715
grimaud finding that his master had been arrested fell back into the ranks near aramis without saying a word and as if nothing had happened				2671.372009834319
the president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes				392.30129835657004
anne ascended the steps side of the bed and softly kissed the placid forehead of her son then she retired as silently as she had come merely saying to laporte try my dear laporte to make the king more courteous to monsieur le cardinal to whom both he and i are under such important obligations chapter v the gascon and the italian				5057.696878322724
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar				461984.8037568305
oh my mother it was you who said you were free you had a beloved father you were destined to be almost a queen				474.8917537271731
you know that it was in leaving his house that m de caderousse was murdered by his friend benedetto				7523.243494940466
now at the moment when i left his house here aramis paused				3010.0536241383857
the only time i have worn these studs was at a ball given by the king eight days ago at windsor				320604.4043299309
now for the tally ho athos threw himself into d artagnan s arms				536.4301876512112
he was no				585.493801863093
but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased athos had not a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles				1869.9511086354119
hello here is my watch				2032.829943636806
who is that man he asked				912.5372135312575
it struck ten				8721.349320042513
i must first tell you that monsieur de rochefort is planchet hesitated				4509.340077054506
the army marched silently the prince at the head of the column				35424.59218515343
did you really think me capable of that at least said the abbé i now see how wrong such an opinion would have been				5102.963229705975
the valet de chambre announced m de villefort at the moment when the count leaning over a large table was tracing on a map the route from st petersburg to china				87399.96158130077
milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kitty s in bringing it but at the first words she read she became livid				5781.929630590879
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment				61619.240022493665
nay it must have been a promise a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh let them answered d artagnan				52.28147756466389
oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle andrea bit his lips				673.7144898200432
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule				3548.222189467178
monsieur d artagnan is not with me he serves under monsieur dessessart well then take him said the cardinal when four men are so much attached to one another it is only fair that they should serve in the same company that same evening m de tréville announced this good news to the three musketeers and d artagnan inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning				656.5955162265682
the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying visits and conversing				234446.92586752985
come come fernand said caderousse hold up your head and answer us				437.12294772204774
the king cried out several voices deceived by the blue ribbon and chestnut horse of winter take him alive no				578.2392646783492
now then let us breakfast with what an air he says all this muttered beauchamp decidedly he is a great man a great man in his own country added debray				1007.7076802586297
have you kept him in the cellar all this time merciful heaven				840.8254264650674
if he demands my daughter let him fix the day declare his conditions in short let us either understand each other or quarrel				11487.14386986729
what is to happen said porthos				13.683515552532047
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses				1815.9681623322692
this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a word				647.0697351818227
aramis dipped a cloth into some water and applied it to the gash				226446.7382788266
will you let me be killed				2136.9049604407137
listen to me he said or rather look upon me look at my face paler even than usual and my eyes red with weariness for four days i have not closed them for i have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for maximilian the blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of valentine for the name just announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her				214.54055802265017
do you not know the race said he				10.91457496303229
oh my god my god cried milady when i supplicate thee to pour upon this man the chastisement which is his due thou knowest it is not my own vengeance i pursue but the deliverance of a whole nation that i implore do you know him then asked felton				658.9510307552639
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eye glass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a half official air without smiling or speaking				2775.9971554601852
exactly and you have that letter of the cardinal said d artagnan				6.070294207583397
edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a feeling almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his eyes he saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will o the wisps that play about the marshes				44132.59563494837
only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues the two young men looked at morcerf as if to say are you mad or are you laughing at us and i also said morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon ah cried albert it is very lucky that m morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth my dear albert said debray what you tell us is so extraordinary ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of them they have no time				293.37560161381487
this sir is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is as dantès spoke villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance and recollected the words of renée who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him				72.52457959462339
on reaching home d artagnan found kitty waiting for him				81.36605783846352
do not charge a fee for access to viewing displaying performing copying or distributing any project gutenberg™ works unless you comply with paragraph e or e				1488.2759800670074

it is a rich study for you who as i learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map yes sir replied the count i have sought to make of the human race taken in the mass what you practice every day on individuals a physiological study				3553.660813788934
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod				300751.15294847806
for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four days that he had been carrying out his purpose edmond had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter with him and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously at him but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last moments				12214.690779811877
the young man looked bowed in obedience and then went to teresa and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the count s daughter				1653.323800049758
we need not say which portion of the garden was her favorite walk				6974.857237037645
she revives cried the young man				193.0601732467654
she moved with the light free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian				144489.53645349058
in italy asked the king eagerly				3393.634641626817
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran s morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear				1017.922423672654
well it has happened to me to do so in our blaisois forests and i remember that the first time i encountered one with its eyes fixed upon me curled up swinging its head and pointing its tongue i remained fixed pale and as though fascinated until the moment when the comte de la fere your father asked de guiche				1727.7554194189445
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water				1889.8754830655403
noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary				2902.7433746301144
oh very simply black trousers patent leather boots white waistcoat either a black or blue coat and a long cravat				289931.0166863424
aramis smiled as one who hopes				13459.732551859193
on leaving these ladies he found himself with danglars who had advanced to meet him				77.12562757860402
i supplicate you i implore you on my knees let me die and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my preserver hearing that voice so sweet and suppliant seeing that look so timid and downcast felton reproached himself				322.7477971256338
what do you want monsieur demanded the musketeer recoiling a step and with a foreign accent which proved to d artagnan that he was deceived in one of his conjectures				373578.7033374769
your pardon sir said milady with mildness				59076.44276847303
well i will go to england a second time i will go and find buckingham you shall not do that d artagnan said athos coolly				16386.297472950362
you had begun to pervert my poor felton				745.2689892095
well yes madame said the novice are we rivals the countenance of milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances mme				193.11053568510752
without doubt porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments for instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand he pulled it toward him so that d artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a movement of rotation explained by the persistency of porthos				339.9695284416743
oh if you refuse my advice what do you advise said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing				3029.154736255616
you don t think of holding out against a whole regiment do you said porthos				45.28124430802966
he bowed respectfully to the king who gave him a somewhat cavalier reception but a look from his mother reproved him for the hatred which from his infancy louis xiv				2604.1174098398656
now whither do you conduct me into my room first replied comminges the queen will ultimately decide your place of domicile athos followed comminges without saying a single word				627.2990722459401
so then sir said morrel you hold bills of mine yes and for a considerable sum what is the amount asked morrel with a voice he strove to render firm				9691.575661037788
one of us would suffice really my dear monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal your coolness startles me i should have thought on the contrary that it ought to have inspired you with confidence and bernouin do i not take him with me there is no room for him he will rejoin your eminence let us go said mazarin since everything must be done as you wish my lord there is time to draw back said d artagnan and your eminence is perfectly free not at all not at all said mazarin let us be off and so they descended the private stair mazarin leaning on the arm of d artagnan a hand the musketeer felt trembling				24059.023893033645
this embarrassment had completely escaped albert but it caused lucien to shorten his visit he was evidently ill at ease				4786.444633572073
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket				317924.7406649631
it will take a little longer time and may make a greater disturbance but you will be outside with swords and will rush in at the proper time but if you yourselves should be struck said athos				174.03218368523383
of the interval passed nothing remains in the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of trees mountains and landscapes are lost				1351.0459868848932
indeed does that alarm you no but it agitates me oh				682.8392152736856
adieu monsieur de rochefort he said				367.3227686293485
nothing makes the future look so bright as surveying it through a glass of chambertin that s all very well replied d artagnan but i am tired of fearing when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of milady you are very fastidious said athos such a beautiful woman a woman of mark said porthos with his loud laugh				2049.2201327842695
i am not surprised that you refused to recognize me				125.49810381502402
but do not despair you have life before you my dear albert for you are yet scarcely twenty two years old and as a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name take my father s it was herrera				415633.494387561
but raoul was not at the hotel du grand charlemagne				231775.65111900086
now then to play another master stroke by which i shall gain the heart of both husband and wife delightful				7143.305697914517
in the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal				52277.96760274296
she believed the order ready for execution				6323.604632116745
all we can now do is to wait				4587.215004571159
good heaven				729.3310907199477
speak said athos				10.48469877670596
this look told him all and his anger waxed hot				178891.00932781078
you have done well to warn me				81.5481479966676
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge				30132.259805821916
count she said bragelonne must be a charming place				899.0675969935612

marshal de grammont put himself at the head of all the available cavalry and infantry and took the road to vendin leaving the duc de chatillon to await and bring on the rest				1564.8131125218822
the king and his escort were no longer there				984.7862213310216
from châlons to lyons you will go on by the steamboat				48370.52353384483
napoleon would doubtless have deprived villefort of his office had it not been for noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the girondin of and the senator of protected him who so lately had been his protector				26247.233104821153
my faith it was time that idea came into porthos s head				553.6702695883263
i swear to you sir should any harm befall me your name will be the last name that i shall utter the remembrance of you my last thought athos hastened upstairs to conceal his emotion and regained with hurried steps the porch where olivain was waiting with the horses				1767.1557255715932
as to the horse ride him a little every day and that will accustom you to his maneuvers oh make yourself easy on that head replied aramis				190.49976390081656

the order of imprisonment came from high authority and the order for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as napoleon has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the letters have not yet been forwarded but said morrel is there no way of expediting all these formalities of releasing him from arrest there has been no arrest how it is sometimes essential to government to cause a man s disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their wishes it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear morrel since the reign of louis xiv				2577.293376890879

but as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing rooms the brilliant sums the rolling millions which were to be at the command of the two young people and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young lady s diamonds which had been made in a room entirely appropriated for that purpose had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly				3072.0689678717163

he turned a spyglass toward the little group amongst which the king stood				39797.463433739795
did he allude to his hope of being captain he spoke of it as a thing already decided indeed said danglars he is in too much hurry it appears to me why it seems m morrel has promised him the thing so that he is quite elated about it why yes he is actually insolent over the matter has already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of money as though he were a banker which you refused most assuredly although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned but now m dantès has no longer any occasion for assistance he is about to become a captain pooh said danglars he is not one yet ma foi it will be as well if he is not answered caderousse for if he should be there will be really no speaking to him if we choose replied danglars he will remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he is what do you mean nothing i was speaking to myself				704.350267926628

no said monte cristo i told you i did not wish to be behind my time i dressed myself in the carriage and descended at the viscount s door the young men looked at each other they did not know if it was a comedy monte cristo was playing but every word he uttered had such an air of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false besides why should he tell a falsehood				37917.393110097364
in an instant he was among the branches and his keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion				9998.66622393034

you see said she when the lackey had gone out everything is ready				765.0222940042469
replied the count				186.58957148389712
then said d artagnan letting his arm fall with discouragement it is useless to struggle longer				9403.130915255715
when they did so they found the three lower rows of benches already occupied but being anxious not to be too conspicuous all with the exception of porthos who had a fancy to display his red doublet were quite satisfied with their places the more so as chance had brought them to the centre of their row so that they were exactly opposite the arm chair prepared for the royal prisoner				1289.0012866281672
d artagnan ejaculated athos				51.66634362308374
by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon but as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle				146354.2712233468

morrel disappeared down the avenue de marigny and monte cristo hastened to join bertuccio				2660.6832613155325
you are right duchess				2072.0414262794407
they immediately all three halted closed in and waited occupying the middle of the road				2686.8591216696645
but one of these balls launched by porthos herculean hand passed so close to d artagnan s face that he thought that if instead of passing near it had hit him his audience would have been probably lost as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before the king				561.4140223327921
he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his heart				439.9240995451469
and that you should fail me d artagnan passed a very bad night				1167.6009708709453
your captivity shall be mild be assured and as every inconvenience deserves its indemnification here is in addition to the price of the studs an order for a thousand pistoles to make you forget the annoyance i cause you d artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this minister who thus open handed sported with men and millions				2698.238375075025

for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started but when out of sight he turned his horse to the right made a circuit and came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of the little troop				22508.416665920147
the damp had rendered it friable and dantès was able to break it off in small morsels it is true but at the end of half an hour he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two years supposing that the rock was not encountered a passage twenty feet long and two feet broad might be formed				7204.358871840511
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m andrea cavalcanti				3020.523685403532

as for you viscount continued monte cristo to morcerf you are more fortunate than the government for your arms are really beautiful and speak to the imagination				3101.710744077158
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world				709.7797833938196
alas said felton i can do but one thing which is to pity you if you prove to me you are a victim				70155.27923732586

after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath				7639.8081997418785
or rather to observe the chronological order i and d artagnan replied athos				26.03017294151445
he was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding franz smiled for he well remembered that albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion				16543.348474265862

if he had not courage he had what is very like it namely pride				2901.9434543177354
it will then be said of me that i died for the king so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing				581.1081177518743
my mother gave it to me and i fool as i was instead of keeping the ring as a holy relic gave it to this wretch then my friend take back this ring to which i see you attach much value i take back the ring after it has passed through the hands of that infamous creature				49139.933454408754

she cried out but d avrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left				1506.7149567833305
a long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his shoulders disclosing in front the splendid baldric from which was suspended a gigantic rapier				242608.9487103229
in this case milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot				1774.3454383301555

yes the rolling of a carriage it is the one my brother sends for us oh my god come come				1262.4012145288618
as soon as the identity of my brother was proved i was set at liberty				1641.2493410750185
why not sir asked charles				11080.219334925843
well albert said franz do you feel much inclined to join the revels				237639.3628915067
unfortunately however morrel had not only engagements with the house of thomson french who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in business he had correspondents and not friends				574.5237140786561
have you observed said he to them what a blood red color the moon has to night no replied athos i thought it looked much the same as usual look again chevalier returned lord winter				936.6752662459983

yesterday he wrote again but it was his servant who this time put the letter in the post do you say the procurator s wife is old and ugly fifty at least monsieur and not at all handsome according to pathaud s account in that case you may be quite at ease she will soon be softened				523707.0910334601

bonacieux with some embarrassment the cause of this event he attributed it i believe to a political cause i doubted from the first and now i think entirely as he does				3358.00550843366
very true replied the gascon but i always run away from compliments				13193.633746696594
love pardon for what asked she				63.13796943229582

i crossed the street and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the wall and by means of which i had once before looked into the garden				1387.6392374409563
behind the head of the bed and concealed by a stone fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty feet in length				7986.957562222449
another had done all this why then was it impossible to dantès				730.3800296045349
and if you wish ever to leave my palace you can not so make the best of it				97.59569999874599
you are born to good fortune said franz as he returned the letter				730.1188720526341
you understand this do you not my most precious wife				1047.8267072003846
i m certain of it were it not for that i should thank you for you have worked for us				489.5297349530143
he was incessantly attacked by them and the superior to whom he had confided this misfortune wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them had advised him in order to conjure away the tempting demon to have recourse to the bell rope and ring with all his might				4902.139329596021
he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow				190926.37723504473
he then seemed more easy				1641.2869067211632
which was the real delinquent both sir one with a letter and the other put it in the post and where was this letter written at la réserve the day before the betrothal feast twas so then twas so then murmured the abbé				1139.8396610567027
remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe and think that what you are about to do is for his sake yes yes everything for him				74.11067879135285
i had a bad opinion of him the moment i saw his wound and since he asked for a monk you know that it was his opinion too that death would follow at the mention of the monk grimaud became pale				698.0103885079841
come hither and let us talk the host approached with hesitation				3077.4703161995094
the servant entered just as he had finished				74845.17729509837
in about ten minutes d artagnan appeared at the door followed by the inseparable porthos				364.80624564250877
well resumed the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of caderousse s reason vanishing before the last glass of wine				1176.2727472610309
certainly as he had himself owned the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful fellow				3323.97699917224
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere				11120.13893102165
monsieur laporte said d artagnan go and announce to the people through the grating that they are going to be satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see the king but they shall see him in bed add that the king sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence so as not to awaken him but not every one a deputation of two or four people every one madame but reflect they will keep us here till daybreak it shall take but a quarter of an hour i answer for everything madame believe me i know the people they are like a great child who only wants humoring				411789.8529782493
he came there and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba the projected landing etc				230339.3908265802
guard her				230.12583991507935
the general was there surrounded by the more prominent chiefs				250124.53251551744
her husband who when he married her had no other patrimony than his noble probity his first rate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his wife				1141.297220167749
perceiving m de tréville at a distance come here monsieur captain said he come here that i may growl at you				197.5498020884751
now in seconds very many things can be done and how shall i know whether your excellency has succeeded or not oh that is very easily arranged				11596.233554567754
this point settled the duke turned to d artagnan				63.250185753820105
in fact at that moment a second neighing was borne to them on the night wind				3365.777211225939
they wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees before their sovereign and that they might move her to compassion but they were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her way haughtily disdainful of their entreaties				289397.0349784181
the steamer soon disappeared and in an hour afterwards as the count had said was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night				1172.4564822470845
but come resumed the englishman are these men of yours dangerous in what respect are they capable of attempting violence d artagnan burst out laughing at the idea				2908.3711831900514
if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable				30895.491769344993
sir replied comminges it seems that it is impossible monsieur de comminges said athos i have been a soldier all my life and i know the force of orders but outside your orders there is a service you can render me i will do it with all my heart said comminges for i know who you are and what service you once performed for her majesty i know too how dear to you is the young man who came so valiantly to my aid when that old rogue of a broussel was arrested				2324.9523662325723
perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the musketeer				2124.8542532045144
as i look at it a millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio				366531.6145775014
a dull and heavy sound was heard and the man dropped like an ox on his face and then turned over on his back				1338.998185412345
do you think so				292.04767985435757
what have i done then				604.1617574037012
what is the matter barrois said valentine				152.94070201056942
the hand of god chapter				293.9732702902063
where she was known as la belle provençale she was the widow of the marquis de castellane when she married de ganges and having the misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothers in law was forced by them to take poison and they finished her off with pistol and dagger ed				6964.660924588062
at the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the landing place their eyes fixed on the boat evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions				7550.031269935116
who goes there cried the same voice impatiently whilst d artagnan perceived that they had rushed to the horses heads				2952.9024361801166
death to the guards				1315.9466017465472
silence and fatigue together overcame d artagnan and sleep overtook him also				1656.7701823811128
once only had villefort seen his father it was the day after that upon which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto when the latter was to learn his father s name				931.1359358999238
and you too said he come if you like monsieur you have a claim being almost one of the family and i will give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find persons willing to accept them cavalcanti looked at danglars with a stupefied air and the latter making an effort arose and stepped between the two young men				843.2429356974768
without your aid continued he repeating the count s words i should have been a dead man thrice dead my antagonist took flight replied de guiche and left me at liberty to come to your assistance				2794.000666293328
as to my orders since every one gives his own commands in our party i shall end if this goes on by giving none at all in short my lord said athos glancing at aramis your highness is discontented with your party discontented sir				380.0009018268032
he walked six or seven times round the place royale turning at every ten steps to look at the light in milady s apartment which was to be seen through the blinds				41448.576780416915
think what a figure you will make when you are asked how do they execute at rome and you reply i do not know and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son				735.3878621705708
i am your only daughter and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the porte saint martin and gaîté who disinherit their daughters for not giving them grandchildren				78483.01510002853
and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with d artagnan are you thirsty as thirsty as a scotchman was grimaud s laconic reply				630.590814542463
mother nanette cried friquet suffocating ah				174.16692048968812
yes that may be				904.4959391760752
i should never have thought of that said porthos and yet it is very simple come aramis said d artagnan write this for us in those neat little characters in which you wrote to marie michon that the mother of this gentleman intended to assassinate the duke of buckingham mordaunt sustained this new attack without wincing				487930.86311528366
oh he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head we will soon find out in what way why the fair is on at beaucaire there are always jewellers from paris there and i will show it to them				125.89632559197648
perhaps not being endowed with the endurance of athos who seemed to be made of iron he would have preferred a bath in the river seine of which he had heard so much and afterward his bed but the comte de la fere had spoken and he had no thought but to obey				9644.67238417143
now said he will you come i am ready milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window				724.2546733432
the noise of their retreating footsteps and the murmur of their voices soon died away				609.8969593519226
yes i heard this news and knew it even before you could for three days ago i posted from marseilles to paris with all possible speed half desperate at the enforced delay three days ago				5983.6608036606385
that admiration is on the contrary so great so real madame returned mazarin without noticing the change of language offered to him by the queen that if the king charles i whom heaven protect from evil came into france i would offer him my house my own house but alas				1234.7481523070346
no no returned monte cristo pale as death pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion				266933.48627142305
a fortnight afterward the duke going to the tennis court found two rows of trees about the size of his little finger planted by the roadside he asked what they were for and was told that they were to shade him from the sun on some future day				426.0699678917446
but in either case what is to be done said the young man				195.01231413763057
scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw everything as distinctly as by daylight				24694.92855640437
the general doubted my fidelity no but i wish to have a share in my revenge				5717.958914131863
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones				5088.200002128314
thank you parry when the moment arrived the king followed his guards out of the hall				7907.846180945506
the two friends repaired to athos s and he faithful to his vow of not going out took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them				134.5776147854542
all his emotion then burst forth he cast himself on the ground weeping bitterly and asking himself what crime he had committed that he was thus punished				346475.88676803466
i know you are as brave and venturesome as any man in the world but you do not belong to me alone you belong to all our party				2647.0189104641845
he had written to the duc de beaufort to come and the duke was about to arrive and he would find paris tranquil				339816.8876127944
that is enough to drive away all my pains i could mount him with thirty balls in my body				1458.4361498256267
he had now leisure to look to his wound				3464.388589720159
i say we have been here eighty three hours tis your fault answered porthos				107.8417652485205
you can come and dine three times a week said mme				27.75218090649799
to morrow night we shall rescue you how can that be cried the king whose face was lighted up in spite of himself by a flash of joy				1949.9158490179655
i have distrusted god i could the more easily distrust you				190.0908901455127
where were we i recollect you were saying said d artagnan that after having demanded my head of the cardinal milady had quit the shores of france				792.8306071162419
and how many men had he with him i do not know sire answered the minister of police				4068.7396493362935
to begin with tell me said she how have you watched me so closely as to be aware beforehand not only of my arrival but even of the day the hour and the port at which i should arrive lord de winter adopted the same tactics as milady thinking that as his sister in law employed them they must be the best				7208.626785578595
at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow				1098.0171423447553
milady knew she might be watched so she continued her prayers to the end and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her door did not march with the same step and seemed to listen				1691.8881380553323
in short up to this period nothing had been wanting to tréville but opportunity but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand				300.24059053583215
but when i have found them then tremble sir				343.36294366859613
then cæsar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the papers of the dead man				234.43930157747636
now it is revealed this secret so full of horror as the tragic poet says				8280.344260860284
i went to your house and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten o clock to breakfast				1919.4636973076097
we are going to return to the service mouston replied porthos still trying to restore his mustache to the military curl it had long lost				1338.4421812395833
where is thy master you stand upon his property but how handsome thou art how fat				75778.28802204887
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other				1029.982269883934
benedetto could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a day than others in a week				4065.4699110006686
what undertaking can have brought him to paris				431.6016150847014
you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can live				5190.693814361627
he had my love				1391.6873212089693
who would ever have thought it d artagnan only sighed				2857.1164720056086
he reeled back with a shudder and the same moment the drops became a crimson cataract				362264.8467340681
you see i have not these necessary papers fortunately i have them though said monte cristo				147.1259670872153
armed men shouldering muskets watched over the barricades with menacing looks words of command patrols arrests executions even were encountered at every step				2224.0669581373445
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates				9181.489146834512
sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies				32772.673144369684
for heaven s sake do not serve as a conductor between that man and me				124.98874650527584
what said kitty blushing				36133.099200563396
once under my grandfather s roof m morrel can visit me in the presence of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness in that case i shall expect m morrel to come and claim me at my own hands				481.30069205879175
the instant debray had touched the ground he was at the carriage door				366.5244136765786
this crisis past i endeavored to catch your eye but could not				703.3977408234124
there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver				4881.733275708538
well said he i will swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of despair				2054.16065759558
he was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud				51450.738186432136
speak comte de la fere my lord replied athos for myself i have nothing to demand				30671.729593297237
villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at one draught				83177.28972531029
i will stop at the first posting house said danglars to himself				302.05538352279785
well asked the president what is your decision i have no reply to make said the count in a low tone				794.1817776219011
the fact was in leaving notre dame the coadjutor had learned the event of the day				461.9045802928964
no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it				96.06969973928831
nevertheless d artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of this impertinent personage who ridiculed him				64.96834344974266
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation				363388.71418925497
dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous				15268.55317051226
d artagnan took off his hat and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak				1316.1781667540124
under the oldest and thickest of these trees reclining on cushions sat my father my mother was at his feet and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the diamond hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle				17813.368037855707
i told you of it yesterday				5519.839848937193
fortune is precarious and if i were a woman and fate had made me a banker s wife whatever might be my confidence in my husband s good fortune still in speculation you know there is great risk				404319.9101671541
they can t be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night				1133.0983124371432
it was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of these reflections that the door of the chamber opened and the king entered				628.0988289488897
i know you gentlemen said the cardinal i know you				80.76420432796172
oh heavens exclaimed morrel i do not deceive myself that young man who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is albert de morcerf yes said monte cristo i recognized him how so you were looking the other way the count smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled woman who soon disappeared at the corner of the street				1556.7352026273977
when i think of you my heart beats fast the blood burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe but i solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of feeling until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you				155.20648823390266
s blood cried he to d artagnan do not kill him young man i beg of you				182.20196964906268
but the voyage was not ended				6458.604577981157
if we can not we will do without him				78.91870063637431
the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which the count could see into the dressing room				192.38482106331148
danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon				292994.1116787464
with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud				173000.94266361406
qui vive he asked				826.5081813308573
well sir at last said anne of austria you are silent after rendering such a service madame replied d artagnan i have nought to say save that my life is ever at your majesty s service and that i shall only be happy the day i lose it for you i know that sir i have known that said the queen a long time therefore i am delighted to be able thus publicly to mark my gratitude and my esteem permit me madame said d artagnan to reserve a portion for my friend like myself he laid an emphasis on these words an ancient musketeer of the company of tréville he has done wonders his name asked the queen				323.0454193769347
the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor				267907.7080267417
my fist is strong enough i swear cried porthos extending a hand like a shoulder of mutton				263606.07113788126
my friend my father said morrel with excitement have a care i again repeat for the power you wield over me alarms me				106.53740369531663
well well cried d artagnan this reconciliation is truly touching have you not tears in your eyes porthos yes said porthos but i do not know if it is feeling or the wind that makes me weep i think it is the wind now climb up athos quickly said d artagnan				36.71191102552832
the position in which he had left him was critical				206273.7517151268
is she your daughter no mademoiselle said monte cristo astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question				1979.2356671940918
d artagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast				1560.9326713484984
he ran up the steps entered the church and addressing a verger who was sweeping the chapel asked him if he knew monsieur bazin				2972.48127308984
aramis went off at once begging athos not to remain alone within reach of d artagnan and porthos a piece of advice which was received with a contemptuous smile				560.0290316248985
oh god thou hast preserved my memory i thank thee i thank thee at this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall the guide was coming monte cristo went to meet him				83.0615492415606
the queen is too virtuous and besides loves your majesty too well woman is weak monsieur cardinal said the king and as to loving me much i have my own opinion as to that love i not the less maintain said the cardinal that the duke of buckingham came to paris for a project wholly political and i am sure that he came for quite another purpose monsieur cardinal but if the queen be guilty let her tremble indeed said the cardinal whatever repugnance i may have to directing my mind to such a treason your majesty compels me to think of it				69.62545317767182
end of the port wine mystery				3563.0404633996777
monte cristo advanced towards her and extended his hand which she as usual raised to her lips				698.737683790873

stop and let us talk talking with you brings me misfortune said porthos				38.48825744270262

anne de bueil murmured the wounded man				222.425354597544
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my mind and you albert i replied the viscount i saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that day for i had quitted college the same morning and we had passed the previous night at a tavern besides it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see one anywhere else when you travel it is to see everything				932.6089605173966

but still if albert be not so rich as mademoiselle danglars said the count you must allow that he has a fine name so he has but i like mine as well certainly your name is popular and does honor to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon twenty years and for this very reason said danglars with a smile which he tried to make sardonic i prefer m andrea cavalcanti to m albert de morcerf still i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the cavalcanti the morcerfs stay my dear count said danglars you are a man of the world are you not i think so and you understand heraldry a little well look at my coat of arms it is worth more than morcerf s why so because though i am not a baron by birth my real name is at least danglars well what then while his name is not morcerf how not morcerf not the least in the world go on i have been made a baron so that i actually am one he made himself a count so that he is not one at all impossible listen my dear count m de morcerf has been my friend or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty years				1048.2664850472245

here he is d artagnan walking and soliloquizing had arrived within a few steps of the hôtel d arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived aramis chatting gaily with three gentlemen but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that m de tréville had been so angry in the morning and as a witness of the rebuke the musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable he pretended not to see him				81.03856216478957
you have only to wait here till i release you d artagnan was known to this valet de chambre who was no other than bernouin and he had during the last six or eight months introduced the gascon a dozen times to the cardinal				292.97466446166453

yes and who is it said porthos				16.50747745741341
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served franz looked repeatedly at albert in order to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the events which franz knew of had had their effect on him alone he remarked that his companion did not pay the least regard to them but on the contrary ate like a man who for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of italian cookery that is the worst in the world				690.656749502694
justice is done said porthos wiping his forehead				1448.3622371598346

i follow you though i am not hungry come if one can t always eat one can always drink a maxim of poor athos the truth of which i have discovered since i began to be lonely d artagnan who as a gascon was inclined to sobriety seemed not so sure as his friend of the truth of athos s maxim but he did his best to keep up with his host				1089.1876558626236

the noise was caused by porthos who had just knocked down his man				232.19664700861887

one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement				348732.4071527913

then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his francs and the other livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon				2175.1503703689136

well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention				2111.0950287771875

but by degrees watch chains necklaces parti colored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and gaspard caderousse unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and wife although a bitter feeling of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded				326125.9043563677
how could i pronounce that word				501.73444408965094
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed boats and the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed the count of monte cristo wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory				5512.7641337185805
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love				1592.5225246526506
well resumed mme				95.33262510929636

luigi vampa if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my hands by seven o clock the count albert will have ceased to live this second signature explained everything to franz who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment the street was safer for him				82.6913004789093
villefort and madame danglars remained for a moment as if rooted to their seats they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances				5777.696369305549
i think so indeed				1375.9151488355349

he drew his sword entirely from the scabbard and followed him crying turn turn master joker lest i strike you behind strike me said the other turning on his heels and surveying the young man with as much astonishment as contempt				3918.305668079038
without that precaution valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured				180350.818634347
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there				949.9664952842695
at the end of the breakfast franz took out his watch				2073.129528886408
if on the contrary i die remember maximilian my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate man				216.95504589126494
the past the count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left mercédès probably never to behold her again				431.19164317177155
i know it will end in that way but it is not they who taunt me with the most wounding reproaches but i understand you mean to allude to the recollections perpetually revived by these three gentlemen				1808.8374839628582
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetano s description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself				381.1089124151441
what design can i have why then not let me out by the door what would be the advantage of waking the porter ah reverend sir tell me do you wish me dead i wish what god wills but swear that you will not strike me as i go down cowardly fool what do you intend doing with me i ask you what can i do				977.436174249729

unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg e				1491.7054797303595

nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner				3902.3001552074293
that s a snare said athos don t go d artagnan and yet replied d artagnan i think i recognize the writing it may be counterfeit said athos				118.54497169387118
a friend maximilian and who is this friend				797.3904904058445
to be imprisoned				466882.9960580634
no sire replied athos				10.065612851369801
it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished opening				14687.013296905061
i can never forgive myself monsieur said louis xviii i command you to speak well sire the usurper left elba on the february and landed on the of march and where				9346.626613776214
d artagnan although he was not a musketeer performed the duty of one with remarkable punctuality				5379.435419147211
i can not swim and dared not throw myself into the river				4824.067994011132
but the prince de marsillac				367553.37776341377
undoubtedly madame said d artagnan taking the document and bowing this is a noble reward but everything in the world is unstable and the man who happened to fall into disgrace with your majesty might lose this office to morrow what more do you want asked the queen coloring as she found that she had to deal with a mind as subtle as her own				716.6354819599824
yes yes war said anne of austria				3077.3969444641707
you have been to yanina said he				13.084611983646418
an hour had nearly passed during which valentine breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over morrel				788.3907774550661
everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen but both of them had spoken so low that everybody out of respect withdrew several steps so that nobody had heard anything				1823.547757325168
be satisfied said d artagnan laughing porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess coquenard oh monsieur procurator s wife or duchess if she will but loosen her pursestrings it will be all the same but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier and did you convey this answer to your guest we took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission so that he still expects his money oh lord yes monsieur				1244.0776044955942
do not think i wish to turn you out my dear debray continued danglars oh no not at all				606.5020861486929
the world is not wanting in attractions				253894.35599655082
will you see the register at once asked the governor or proceed to the other cell let us visit them all said the inspector				1467.7904342056663
the doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will be here laporte said the queen suppose you put one of your sons in the king s place we might be off during the time if your majesty desires it said laporte my sons like myself are at the queen s service not at all said d artagnan should one of them know his majesty and discover but a substitute all would be lost you are right sir always right said anne of austria				4130.846706106739
and why is it impossible because monsieur de beaufort is one of my friends or rather i am one of his				1584.7942051622094
to reach england athos lowered his voice all france covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal must be crossed				15251.467856265823
the bustle which had been observed by henrietta maria and for which she had vainly sought to discover a reason was occasioned by the battle of lens announced by the prince s messenger the duc de chatillon who had taken such a noble part in the engagement he was besides charged to hang five and twenty flags taken from the lorraine party as well as from the spaniards upon the arches of notre dame				1633.6981571056874
as the door opened the sound of a guzla reached the ears of the young men but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter				2073.3005542589076
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity				19119.868606067117
then d artagnan who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel endeavored to turn the conversation but he could not succeed				5731.7827723279015
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort i promise on my honor then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into execution and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work at least a year and shall we begin at once at once we have lost a year to no purpose cried dantès				581.6739417827956
mazarin looked at her and whilst she deemed herself alone and freed from the world of enemies who sought to spy into her secret thoughts he read her thoughts in her countenance as one sees in a transparent lake clouds pass reflections like thoughts of the heavens				1597.8729285765776
truth compelled franz in spite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count to confess that the advantage was not on pastrini s side				1523.8774926659744
he therefore found d artagnan alone and as it was nearly eight o clock he took the young man with him				85.31331575805679
do you see whispered aramis to athos touching his shoulder with one hand and pointing with the other to the arms which the gascon wore under his belt				49798.85451529828
she dreamed don carlos had returned to spain she believes in dreams				3160.0102046288534
oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me i am yet living and extending his hand towards the table he seized a knife				2389.289626385642
were you a party man				177.38707976673658
but this year continued the horticulturist i ll take care it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch when the strawberries are ripe monte cristo had seen enough				1165.707312315877
have you really committed the crimes of which you are accused the count looked around him with an expression which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges				23198.42873662476
and the scotch they kept their word and never stirred said mordaunt				955.8211009422683
you did not see her				178.94789756521556
i shall replied d artagnan and instantly in truth my young friend you will act rightly said the gentleman pressing the gascon s hand with an affection almost paternal and god grant that this woman who has scarcely entered into your life may not leave a terrible trace in it and athos bowed to d artagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts				970.3177139712811
she then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of genius receive in great crises in supreme moments which are to decide their fortunes or their lives				32653.68517615366
coquenard had seen everything				869.9530919600269
in france he cried the usurper in france				787.7620906435034
danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of twenty				6751.7908308038695
it was about eleven o clock at night				1104.77838343292
they conducted me to the chatelet where i slept soundly being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free				4841.540395387719
ask d artagnan to london gentlemen said d artagnan				5.904832840100288
arrived here only yesterday morning and married today at three o clock				1079.6736522878043

what matters really not only to me but to officers of justice and the king is that an innocent man should languish in prison the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners you are very humble today remarked the governor you are not so always the other day for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey it is true sir and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad and you are not so any longer no captivity has subdued me i have been here so long so long when were you arrested then asked the inspector				1503.5549060722985

what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it but when will that be when i am your wife the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day				431.0740513200146

had this been all it might not perhaps have greatly signified for when the lower classes alone complained the court of france separated as it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and the bourgeoisie seldom listened to their voice but unluckily mazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold no less than twelve appointments in the court of requests at a high price and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their places and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily lower the value of each place the old functionaries formed a union amongst themselves and enraged swore on the bible not to allow of this addition to their number but to resist all the persecutions which might ensue and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by this resistance to combine to indemnify him for his loss				6081.385940845128
the servants had just disappeared under the trees followed by the tutor and the young men were laughing and talking about a hundred yards off				1218.6875563160922

when all had gone out and the door was closed m de tréville on turning round found himself alone with the young man				238.69300819388917
but after the searching look of the king he encountered the burning eyes of aramis				408.9464167066099
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one blood washes out shame poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much she is so noble a woman pity albert also maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess				1652.498586625324

there were collected and piled up all albert s successive caprices hunting horns bass viols flutes a whole orchestra for albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencils for music had been succeeded by painting foils boxing gloves broadswords and single sticks for following the example of the fashionable young men of the time albert de morcerf cultivated with far more perseverance than music and drawing the three arts that complete a dandy s education i e fencing boxing and single stick and it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher				394470.5174929541

all that he had heard from these three different men comminges guitant and villequier confirmed him in his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one on his side except the queen and then anne of austria had so often deserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious				43574.40550892441
there is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves i do not accuse them sire but i leave your majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the convent des carmes yes you are right tréville you are right then upon seeing my musketeers they changed their minds and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred for your majesty can not be ignorant that the musketeers who belong to the king and nobody but the king are the natural enemies of the guardsmen who belong to the cardinal yes tréville yes said the king in a melancholy tone and it is very sad believe me to see thus two parties in france two heads to royalty				14909.424970755885
ah here is a private staircase said the count that is convenient				20825.40091700992

you are in a hurry captain danglars said edmond smiling i will say to you as mercédès said just now to caderousse do not give me a title which does not belong to me that may bring me bad luck your pardon replied danglars i merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of time the pharaon can not be under weigh again in less than three months we are always in a hurry to be happy m danglars for when we have suffered a long time we have great difficulty in believing in good fortune				934.5592390158856
my sister thanks you for your good and eternal remembrance				52243.57817175178
what does scandal signify to me				99.51637928550093
morbleu you must know something about it				75.82038844112272
but as to what had been done by porthos and d artagnan afterward they were as ignorant as all the inhabitants of the chateau				5698.872375240116
we shall meet soon i trust in paris where you shall have your revenge the duke as he spoke kissed his hand spurred his horse into a gallop and disappeared followed by his troop who were soon lost in distance and darkness				1738.6580090164018
then collecting all her remaining strength she forced herself to close her eyes but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this moment so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth				3251.9509372453153

yes sire interrupted aramis raising his voice bishop juxon the faithful knight of christ obedient to your majesty s wishes charles clasped his hands amazed and stupefied to find that these foreigners without other motive than that which their conscience imposed on them thus combated the will of a people and the destiny of a king				577.990613332646

that reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous woman				515.5107699583964
he watched the effect of this question on the old man				251.3127331754605
from his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught				16563.17621686172
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts				21134.801864423174
bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead and then followed them ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles i fortunately he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference				364320.7527632061

the prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for help				5749.838858354211
by the light of a lantern the coadjutor recognized planchet				1298.6812118362452

on their part the musketeers who had not much to do with the siege were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life				552.9990339404258
anne of austria was then twenty six or twenty seven years of age that is to say she was in the full splendor of her beauty				4103.855272637292
the duke ran to the rampart and perceived on the other side of the ditch three cavaliers with two riding horses				1902.8496996829153
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commenced by the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it				98.98027968814638

besides had he not begged of morcerf not to mention his father s name before haydée				2970.933886632451
porthos opened his mouth thinking it a good opportunity to put in a word in his turn d artagnan checked him by a glance from the corner of his eye				1506.3521793364912
i pass my life upon my legs aramis again presented himself at the bishop s				1139.6032552871031

everything he said proves me to be under the protection of some powerful person this sudden fortune the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me gold showered down upon me and the most splendid alliances about to be entered into				67669.6872886518

valentine and morrel were exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was heard at the door bell				2160.001239902608
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators madame replied danglars the horses were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four years old and they made me extremely uneasy on your account nonsense retorted the baroness you could not have entertained any alarm on the subject because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in paris				439.6009593877258
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted				266328.8104071999
she felt that a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair and dragged her away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity				9352.99311843249
come said d artagnan to himself i have got one more enemy and now said the queen addressing d artagnan what is to be done				1614.2362017384817
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared				1171.0155248094457
he was of middle height but his person was so admirably shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was proverbial among the musketeers				1353.4020513551154
luigi pushed the stone behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a traveller on horseback stopping a moment as if uncertain of his road and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes				243449.81261857867
he crossed the sea and brought back the set of ornaments to the great queen who was able to wear them on her shoulder on the appointed day and this very nearly ruined the minister				2661.1197342622654
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four men and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying				71646.50305686354
it is true that the indulgence of his foster mother encouraged him				77.38293876496205

as d artagnan had presumed on receiving his letter milady in a delirium of joy had told her servant everything and by way of recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the commission she had given kitty a purse				4650.50343664855

i feel if this continues said mme				25.876580631941582
these two men thus opposed in age and interests resembled two parts of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their point of union				15585.029512002011
very well done the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly twenty paces from him				86.69238983744658
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor				10609.55478782104
really said d artagnan abandoning the attempt to burst open the panel after several ineffectual attempts athos i can not imagine how you can talk to us in that way				644.5467420133698

he shut himself in his room and tried to read but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word and he threw away the book and for the second time sat down to sketch his plan the ladders and the fence				262331.8262439384
look at that wall without a single window which tells you fine things about mazarin s gratitude yes replied de comminges more especially if it could reveal how monsieur d artagnan for this last week has been anathematizing him poor d artagnan said athos with the charming melancholy that was one of the traits of his character so brave so good so terrible to the enemies of those he loves				28195.609105007017
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long				2204.1731291229576

do i not hear a carriage in the courtyard she opened noirtier s door ran to a window in the passage and returned hastily				8262.217395725163
for one second d artagnan thought the man had some evil design and he put his hand to his sword but in the movement made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was uncovered and d artagnan recognized the coadjutor				1655.1127818299
yes i received the news this evening by a courier				9154.577234014389

just so muttered comminges looking after mazarin				728.1635118279577
oh decidedly sir				351.68696302403515
caderousse drew a deep breath				8020.129550234966
the jailer was right dantès wanted but little of being utterly mad				1522.7770284652918

planchet had just done the same when an unexpected weight fell upon the back of the horse which sank down				1419.4072754422662
and do you comprehend grimaud said aramis				23.34831583796831
the count s well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice				5820.53517785086
the unknown waited for silence and then resumed i told you well that she would know me				64.51490892600597
again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve				320377.6164578175
the young men rode up to the wounded man to announce that they were followed by the priest				3205.670842325904

decidedly aramis said athos i think i was wrong not to let you fire hold your tongue replied aramis you would make me weep if such a thing were possible at this moment they were hailed by a voice from the sloop and a few seconds later men servants and baggage were aboard				270619.3846411432
they were standing motionless while single men passed from one group to another				767.3495457041976
the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands				543.2967015653559
it was almost a triumphal procession only behind the guards the barricades were closed again				486.4957680491729
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb				2826.784491401863
they had passed the tête de mort were now off the anse du pharo and about to double the battery				354677.10422529944

and you killed her the monk exclaimed				1567.4814183126573
philosophers may well say and practical men will always support the opinion that money mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoled you the king of finance the focus of immeasurable power danglars looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously				7335.439749469085
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected				1816.7320653668617
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk				5489.6434734366585
this event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of la rochelle which was determined he had sent monsieur to direct the first operations and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war				2190.050659048907
the king and the cardinal are the best of friends their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools				63385.15098676108
he took them with him without encouraging them or promising them anything and without concealing from them that their luck and even his own depended upon the cast of the dice				3301.388659883403
valentine repeated the same voice				543.668326461753
but d artagnan made a friendly sign to him with his head dismounted and throwing his bridle to a lackey who was passing he approached the valet de chambre with a smile on his lips				735.6607264619598
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night				1138.5240205538882
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door				347.61405097393987
morrel said not a word				480.8930396428172
a moment s silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow				1083.0727412636409
i embrace you				121.69564426757316
it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another story				1557.2118380797926
the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door				336.70612905987844

luigi slowly relinquished teresa s arm which he had held beneath his own and teresa accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille				330555.6898932756

i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed				11765.947801249695
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures				380592.10497107287
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you can all three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools				413867.81966612325
of what think you do young and strong men die in prison when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year unless it be of imprisonment caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his brow				1060.3035362833402
as for porthos on whom d artagnan had impressed the necessity of absolute silence and who did not even now begin to comprehend the scheme of his friend which was to follow mazarin in his visit to athos he was simply mute				55420.069210965106
singular bandits he exclaimed they have left me my purse and pocket book				166876.47637248208
ah said the marquise de saint méran a woman with a stern forbidding eye though still noble and distinguished in appearance despite her fifty years ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of terror would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our side since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch while they on the contrary made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the king for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our louis the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever will be to them their evil genius their napoleon the accursed am i not right villefort i beg your pardon madame				828.0592747498085
the two men remained opposite one another morrel trembling in every limb the stranger gazing at him with an air of profound pity				2614.5652026923135
there terminates at least to the present moment the duty i had to fulfill toward you the rest concerns another person and who is that other person asked milady warmly				5799.1481125111195
you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations				42783.509050387416
it was that of la carconte				3664.854532086532

milady was all attention				2079.940896359943
why you must have lost your senses whether i am in my senses or not answered franz that is the way i feel listen to me franz said albert i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the count while he on the other hand has always been courtesy itself to us				445.3520229259898
leave us alone then and you will enjoy a little amusement without cost to yourselves gentlemen said jussac it is with great regret that i pronounce the thing impossible				1771.6958232222685
and therefore my friends will conduct monsieur le cardinal neither to de beaufort nor to de bouillon nor to the coadjutor nor to d elbeuf				275993.1940028711
the count watched him				65.23963658704707
before she went to bed she had pondered analyzed turned on all sides examined on all points the words the steps the gestures the signs and even the silence of her interlocutors and of this profound skillful and anxious study the result was that felton everything considered appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors				46571.54282553749
not the first prince of the blood not the king s uncle but the base conspirator the soul of every cabal who pretends to lead the brave people who are weak enough to believe in the honor of a prince of the blood not the prince nearest to the throne not the king s uncle i repeat but the murderer of chalais of montmorency and of cinq mars who is playing now the same game he played long ago and who thinks that he will win the game because he has a new adversary instead of a man who threatened a man who smiles				56029.18990820715
i never caution my servants a second time remember that baptistin bowed and was proceeding towards the door				347.9020871923276

what do you say of him				72.26936192297876
take pity on me then and go				1295.6059007758035
mazarin still sombre and pensive permitted himself to be dragged along in this way it looked a race of phantoms				79542.4541915891
himself and the two young men represented the body of the army whilst olivain with his rifle upon his knee and his eyes upon the watch protected the rear				30549.79186204838
in the clover fields beyond the chestnut trees a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear morning song				43611.78018474068
well continued the count in a tone that made franz shudder this young gentleman is one of my friends this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself this young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger why did you not tell me all this you inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his look				1018.8717903375458
dantès observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind				467.6476331473896
he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different orders to which he belonged				5738.72912067238
you allow me to give you this title continued the count in french it is necessary to excite this man s confidence you can speak before me said franz i am a friend of the count s good returned peppino				2740.285142962521

she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter				2079.6483379707315
eight o clock found franz up and dressed while albert who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep				3210.011897441789
this hurt is just the fellow of the one i had on the road to amiens porthos turned around like a lion plunged on the dismounted cavalier who tried to draw his sword but before it was out of the scabbard porthos with the hilt of his had struck him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox beneath the butcher s knife				2392.7784354163914
during the six weeks that athos and aramis had been absent from france the parisians finding themselves one morning without either queen or king were greatly annoyed at being thus deserted and the absence of mazarin a thing so long desired did not compensate for that of the two august fugitives				55573.13018564914
a bottle perhaps a whole bottle				8948.142093422532
porthos did not feel the ridicule of this and took it for a piece of simplicity at which he laughed in his large mustache				82190.21495024968
is it possible to insult you madame said athos laughing he has insulted you and he shall die he shall die replied milady she first and he afterward athos was seized with a kind of vertigo				77805.59421596018
we will accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the garden of the little house in the allées de meilhan at marseilles				2248.2789768695006

meanwhile lord de winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of buckingham s household had all made their way into the chamber				857.3548474183947
nothing ambiguous if you please				5129.79476468733
all without had heard as we have said athos porthos and aramis called and had guessed from m de tréville s tone of voice that he was very angry about something				3257.140450687681
hate reproach the man that has spared my son s life				541.3422194648039
so if the second matter which you regret being unable to attend to is not more important than the first oh				987.6633226932342

well louis said anne why do you not kiss me i thought you were angry with me madame you sent me away i do not send you away but you have had the small pox and i am afraid that sitting up late may tire you you had no fears of my being tired when you ordered me to go to the palace to day to pass the odious decrees which have raised the people to rebellion sire interposed laporte in order to turn the subject to whom does your majesty wish me to give the candle to any one laporte the child said and then added in a loud voice to any one except mancini now mancini was a nephew of mazarin s and was as much hated by louis as the cardinal himself although placed near his person by the minister				2560.854755716928
what can he want with me he wishes to speak to you to me yes did he mention my name yes what sort of person is he why sir a man of about fifty short or tall about your own height sir dark or fair dark very dark with black eyes black hair black eyebrows and how dressed asked villefort quickly				1866.0238997957458
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented				152086.42845993134
we shall meet again in better days and whenever we find each other in whatever place it may be said kitty you will find me loving you as i love you today dicers oaths said athos while d artagnan went to conduct kitty downstairs				2081.3596441527516
the young girl no longer breathed no breath issued through the half closed teeth the white lips no longer quivered the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax				166343.39545310114
yes madame and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors and the blinds as he ceased speaking the count felt the hand of mercédès tremble				4467.7499668358905
the dead are everywhere said morrel did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris maximilian said the count you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some days at marseilles				2560.791258747529
it seems that he came to himself and that he will continue to be an annoyance see that now said porthos and i turned my horse aside from going plump on to him				56.50423471716931

before fifteen days are gone by i shall be away from here ah try it milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony				18017.57200536248
in a moment all the bandits were on their feet and twenty carbines were levelled at the count				282.93735844814887
it is horrible indeed but no one assassinates the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage and d avrigny prepared to speak				1340.2265534113644
peppino was decidedly an epicure				245910.18187410652
does this man know your majesty personally inquired aramis				35.033615067885925
no no i would rather die cried the queen in whom the imperious blood of spain and austria began to rise				5473.417031596369

what ails our friend said aramis he resembles one of dante s damned whose neck apollyon has dislocated and who are ever looking at their heels				210038.6508608337
do you think anything else was to be expected of them asked comminges who putting together what mazarin had said of his prisoners and what the comte de la fere had said began to feel a degree of uneasiness				1483.7863263724544
what do you say inquired charles rising				44071.946273630165
every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out monsieur de gondy				2964.6958442252076
mazarin turned the lock of a double door on the threshold of which they found athos ready to receive his illustrious guests according to the notice comminges had given him				78.58134353662759
you do not know the italian nobility the cavalcanti are all descended from princes have they any fortune an enormous one what do they do try to spend it all				589.0249328017977
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body				1484.496850991832

or rather who pretend not to understand me sir replied the prisoner with a smile of incredulity				16279.103296685538
d artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys he remained on horseback feeling no inclination to dismount and sat looking at the bars at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto only seen from the other side of the moat but by which he had for twenty years been awe struck				1396.3829536189955
in ten minutes after the strangers had departed franz was on the road to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by albert after the manner of pliny and calpurnius touching the iron pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators				81880.87336961529
while d artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors aramis had joined his companions so that on returning home d artagnan found the reunion complete				362440.39445560845

she had turned from the window which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her words were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her utterance				41578.47271888466
now shall i tell you something added athos coolly				9896.419298633138

d avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative				343886.1590140247

i have something to say to you certainly madame said porthos winking to himself as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck				313697.727555303

he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king and as the wound is very serious seeing that after crossing the shoulder it penetrates into the chest it is to be feared at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head but frightfully pale appeared under the fringe				293021.21676546335
now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the one celebrated in the thousand and one nights well it is one of his descendants and a great friend of mine he is a very rich englishman eccentric almost to insanity and his real name is lord wilmore ah indeed				1522.5185528697336

the question of carrying the city by assault though often debated in the council of the king had been always rejected				390236.7392763978
he had half guessed what was going on when he saw franz quit the cemetery with m de villefort				517.1342229731216
adieu i go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other the abbé with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of caderousse opened the door himself got out and mounted his horse once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the road he had travelled in coming				11110.142920063592

the shoulder of athos the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of aramis d artagnan in a state of fury crossed the antechamber at three bounds and was darting toward the stairs which he reckoned upon descending four at a time when in his heedless course he ran head foremost against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m de tréville s private rooms and striking his shoulder violently made him utter a cry or rather a howl				190556.0188087959

besides the king i am certain awaits your majesty s reply before risking anything you will tell him my lord resumed the queen despairingly that i can do nothing that i have suffered as much as himself more than he has obliged as i am to eat the bread of exile and to ask hospitality from false friends who smile at my tears and as regards his royal person he must sacrifice it generously and die like a king				535.6518727507167

i will tell you all replied anne				17257.423155944856
his fearless deportment his words so firm yet dignified the shades which by one word he had evoked recalled to her the past in all its intoxication of poetry and romance youth beauty the eclat of love at twenty years of age the bloody death of buckingham the only man whom she had ever really loved and the heroism of those obscure champions who had saved her from the double hatred of richelieu and the king				619.9139564423157

i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour				1594.7688166822927
mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwell s permission				5957.315166262123
that was still the situation of affairs up to the early days of february				15810.391599120654

what is he looking at				27907.438901658756
he brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before and who had just arrived this woman entered and approaching milady s bed offered her services				69012.05220666793
i am going home				1475.755096925836
have they not obeyed me it is done as your excellency may have observed your horse is in the great gateway ready saddled for your departure that is well do as i have directed you then what the devil said the host to himself				317.33932227241036
exceedingly replied franz				108.00598081916432
la ramee stretched out his legs grimaud took a table cloth tore it into strips and tied la ramee s feet together				794.2048783761643
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the parade he had already three inches of steel in his breast				1540.7578989052283
not to reply would be a blot on my name and my honor that is my opinion said aramis				57.901842079276875
there he saw a lengthy chain of people gliding under the walls				9923.713699761598
you are right cried the affrighted mme				136.90962822619153
it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shop people and the bands of mendicants reappeared				2811.3218604709136
it is true the letter of the cardinal spada was singularly circumstantial and dantès repeated it to himself from one end to the other for he had not forgotten a word				635.0016430468802
but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the door a beautiful fair face whose large blue eyes were without any marked expression fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips				697.3982364786443
the young man having left his horse tied to the gate in the court mounted the great staircase and addressed the guard in the first chamber				859.2677967223742
bertuccio cried he striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong				9761.478838160456
but it seems to me that that which he is just now undergoing is hard enough in any case aramis replied the punishment should fall not on the king but on his ministers for the first article of the constitution is the king can do no wrong as for me thought porthos giving mordaunt his whole attention were it not for breaking in on the majesty of the situation i would leap down from the bench reach mordaunt in three bounds and strangle him i would then take him by the feet and knock the life out of these wretched musketeers who parody the musketeers of france				720.1435789225914
let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable moment and when it presents itself profit by it ah said dantès you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you i assure you replied the old man i did not turn to that source for recreation or support what did you do then i wrote or studied were you then permitted the use of pens ink and paper oh no answered the abbé i had none but what i made for myself you made paper pens and ink yes dantès gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing				282397.0277675955
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets				218063.69054849134
adieu mademoiselle				55455.49183334644
still then i am a prisoner said milady looking around her and bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer but i feel assured it will not be for long added she				867.9410274855964
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself				1668.3517247545747
ah said morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted				271489.48699662864
what next				7916.259436685268
well cried his auditors at the moment you left his house aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort like a man who in the full relation of a falsehood finds himself stopped by some unforeseen obstacle but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him their ears were wide open and there were no means of retreat				3997.8666449252014
and yet notwithstanding this want of respect he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his veins passion drunk with contempt but passion or thirst as the reader pleases				44065.47408529528
grimaud had now finished his accounts				4849.992720051807
d épinay said he allow me to remind you at this moment which is perhaps not so ill chosen as at first sight may appear for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by madame de saint méran on her death bed that valentine s wedding might not be deferred				92379.5125321236
our friend will see you soon and he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which your safety required you should be concealed				11951.713226644235
the popular banker found that it answered better than count				227.4610613729409
at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need				15756.684848208153
a short gallop brought them to the road of chaillot the day began to decline carriages were passing and repassing				351968.00215703883
oh cried porthos do you think so you are exaggerating athos we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant				1302.6592221420244

his next care on leaving the barber s who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor s suit a garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap				479547.7883304079
and taking it from felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it				93.17163952562517
for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions				191519.42569039756

i was worn out with fatigue				5243.787432964631
oh i saw the snare and i answered you would be quite in despair on your return				916.8385877055028
when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of alexander s feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother				1621.2822285940874
read this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe				9297.517149151
the law would seize it and put you in prison if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three francs will be given you instead of a diamond worth or perhaps francs from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other				945.9962973996231
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters i am free to do so				472.3979077215222
oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him				70.46159610648412
then listen to me				83.8302888244328
to what end				864.2909716598372

pardon me and then tell me how i can risk my life to serve your grace you are a brave young man said buckingham holding out his hand to d artagnan who pressed it respectfully				4550.449335877913
porthos was magnificent his spurs jingled his cuirass glittered his sword knocked proudly against his ample limbs				15188.705061210208
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the faubourg saint honoré				13968.278551115362
then taking a passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two months longer chapter				321.2647129623059

franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment the table was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes around him				83.07707657127466
well he did remain with them and your majesty has in him so firm a champion that it was he who gave jussac the terrible sword thrust which has made the cardinal so angry he who wounded jussac cried the king he a boy				920.5174090406099
well laporte asked the queen				434.0684033899989
ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his pocket threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way				720.0440023544874
the last raised his eyes to ascertain doubtless that neither his companions nor himself had been watched and in spite of the darkness he perceived gondy				3276.6468674186917
they returned to the hotel at the door franz ordered the coachman to be ready at eight				7608.608332479167
sometimes he hoped it could not be mme				167.54485496681465
aramis muttered to himself we shall hear nothing but the usual commonplace things porthos sucked his mustache muttering a good deal of ceremony to night about crushing an adder athos shrunk into his corner pale and motionless as a bas relief				31036.119547502465
gold a devoted friend and a letter from the king our husband and master de winter bowed again unable to reply from excess of emotion				3156.9438276091014
then i saw no more but i heard the noise of breaking furniture				5287.521335337688
france enfeebled the authority of her sovereign contemned her nobles returning to their former turbulence and insolence her enemies within her frontiers all proved the great richelieu no longer in existence				4645.15339213414
we have only lived up to the present time because we believed each other dead and because a remembrance is less oppressive than a living creature though a remembrance is sometimes devouring but said milady in a hollow faint voice what brings you back to me and what do you want with me i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes i have not lost sight of you you know what i have done i can relate to you day by day your actions from your entrance to the service of the cardinal to this evening a smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of milady				717.4584704139497
june and july were the terrible months with athos				312.5007820523118
is the spot far from here a hundred leagues it is not ill planned said the governor				1251.3043864124495
why oh nothing but that he might get me out of this if he were favorably inclined to me you are probably nearer freedom than he is so it will be your business to get him out and said the prisoner what talk is there of war with spain with spain no answered d artagnan but paris what do you mean cried rochefort				890.4827955027225
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps				1555.2661240462792
i have seen him that is he				501.65071510746367
he has but one fault he is somewhat wilful but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious i think so madame because i myself have made use of them that i might not be poisoned at naples at palermo and at smyrna that is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions i must have lost my life and your precautions were successful completely so yes i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort indeed said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited i really did not remember i inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on men of the north as on men of the south and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south and that is the case observed monte cristo				252.12556915991323
her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the previous evening so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion to franz				924.7682020296235
i had been fifteen days without seeing a human face and had been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles that was no reason for staking my diamond replied d artagnan closing his hand with a nervous spasm				250869.87734772093
the king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation although distant as they were from the queen they could not count the studs				13878.411082687047
monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenances nothing was omitted go on go on said d artagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come				1244.6608788324854
on the contrary i think they are poor sir they are friends of yours then yes sir exclaimed mordaunt they are friends dear friends of mine and i would lay down my life for them very well mordaunt exclaimed cromwell pleased at having his opinion of the young man raised once more i will give them to you i will not even ask who they are do as you like with them thank you sir exclaimed mordaunt thank you my life is always at your service and should i lose it i should still owe you something thank you you have indeed repaid me munificently for my services he threw himself at the feet of cromwell and in spite of the efforts of the puritan general who did not like this almost kingly homage he took his hand and kissed it				76.99275882441655
it is not of bread and meat of which he makes the greatest consumption				266264.8123792572
d artagnan and planchet remained for some moments still on the defensive then as the noise of the horsemen became more and more distant they sheathed their swords				2252.6701411598146

oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedy weapons i own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly jealousy indicates affection true but i am not jealous he is of whom of debray no of you of me				129.84384432963847
they have been speaking of my marriage have they not yes replied the angry look				1133.7674054922243
yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition and villefort s father extended his hand to the bell rope to summon the servant whom his son had not called				3066.9520253653614

in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study				3562.143509550399
edmond said mercédès i have but one word more to say to you the count smiled bitterly				29750.266715475867
is there any difficulty in the way no replied the captain but we must warn your excellency that the island is an infected port what do you mean monte cristo although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six days on our return to leghorn the deuce				4090.73395043758
yes there are two hundred of them and each of them will need two which will make four hundred but four hundred what listen cried d artagnan				205.4210547025372
valentine and the old man heard this conversation and noirtier fixed his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the look				990.5733911384621

danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way				655.1350166878248
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient strength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole				191989.95388221022

m d épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that m de villefort who appeared to be aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning should not have anticipated him in this announcement no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances would have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history				10871.73380028538

oh my brain whirls i no longer understand anything				1884.8635646629484
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the king when in their turn they were in power your brother would be today in all probability condemned to death				688.2794592902702
athos and aramis suppressed as well as they could the disgust they felt in the presence of such coarseness and brutality				253877.16516918637
the cold gains upon me				115.23928524212307
more than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house whence he heard the noisy play of his son who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his mother				1610.7638509956178
what is the matter exclaimed d artagnan anxiously what has happened to you my lord all is lost cried buckingham becoming as pale as a corpse two of the studs are wanting there are only ten can you have lost them my lord or do you think they have been stolen they have been stolen replied the duke and it is the cardinal who has dealt this blow				2333.162884684734
giving him to understand that the police would deal with him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord for in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a great lord he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness d artagnan should get up and depart as quickly as possible				1110.303528702283
d artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity				449961.46677838475
not at all				565.2148287989328
upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching monte cristo				407.7345306617576
and he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass				1926.9634018963739
why should an exception be made in her favor i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception it is true but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come carlini s teeth clenched convulsively				12323.318763095855
ah my poor friend				735.6396793408303
when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help				5089.898655586492
i waited a month or rather i suffered for a month				1379.8027000705422
after having been for some time after the death of louis xiii				1182.3555743501431
monsieur said the cardinal you have been arrested by my orders so they tell me monseigneur do you know why no monseigneur for the only thing for which i could be arrested is still unknown to your eminence richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man				183.5057388077197
thanks monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan emptying his glass that is all i wanted of you				200.2105998957498
you are really ill and just now were so pale as you came into the room was i pale albert yes a pallor that suits you admirably mother but which did not the less alarm my father and myself did your father speak of it inquired mercédès eagerly				3568.059413709753
it would be a curious idea and maybe i should find my friend under the name of achilles				394601.45556711586
confound it				77.29450538706136
all the spectators returned him his salute accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four after which all four disappeared in the bastion whither grimaud had preceded them				135.82313862167877
d artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not foreseen				8817.819328006852
de guiche fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man and the spaniard who had advanced to meet raoul aimed in his turn and raoul felt a pain in the left arm similar to that of a blow from a whip				10950.660908151243
i know you now				1012.9675953314842
there said he it s done				1596.513470755073
do with this commission what you will only remember though the name be blank it is to you i give it i shall never forget it replied d artagnan				71.45826268946837
m de tréville being informed of this by his eminence packed his portmanteau and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to paris it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort				2105.9342201356776
you don t like playing then on the contrary i do lansquenet for instance devoted to it				89.0746492157767
nothing more than natural				137565.02030010556
now especially did he find the description valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the staircase and while he was feeling his way a sob indicated the direction he was to take				41957.0013983394
that is not difficult				51098.12809405504
meantime aramis had drawn near to the coadjutor who smiling all the while contrived to drop some words into his ear				3664.435146767536
look well at me said monte cristo putting the light near his face				936.5904081913842
disguised it was very boldly written if disguised stop a bit said the abbé taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a piece of prepared linen with his left hand the first two or three words of the accusation				9351.726605467891
they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantès had partly filled in				1045.7711972992115
so for the future i hope you will not be so destructive dantès raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the coverlet				401752.35924607806
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful is it still only an intention your eminence asked d artagnan				131.73918398359194
where is he there in the salon				3076.4579407353135
athos led his guest into a dining room of moderate size the windows of which opened on one side on a garden on the other on a hot house full of magnificent flowers				2221.7403394355756
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellow the true type of a duenna or a devotee				363629.30260880676
so i have been told already monseigneur cried bonacieux giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him but i swear to you that i know nothing about it the cardinal repressed a smile				533.4755409326749
immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire				308972.75395063136
after a moment s mournful silence his heart overflowed and he gave way to a flood of tears				2813.4340082973267
everything points to the conclusion sire said the minister of police that death was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination				14575.76195080806
monte cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to maximilian s room when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still				5819.791405458568
more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de château renaud but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint méran despised all who were not noble				51534.2693083218
one expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner if i had listened to you lord de winter had said to felton				523.6081598332732
milady rushed to the door and opened it				90.73664258752159
peste edmond you have a very handsome mistress she is not my mistress replied the young sailor gravely she is my betrothed sometimes one and the same thing said morrel with a smile				503.2861934327239
moreover something had been said of a marriage with mazarin s niece				80973.40675770446
not at all my dear sir said la carconte in her most gracious manner				1079.4126657789752
oh that s nothing				531.4043322052866
for an instant the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her daughter that albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them				128.90657846149787
well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier				21856.680261673275
why should you meddle with what does not concern you the two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation				1410.6465129859814
they looked at the cord still hanging from the loophole and broken at about twenty feet from the ground				1594.7125447428432
might he not have come for the purpose of laying a snare for him				89.47339397536584
oh murmured the count shall i then be permitted to love again				451.70421436768595
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior				10578.295650813112
during the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself				2296.7156454750057
are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one relating to the poisoning of mirabeau asked the count are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes in which it is difficult to believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow creatures yes sir indeed the jailer antoine told me one connected with this very dungeon monte cristo shuddered antoine had been his jailer				28341.808202957433
d artagnan was a woman and still more a mother				1611.4729375348397
we must seize the felucca said aramis				27.29993411417563
he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma the one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with gold				1138.651064032196
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg™ license terms from this work or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg™				55547.6436728505
at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave way my father fell on one knee and at the same moment twenty hands were thrust forth armed with sabres pistols and poniards twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his feet				988.1904614824197
as to the commencement of an intrigue between her and m de wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinal s favor				1798.5785369961252
monsieur had just retired and the youthful louis remaining the last was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers in a line of battle a game which delighted him much				1531.8849733799696
an opportunity will come replied rochefort				788.4054390180908
will your excellency give your name or remain incognito asked the captain				750.21969964701
but you only asked francs for a fowl we have a fixed price for all our provisions				13001.007520399382
this time danglars had double reason to understand for if the word and gesture had not explained the speaker s meaning it was clearly expressed by the man walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide				25909.993772453723
go away he said				344.0864010735648
quick quick				4490.213685296292
you wish to see me and you come to england				946.3116591972935
but that is all				609.091334614444
they arrived without accident at the hotel de la chevrette				41353.46206110482
what will it signify if one two or three more are added				344519.03867521294
let me see with regard to porthos i received a letter from him too				1481.006946591144
for a while nothing was heard in the room but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful hearts mounted to heaven				814.436941750133
d artagnan relates that on his first visit to m de tréville captain of the king s musketeers he met in the antechamber three young men serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor of being received bearing the names of athos porthos and aramis				389.8976265653074
i shall stop and conceal myself a few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me				96.65762528650872
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenant s heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events				6021.792544152217
yes my lord said the marshal you have divined all that was possible to human genius recall le plessis bellievre villequier and d erlac said the prince recall all the troops that are on this side of the lys				13537.73223141682
your excellency knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits what cried albert whose courage revolted at the idea of being plundered tamely not make any resistance no for it would be useless				2365.1182453961014
your eminence may be certain of that the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately				1331.1475046401033
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling yes				1125.5667713803991
call madame de villefort wake madame de villefort cried the procureur from the door of his chamber which apparently he scarcely dared to leave				3799.3242709573
i only ask a brokerage of course that is perfectly just cried m de boville				12106.68550009395
like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellow creatures				4263.17712860263
madame wait at the door whilst i shall be at the head of the king s bed ready to die for him laporte went out the queen remained standing near the hangings whilst d artagnan glided behind the curtains				12011.428076703036
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and i come back still more weary and low spirited that s all				610.2201476745151
yes he appears to be a resolute fellow well he will do more than he has promised he will do wonders then the curate rejoined planchet who was waiting for him on the stairs				2604.524732394256
you do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular misers				407276.57219955995
for me cried the boy his eyes sparkling with joy if i can find out where bazin is going				2284.715683269844
onward cried the gascon				1201.5701163973044
the queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies				12712.247750309563
vampa was twelve and teresa eleven				11009.00621516181
it is then the cardinal s custom to walk in his orangery asked d artagnan				18.935249863304282
excuse me said d artagnan endeavoring to resume his course excuse me but i am in a hurry scarcely had he descended the first stair when a hand of iron seized him by the belt and stopped him				79.5231052282214
let s be merciful to every sinner				344360.709649541
what s to be done what did the cardinal say about me i was to take your dispatches written or verbal and return by post and when he shall know what you have done he will advise what you have to do i must then remain here here or in the neighborhood you can not take me with you no the order is imperative				397349.09095846873
it is the people who do not obey that i punish and not those who like you obey but too well				606.4659368846352
yes undoubtedly the abbé busoni himself replied monte cristo				109.9112973378283
let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal and how he likes but the queen is sacred and if anyone speaks of her let it be respectfully porthos you are as vain as narcissus i plainly tell you so replied aramis				173.169294215573
a moment after those who surprised by this tumult had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it saw the door open and four men clothed in black not come out of it but fly like so many frightened crows leaving on the ground and on the corners of the furniture feathers from their wings that is to say patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks				4686.074964356677
on the front of the monument was inscribed the families of saint méran and villefort for such had been the last wish expressed by poor renée valentine s mother				1597.6466528192439
she passed an hour without breathing panting with a cold sweat upon her brow and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement she heard in the corridor				3033.5229004725747
it was an old soldier of the guards who could not see his king pass captive before him without rendering him this final homage				34869.83085122412
you are irritated and vexed tell me how this fernand is related to you he is merely my father said albert m				467.58519962020944
the answer known he had yielded to albert s wish to be introduced to haydée and allowed the conversation to turn on the death of ali and had not opposed haydée s recital but having doubtless warned the young girl in the few romaic words he spoke to her not to implicate morcerf s father				522.6774474740296
i dislike these quarrels among men of the church gondy withdrew distributing benedictions on his way and finding a malicious satisfaction in causing the adherents of his foes to prostrate themselves at his feet				967.1636481110071
both these ladies had been awakened in the middle of the night and did not know what it all was about				3264.952707585665
where do you keep your wine no no thanks				1570.1729918845142
the palace of the louvre contains two things the king who must die and royalty which never dies				223846.12254341244
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us				532.6898285569157
when he was within twenty paces of it he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped				1140.8439808232877
perfectly well quite rested sir you are still growing athos continued with that charming and paternal interest felt by a grown man for a youth				4630.985868297627
coquenard gently advised him to be patient				45536.206978669565
the young men filled up their third of a glass with water then when they had drunk half the glass they filled it up again and continued to do so				555.2499819842657
contact the foundation as set forth in section below				3613.4631512467804
but wait				4584.381068801886
he had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the bottom of the silver casket and to let the knife fall into it making a sign to laporte that he was no longer able to speak then in a last convulsion which this time he had not the power to combat he slipped from the sofa to the floor				1348.0626403034626
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès inquired the abbé of caderousse				894.0665220746725
i set out three days ago passing miraculously through the puritan army and i took post horses with my servant tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in paris				434.38871949206873
will these be in your way he said to the executioner raising his long locks if so they can be tied up charles accompanied these words with a look designed to penetrate the mask of the unknown headsman				165794.62398107714
meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment ah				290.3272069869576
her pretty face arrested my attention i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her				243.09668009806782
well asked the queen well madame replied the valet i followed them as far as the gates				9814.236901227943
they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the shutter				19106.39833300217
parry too started and stopped reading				7175.4984277202375
one of the three will certainly be at home perhaps all three				6070.938135959228
dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently				215930.7290527053
during this time nothing new occurred in the camp at la rochelle only the king who was bored as always but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of st louis at st germain and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty musketeers				1300.1868844740543
she knew him she knew that at her return from a fruitless journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment in vain to enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone				294181.2550822048
at the door they found the carriage				1342.3224222860733
aramis related what had been agreed upon				2774.745218977475
in all three clerks and a half which for the time argued a very extensive clientage				422757.73260765284
i have brought away ten or twelve wounded				2419.8561496523525
now said planchet let us bind him to a tree this being properly done they drew the comte de wardes close to his servant and as night was approaching and as the wounded man and the bound man were at some little distance within the wood it was evident they were likely to remain there till the next day				456.1045907506107
the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate men that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes this was precisely what franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of the colosseum				59679.63167734982
yes that is the very boy he s patronized by bazin ah yes i know of what importance is this little reptile to you asked porthos				127.16515070581757
coquenard was in the dilemma of harpagan				386271.94192251004
come speak said the latter closing the door and bolting it that they might not be disturbed				17121.99809852694
d artagnan related everything with that simple and ingenuous air which he knew how to assume on occasions				19640.61697709753
seeing a stranger escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers and to whom the governor spoke bareheaded dantès who guessed the truth and that the moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped hands				519.3543288378257
for you know athos				32.289279141532624
ah that would indeed be infamous how did danglars usually write in a handsome running hand and how was the anonymous letter written backhanded again the abbé smiled				645.8490423475137
at last they stood face to face in the very room where ten minutes before mordaunt had been talking to cromwell				2276.918841157389
he had not seen morrel				578.6516219615319
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s				1114.0428503022083
it may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to monsieur de gondy s coachman				3723.373557089228
no doubt my boy no doubt				1884.8348041468296
come if so you will count and continue this conversation at my house any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i will show you my father m noirtier de villefort one of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a man who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth but who has helped to overturn one of the greatest in fact a man who believed himself like you one of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being not of providence but of fate				2362.3320249134895
but let us go continued de winter let us be off the boat must be waiting for us and there is our sloop at anchor do you see it there				881.8235317592366
and what will he promise us said d artagnan				5.943769373693531
he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear				94377.96150184107
do you think so said the host bewildered boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable there is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed				1905.1584888495713
nor i said athos				10.094743251342846
pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called me well said albert				796.3182158900897
now m bertuccio is alone in the world he uses my property without accounting for the use he makes of it he is sure never to leave my service why because i should never get a better probabilities are deceptive but i deal in certainties he is the best servant over whom one has the power of life and death do you possess that right over bertuccio yes there are words which close a conversation with an iron door such was the count s yes the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirty two horses dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight hours				5165.814364595868
bertuccio crouched in the corner of the carriage began to examine with a feverish anxiety every house they passed				2418.1939835414473

aramis obeyed				1535.5035550082334
in short madame danglars not being able personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money had deputed those eyes by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person				1276.164872505261
at daybreak i left the chamber without noise leaving my charming companion asleep				3217.5024550961866
since last evening he added smiling you have done enough in my service and if you have any personal matters to settle it is just that i should give you time thank you sir it will be well employed i hope cromwell turned as he was going				2484.988236715595

milady listened				2153.4297556380548
he reached the hedge and hid himself behind it in passing by the house where the scene which we have related took place he remarked that the window was again lighted up and he was convinced that aramis had not yet returned to his own apartment and that when he did it would not be alone				999.1616909425696
your life is devoted from this moment and does not belong to you				207.9474739338424

i believe with your majesty that monsieur de tréville s guarantee is more than sufficient tréville bowed very respectfully with a joy that was not unmixed with fear he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding				248240.776360009
it was to that obedience i owe her portrait d artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended				228215.81735892256
he passes for a very charitable man				212.1589096015743

i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day said beauchamp but he is perfectly unknown to me have you mentioned this death in your paper it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i doubt if it will please m villefort for it says that if four successive deaths had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king s attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it still said château renaud dr				241106.2467790081

gondy who began to feel uneasy examined the tapestry with his eyes touched the coat of mail which he wore under his long gown and felt from time to time to see if the handle of a good spanish dagger which was hidden under his cloak was well within reach				26878.56161668825
the old man did not answer but looked at his master with wild staring eyes while with his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright				275751.4121670225
but having some days previously seen from the top of the donjon madame de montbazon pass in her carriage and still cherishing an affection for that beautiful woman he did not wish to be to her what he wished to be to mazarin and in the hope of seeing her again had asked for a leaden comb which was allowed him				81.6589682413637

it is six o clock said madame de villefort evidently agitated				3365.0069341130593
the sentinel was unwilling to leave his post but allowed parry to pass				1914.680964709554
i shall want you this evening he said return in two hours my lord said d artagnan i have an appointment in two hours which i can not miss do not be uneasy said mazarin it is the same good thought d artagnan i fancied it was so return then at five o clock and bring that worthy monsieur du vallon with you				137.74965276203804
this corridor was guarded not by a sentinel but by a confidential servant through whom in case of urgency charles could communicate instantly with his faithful subject				1864.9982544358797
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris				451.9351707789962
poor things				1800.8131901956485
full then of this conviction he pulled his cap down over his eyes and endeavoring to copy some of the court airs he had picked up in gascony among young traveling nobles he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword and the other resting on his hip				38792.19073101471
is the king wounded cried lord winter				1023.6807333475991
it was necessary to reach m de tréville it was important that he should be informed of what was passing				7094.627498500214
i am on the point of starting on a journey replied morrel disdainfully				61188.77146553407
ah my mother my poor mother said albert gazing through his tears at his mother s portrait if you know this how much must you suffer come said beauchamp taking both his hands take courage my friend but how came that first note to be inserted in your journal				68469.24974636748
well now i have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little madame bonacieux who is that her lover what is his name oh your eminence knows him well cried milady carried away by her anger				1575.2575065511774
but fortunately the world is a sepulcher the men and consequently the women are but shadows and love is a sentiment to which you cry fie				41938.99926987124
ah really this is magnificent				8354.596698510588
yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule				241278.0707908036
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de château renaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf				1457.5566878629672
indeed indeed maximilian i am very miserable and if you love me it must be out of pity valentine replied the young man deeply affected i will not say you are all i love in the world for i dearly prize my sister and brother in law but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no manner resembling what i feel for you				167.78406126831143
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens				52121.40490228516
and then sir do you wish me to speak freely to you continued d artagnan with his frank expression				3462.7634529906863
certainly as m danglars says you are rich and perfectly free				4482.366991891646
it was even according to our present manners something like an infamous action but at that period people did not manage affairs as they do today				3664.644833427679
and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him because he knows everything do you then really suffer asked morrel quickly				1837.378601030394
they don t burn sorcerers nowadays no				575.8215292541737
oh yes she said i saw but i can not believe would you rather die then and cause maximilian s death oh repeated the young girl almost bewildered can i not leave the house can i not escape valentine the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere your servants will be seduced with gold and death will be offered to you disguised in every shape				185738.73051942972
i have engaged the three lower windows at the café rospoli should i have obtained the requisite pardon for peppino the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it and whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing the execution send one of your men disguised as a penitent friar and i will give it to him				83.35225604560729
and in exchange for the sacrifice that you make gentlemen i promise not to reward you i believe that word would offend you but to love you as a sister to prefer you next to my husband and my children to every one				815.0060788293893
they seek for him in the mountains and he is on the waters they follow him on the waters and he is on the open sea then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the islands at giglio giannutri or monte cristo and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia and how does he behave towards travellers alas				1257.3440733789835
i can not reconcile myself to this idea it would madden me				118.77355945702399
i pardon you said he the ill you have done me				95.66723737242735
he converted his chamber into an observatory				408976.6821865417
devoted men are so rare tréville by the back staircase				1145.1425616151885
then she retired so gently that valentine did not know she had left the room				194.92464511164283
lastly he had taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near				3295.6571657093946
mercédès saw it and with the double instinct of woman and mother guessed all but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears				41911.65082653846
i can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved				364672.88293571083
médéah was standing at the rack eating his hay				315297.54174697667
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in spite of that and of his being king s attorney he is a man like ourselves and i fancy not a bad sort of one perhaps not replied danglars but i hear that he is ambitious and that s rather against him well well returned m morrel we shall see				839.5462093180566
monte cristo put his head out of the window exchanged a few words with him in a low tone and the steward disappeared				1335.1746657865858
between six and seven o clock the road of chaillot is quite deserted you might as well go and ride in the forest of bondy but suppose we all go said d artagnan what the devil				673.0738966183291
i remember well that diamond which belonged to the queen you see then that i speak to you in the queen s name				921.7832948211648
everything was in readiness				317072.386691598
are you satisfied sir continued the notary addressing the old man				225.49849914975167
what are you saying to her said morcerf in an undertone				10203.751356122913
oh you will give me five minutes grace replied morcerf for i also expect a preserver of whom of myself cried morcerf parbleu do you think i can not be saved as well as anyone else and that there are only arabs who cut off heads				2832.6783237611376
a quarter of an hour was the reply				718.5417261245552
who o o pla andrea got into the cab which passed rapidly through the faubourg saint denis along the faubourg saint martin crossed the barrier and threaded its way through the interminable villette				81285.59885429271
but added the queen in awaiting the cardinal s decision let there be if you please a reference to the king only the deputies bowed and left the room				192.97982310715932
a terrible vision chapter xli				22413.823465608988
i have sworn and now madame try to make your peace with god for you are judged by men milady let her head sink as if crushed by this sentence				28280.815743648993
you should have allowed me to sleep				1346.4501614928752
oh i see you prefer peregrination				775156.0367831733
i think these fellows will never come if you are in haste monsieur said d artagnan with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days and if it be your will to dispatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself i pray you there is another word which pleases me cried athos with a gracious nod to d artagnan				148.14024235489657
just so replied aramis				19.486316392866716
oh if my mother were still living there would be nothing to fear maximilian for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us i fear valentine replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the happiness of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me now it is you who are unjust maximilian cried valentine but there is one thing i wish to know and what is that inquired the young man perceiving that valentine hesitated				4582.48401060693
mousqueton stood at the door and porthos was inside the carriage				1453.7654432390125
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him				86.18850101445116
monte cristo noticed the general astonishment and began laughing and joking about it				88.66694179925665
you talk like a noodle my friend said caderousse and here is danglars who is a wide awake clever deep fellow who will prove to you that you are wrong				1326.0457402217394
i cried bonacieux i deceive your eminence your wife in going to rue de vaugirard and rue de la harpe did not go to find linen drapers then why did she go just god she went to meet the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham yes cried bonacieux recalling all his remembrances of the circumstances yes that s it				76.80710505858914
well replied d artagnan bending his mouth to athos s ear and lowering his voice milady is marked with a fleur de lis upon her shoulder ah cried the musketeer as if he had received a ball in his heart				418.5670536969657
three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities				341798.20030405093
ah yes he said i know them				166.57507200199956
that s too many gentlemen too many				371097.70300941804
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time d artagnan was better informed than she was				1029.598274835576
the musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed and which indeed have survived them of the procurators of the period meanness stinginess fasts but as after all excepting some few acts of economy which porthos had always found very unseasonable the procurator s wife had been tolerably liberal that is be it understood for a procurator s wife he hoped to see a household of a highly comfortable kind				12291.370127262837
of what consequence replied milady				111.33099763497647
let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here our future tranquillity depends upon our jailers being entirely ignorant of it advancing to the opening he stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight then fitting it into its place he said you removed this stone very carelessly but i suppose you had no tools to aid you why exclaimed dantès with astonishment do you possess any i made myself some and with the exception of a file i have all that are necessary a chisel pincers and lever oh how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience well in the first place here is my chisel so saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood				507200.42981965153
madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity				20357.09013545591
chapter lxvi				58927.106310237046
but listen to me valentine and i will tell you all about it				85.72767392003281
as for athos they believed him to be dead and left him very quiet on the field of battle not thinking it worth the trouble to carry him away				637.5581039050624
a concierge waited at the door to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a scene of terror				1039.9540817417183
let us consider first the ancient rights				334706.8014845326
have you brought your arms i what for				848.3940934000251
athos extended his arm toward him pointing him out to his companions				907.0709920978459
porthos murmured d artagnan look well at that priest yes said porthos i see him				53.74085625233086
do you see that ray of sunlight i do well the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you				180.49361446790368
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone				7636.42829517703
this was the chief of the band luigi vampa				3807.267629477128
those who love me follow me and he jumped on his horse and set off at full gallop snuffing the fresh air in his triumph and shouting out with an expression of face which it would be impossible to describe free				4564.514123907582
my very self replied planchet but i wanted first to see if thou wert grown proud proud toward an old friend				782.775618420047
sit down morrel and wait morrel obeyed the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven				870.2128117723362
good muttered mazarin sitting down we shall soon see something startling the queen s eyes followed the retreating figures and when the last had closed the door she turned away				634.3140712779102
it was caracalla s circus				323600.9337899231
you have nothing more to ask of me my lord said rochefort				595.2564431419092
beauchamp is a worthy fellow said monte cristo when the journalist was gone is he not albert yes and a sincere friend i love him devotedly				211568.3413778006
albert found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty room on the ground floor containing all the ingenious instruments the english eminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggish have invented for fishing				312971.0002304474
he is very susceptible bah said debray he scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort you said so yourself true				1056.2141241244187
the instant she appeared the door keeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment and on her affirmative answer being given he conducted her by a private passage to m de villefort s office				3165.2582575113506
let us go on				518.8107796887873
we have no litmus paper but see here they come with the syrup of violets the doctor was right steps were heard in the passage				2397.1248936289194
i don t like people to quiz me sir said the young man do you not come from paris if you please d artagnan thought it was some gossip who wanted news from the capital				3009.2901385005894
the young king would perhaps show us some gratitude but the queen would never forgive us and it is she whom we have to consider				336160.3994069951
by the torchlight dantès saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes				5795.24489464526
oh why is not the world a wilderness she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle d armilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow				2478.981963333606
the people are hurrying on the soldiers under arms and among the spectators i see d artagnan				111.72538593319234
the wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life and i was immediately set at liberty and then it was i presume said monte cristo that you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the abbé busoni it was your excellency the benevolent abbé took an evident interest in all that concerned me				106.18264272777516
m de morcerf opened the door himself and as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open door with his servant				1348.0947810045323
that was d artagnan s road as he was going to the louvre				7798.532880246018

at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her				247.03477440162686
adieu my kind friends				487.24052699496724
meanwhile oblige me by a sight of one of these tavolettas nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency s wish said the landlord opening the door of the chamber i have caused one to be placed on the landing close by your apartment then taking the tablet from the wall he handed it to franz who read as follows the public is informed that on wednesday february being the first day of the carnival executions will take place in the piazza del popolo by order of the tribunal of the rota of two persons named andrea rondolo and peppino otherwise called rocca priori the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest named don césar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary bandit luigi vampa and his band				36096.143381181995
he had apparently given previous orders for as he reached the bottom step his carriage came from the coach house ready for him				80.66498300482041
valentine looked at the young man they heard the street door close then m de villefort locked the garden door and returned upstairs				3068.581612613207
embrace also our good and brave porthos				240.47816590430753
if we had been five murmured athos thinking of d artagnan and porthos				349.03065657072676
the handsome madeleine announced to d artagnan that planchet had returned bringing mousqueton with him who had heroically borne the extraction of the ball and was as well as his state would permit				9724.108663349312
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement				4306.849251138158
will you accompany me to the harbor maximilian i am entirely yours count morrel accompanied the count to the harbor				7125.065016720869
my lord has forgotten the supper no but i have forgotten monsieur grimaud my lord understands that there can be no supper unless he is allowed to be present go on then have it your own way come here my lad said la ramee and hear what i have to say grimaud approached with a very sullen expression on his face				985.8898889953542
go and fetch a physician said she				49.05258262470366
what made you choose a house at the gates of paris m bertuccio i cried the steward with a strange expression				3302.339628592077
at this moment villefort returned				726.5954417305362
at this corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment				820.7960781724622
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground				1552.5194089843176
well said the coadjutor on seeing him you are in disgrace then abbé this was the orthodox phrase				16332.846084539833
within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem most agreeable to you				187.0610103280264
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m andrea cavalcanti s solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration				1505.3418917180861
but said villefort who was the first to break the silence i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question				1954.9012492654804
bazin became a lay brother				1471.9930217133956
to wait replied athos				10.115609860690341
the count does not know how should i know				940.5722586241694
d artagnan placed in line with his company saluted with an expressive gesture his three friends whose eyes soon discovered him and m de tréville who detected him at once				2131.044844559536
ah you are awake madame he said then i have nothing more to do here				803.0308374387006
morrel was dreaming and monte cristo was looking at the dreamer				222045.68494741415
he was then reconducted by the little staircase instead of passing through the ante chamber where d artagnan was waiting				2984.3030694521244
coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment				62681.35302895567
do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come i have been advised of it but the three millions the three millions are probably on the road then i shall really have them oh well said the count i do not think you have yet known the want of money andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a moment				666.3190360973147
at this spot milady had come out of the wood and entered the carriage				1431.1538775213473
let our readers reassure themselves				9010.886839435801

villefort retained his place but his marriage was put off until a more favorable opportunity				358682.40280499426
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance alas said milady i believe so the queen is so good oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with enthusiasm				6923.535889238193
those in whom the king has confided lord leven s highlanders no said winter then he paused but tell me can you not perceive the russet tint which marks the heavens not the least in the world said aramis and athos at once				1734.5763867839362
he who fires the first shot rarely hits his man for he fires with the apprehension of being disarmed before an armed foe then whilst he fires make your horse rear that manoeuvre has saved my life several times i shall do so if only in gratitude eh cried athos are not those fellows poachers they have arrested yonder				64116.843136098585
the newly introduced personage followed bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out and the moment the door closed they have seen each other said he approaching the cardinal eagerly				3891.322245477711
when we observed this to him he told us all to trouble ourselves about our own business as this horse belonged to him				76.02424505655149

once more replied the major				2154.914043983427
the people kept back by louvieres had not made another step forward but the awful murmuring which indicates an angry people continued				3184.262996267242
and now he said when he saw that dantès had read the last line put the two fragments together and judge for yourself dantès obeyed and the conjointed pieces gave the following this day of april be ing invited to dine by his holiness alexander vi and fearing that not content with making me pay for my hat he may desire to become my heir and re serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara and bentivoglio who were poisoned i declare to my nephew guido spada my sole heir that i have bu ried in a place he knows and has visited with me that is in the caves of the small island of monte cristo all i poss essed of ingots gold money jewels diamonds gems that i alone know of the existence of this treasure which may amount to nearly two mil lions of roman crowns and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro ck from the small creek to the east in a right line				3428.2749015355653
i should like to have seen his face at that moment that would have been difficult no matter replied de boville in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand francs no matter i can fancy it and he shouted with laughter				2200.133516611574
it is only for a moment and i know that i belong to you but remember that you are not to strike till i give the signal then he knelt down made the sign of the cross and lowering his face to the planks as if he would have kissed them said in a low tone in french comte de la fere are you there yes your majesty he answered trembling				24130.740269776234
she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise				295296.8804286113
no not that way i beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the hall				8998.881199411222

i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and i will take m ali as my model by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities				5000.217595627094
my god at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock rather than opened several men rushed into the chamber				859.32679998533
it was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes				17950.426395430906
the sudden departure of franz after being summoned by m noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of madame de villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing				255851.5119680731
this time d artagnan was not hasty				304429.5431335533
she would have taken d artagnan not only as her husband but as her god he was so handsome and had so fierce a mustache				74247.71466150838
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said				436.0705702367383
trust me said aramis do not expect to find anything in abbeville				322480.4638918974
in that case sir rejoined madame de villefort i will leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence to my wishes she then bowed to m noirtier and retired				778.9899035642331
the poor girl under the caresses of d artagnan lifted her head				547.0309314181335
he now saw where the breastplate was weak and prepared the blow				2584.180992786074
the two latter followed their captors in the humble guise of captives without arms				568.5276808599566

felton arrived at the palace of the admiralty covered with dust and streaming with perspiration				4196.430312194652
yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance and dantès knew that he had escaped the first peril				39408.45282422926
yes and as i am just now excessively annoyed i shall go from home				1337.2173615881236
tell the comte de la fere to come to me said madame de chevreuse i want to speak to him and i said the coadjutor want it to be thought that i do not speak to him				64.65053199786253

the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free				4586.2789123416
the monk				2993.4300600598617

the affair was not long i assure you				109.77375535875302
therefore in spite of olivain s remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him				84.7781804939389

parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened oh juxon said the king seizing the bishop s two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage				2466.122586961817
perhaps he will be young strong and enduring like yourself and will aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance				431337.27972752

she opened her eyes and saw the abbess accompanied by a young woman with light hair and delicate complexion who fixed upon her a look full of benevolent curiosity				2085.3531983867874
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwell s				1131.0631984832123
the fact was that none of his servants none of the travelers present could have gained anything by being possessed of this paper				1010.0596461607445

and we have just heard continued albert of a new deed of his and so heroic a one that although i have seen him today for the first time i request you to allow me to introduce him as my friend at these words it was still possible to observe in monte cristo the concentrated look changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion				3164.724005889169
and now my dear franz let us talk of something else				4605.419197656283

he left the saucepan				345831.1670313596
the hôtel then is far away at the other end of the town very well said milady and she resolutely entered the carriage				1231.9599285562717
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no				586.1407519532286
he did not move at the sound of the door and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre walls of his cell then raising his head he perceived with astonishment the number of persons present				3322.5951701850768

the coachman stooped down for his orders				2701.454267539294
it is not the king exclaimed the cavalier				8097.1743907064365
but since the end of the month m morrel had passed many an anxious hour				1563.4668712808589

but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal francs which i spent in four or five months it was not you who manufactured an italian gentleman for my father it was not you who introduced me into the world and had me invited to a certain dinner at auteuil which i fancy i am eating at this moment in company with the most distinguished people in paris amongst the rest with a certain procureur whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me just now it was not you in fact who bailed me for one or two millions when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place				869.6702266520193
