you he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about d artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it				84.69789329171888

mazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence the play of which had been nevertheless subdued by age and experience and d artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly sustained many a searching look very different indeed from those which were inquiringly directed on him at that instant				1018.7265357497839
by no means said d artagnan				4.83531756818126
furthermore d artagnan went with them leaving porthos at play with groslow				2729.2946290949276
i have been here since the morning				679.1438871161216
think often of raoul				1195.9454621016955
enough sir enough				1030.6145531013524
speak on said aramis				19.85318994027218
because said debray albert sent this morning to request us to come beauchamp and château renaud exchanged looks of astonishment				705.7535451742735
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and morrel saw villefort come out upon the steps followed by a gentleman in black				10394.360403231156
her name repeated the monk bending over him as if to tear from him the name if he would not utter it her name				941.0558656954149
oh he said i fancied this castle belonged to the ancient branch of orleans				9950.067990955124
d artagnan came to his relief with his whip in his hand				311.83347481665896
all the same i should like to do him that service what do you say to it i will tell the coadjutor said bazin				2855.292828370489
have you provided yourself with money				851.602529719989
why the devil				693.2372545068647
sure enough				1032.9658004696983
underneath a lamp in an inn anywhere they ask are you one of the fronde they unsheathe and that s all that is said				452.66954252986574
remember that was the only means				1706.9076190676556
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as much but it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness what you say is perhaps true they know my habits				6010.340760578832
old dantès who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleon s downfall				32319.520168713287
franz followed albert with his eyes and saw him mount the first step				2308.7092784400043
i should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times				2697.705766835971
the minister bowed his head and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out by the telegraph sire louis xviii				1931.3365589587036
certainly i was not the first captive that had been shut up in this splendid prison but you may easily comprehend felton that the more superb the prison the greater was my terror				984.2867121022599
porthos went before her and instead of a finger dipped his whole hand in				1111.515004666409
a doctor he was a merchant monsieur and had succeeded to the business of my poor father				545.6252227820262
you will need it this evening perhaps you will certainly need it to morrow raoul didn t wait to be told twice he knew that with superiors especially when those superiors are princes the highest politeness is to obey without delay or argument he went down to the stables picked out a pie bald andalusian horse saddled and bridled it himself for athos had advised him to trust no one with those important offices at a time of danger and went to rejoin the prince who at that moment mounted his horse				882.7499287020787
two horses that monsieur de tréville lends me at my pleasure and with which i am now going to take a ride to st germain well and what are you going to do at st germain then demanded athos				164.452542339436
but instead of obeying him the servants stood watching m d avrigny who ran to valentine and raised her in his arms				515.3040812495551
they breakfasted in haste and at six o clock had already gone ten miles				34355.09770792825
speak sir				235.42837045495554
oh ungrateful girl that i am cried valentine sobbing i will give up all even my dear old grandfather whom i had nearly forgotten no said maximilian you shall not leave him				67.73495698056696
at last they came in sight of a small wood and spurring their horses afresh rode in its direction				2519.1215183499853
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athos s compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it but said d artagnan it is the queen s diamond the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos				152.78857737834755
there was a shock which was perceived even in the royal carriage				1443.122926134511
the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had already said with respect to athos				88.93429804747429
it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dantès				516.5986629945814
besides by the faith of bonacieux you call yourself bonacieux interrupted d artagnan				65.40671714662874
thanks to this double gift and the spotless name that accompanied it m de tréville was admitted into the household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword and was so faithful to his motto that louis xiii one of the good blades of his kingdom was accustomed to say that if he had a friend who was about to fight he would advise him to choose as a second himself first and tréville next or even perhaps before himself				371.5436802253788
for all even for myself among the rest replied villefort				194.392320462277
now i belong to this last named class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain				17807.49110706942
as to the servant he had as we have said been with his master for five and twenty years therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for anything so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid				3027.9792117891475
dantès carefully collected the plaster carried it into the corner of his cell and covered it with earth				1573.2967467572987
who the beggar was that i killed ah				257.43553238046167
he was not deceived it was she whom he sought				5305.250424196477
and i said athos taking some small change from his pocket i you				163.58800038828775
i say that he is ill informed				7643.175022048628
to crown his happiness monsieur de chavigny had started on a journey that morning and in his absence la ramee was deputy governor of the chateau				5865.335909144792
athos was happy happy as he had never been before				1118.0223820963274
they dined apart from one another wherever they might happen to be or rather where they could				7103.150963149319
don t you see they are trying to catch your eye albert turned round just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness as for mademoiselle eugénie she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage				3370.4379352067417
the englishman was an original i had seen him conversing that morning with grimaud and grimaud had told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service				758.6646502906091
see planchet said he these gentlemen only say this out of affection for me but at bottom they all like you ah monsieur said planchet i will succeed or i will consent to be cut in quarters and if they do cut me in quarters be assured that not a morsel of me will speak it was decided that planchet should set out the next day at eight o clock in the morning in order as he had said that he might during the night learn the letter by heart				370.23690535242434
i say that valentine is dead replied d avrigny in a voice terrible in its solemn calmness				5410.248273900264
remember that the queen awaits you and after the queen the cardinal and after the cardinal myself d artagnan summoned anne of austria s servant and signified that he was ready to follow him into the queen s presence				1841.7556970839548
the young girl rose instantly but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death				726.6976568926673
desrues was however i must confess more skilful what would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we can				7918.600137994662
what ails you my dearest father				426.1028820538136
he went gayly up to the sailors who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency and desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in person but he trusts you will excuse him as very important business calls him to malaga so then gaetano said franz this is then all reality there exists a man who has received me in this island entertained me right royally and has departed while i was asleep he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you will use your glass you will in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew so saying gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail towards the southern point of corsica				3508.7374500209808
d artagnan related his story simply with the omission of names				4703.626188899892
did anybody order you to prevent that woman from singing				8845.057075680934
i know nothing can you not understand that monsieur d artagnan being my friend might take me into his confidence truly do you not perceive that i know all your abduction from the little house at st germain his despair that of his friends and their useless inquiries up to this moment				654.5261340079201
d artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu another interview was arranged for the following week				4247.151943121225
raoul delighted at the count s companionship perceived or affected to perceive nothing of this byplay				24690.360100721544
bazin quickly covered the table with a damask cloth and arranged upon it so many things gilded perfumed appetizing that d artagnan was quite overcome				8170.220612026847
he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the king s procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m morrel to be admitted				3850.0273576592003
the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray				1011.3203867938821
chapter xii				8958.721489383202
bring the prisoner in again said the cardinal				182.52336373095486
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry				1988.3157098371098
ah come in come in monsieur d artagnan cried the cardinal and welcome your friend too				1509.2237419578976
it was her first and on what an occasion				2460.4833617578806
that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth				8955.9622984339
lord de winter is only her brother in law i will see her d artagnan beware athos beware				10442.578885183992
what more well i i m not rich				6136.358522121692
well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you				163.51687544311048
it is enough				1189.4257088820732
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her				252.7353542862294
the next day at the appointed hour they went to see athos and found him and aramis in traveling costume				3591.739233937696
hold your tongue said he and let me answer				900.7050392211224
how delighted i am to have found you				154.09900293587285
faith said aramis laughing we have praised the dead enough let us revile the living a little i should like to say something evil of mazarin is it permissible go on go on replied d artagnan laughing heartily relate your story and i will applaud it if it is a good one a great prince said aramis with whom mazarin sought an alliance was invited by him to send him a list of the conditions on which he would do him the honor to negotiate with him				58.10690302393034
i have just killed an old friend indeed replied porthos who that poor count de rochefort well				599.8701750193391
she will soon get over these things so saying madame de saint méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a son in law s respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor renée				10989.684021541316
he was we repeat handsome young and bold he spoke of love like a man who did love and was anxious to be loved in return				926.7162243376406
it was almost impossible to see the shore from the boat they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from the shore				2487.8277764955474
the boat was built for speed her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like a bird				7092.009553555439
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated				17757.09043721314
baptistin will tell you where if you do not know their address				7935.935283579947
the drop of water rochefort had scarcely departed when mme				195.3367437694693
it was directed to monsieur oliver cromwell general of the army of the english nation ah said d artagnan a singular commission who is this monsieur oliver cromwell inquired porthos				144.7849141484347
as i before said i thought the whole thing was a joke nothing more				1291.3267349697755
the house of morrel son anyone who had quitted marseilles a few years previously well acquainted with the interior of morrel s warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change				4092.0488755305705
and so i did replied caderousse though once i confess i envied him his good fortune				885.9074710593411
one night twenty years ago my master fetched you from bethune and conducted you to armentieres i know you well now said the executioner you were one of the four grooms just so where do you come from now i was passing by and drew up at this inn to rest my horse				841.8853690285316
i have not said adieu to him a noise was heard like that the instrument of death would make if moved upon the block				26318.117199323395
once outside the city d artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood				5690.715046928661
the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth				1579.4778037128556
he strove to collect a band of followers and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone whom he hoped to surpass				24873.450833656032
how kind you are exclaimed the young man pressing his guardian s hand and i can set out immediately when you like raoul sir said raoul as he turned to leave the room i have thought of one thing and that is about the duchess of chevreuse who was so kind to me and to whom i owe my introduction to the prince and you ought to thank her raoul				1068.3439649154254
raoul did not doubt this was the gentleman and his escort he called out to him but they were too distant to be heard then in spite of the weariness of his beast he made it gallop but the rising ground soon deprived him of all sight of the travelers and when he had again attained a new height the ferryboat had left the shore and was making for the opposite bank				2832.945780190559
porthos lived in an apartment large in size and of very sumptuous appearance in the rue du vieux colombier				27165.510338679353
these two letters are the only ones i ever wrote to him				76.98350770215217
kitty said he i will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you like don t let that disturb you and he gave her a kiss at which the poor girl became as red as a cherry				28956.059631099244
there is a horse while on the contrary the hundred pistoles feed their master but how shall we get back upon our lackey s horses pardieu				2538.7593835582434
when i wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid				3087.6860271663263
at two o clock the tennis balls began according to grimaud s directions to take the direction of the moat much to the joy of la ramee who marked fifteen whenever the duke sent a ball into the moat and very soon balls were wanting so many had gone over				1846.430223741209
the telegraph m and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawing room and was still awaiting them there				904.9868886655627
dantès though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him				82.33899434776058
soon he saw the lights of la consigne				44641.23529462578
see i have sold my watch for francs and the guard and seals for				1161.868813850029
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong				10276.211861118305
but d artagnan remained impassible				23957.754221256284
that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today				3592.578542603565
morrel was seen carrying with superhuman strength the armchair containing noirtier upstairs				3083.2869168545617
but listen they appear to be speaking of me d artagnan drew near the window and lent his ear				3662.6148719466287
as he however had no other hat he picked up this as he ran and arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath				7495.085307239119
after breakfast two letters arrived for athos who read them with profound attention whilst d artagnan could not restrain himself from jumping up several times on seeing him read these epistles in one of which there being at the time a very strong light he perceived the fine writing of aramis				324.0757384573868
aramis he cried				1269.2749789595305
bravo said the captain				729.22607108806
said the inspector				5227.9187421161005
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life				572.3856539950879
have you any money the four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful				7516.194045963949
thomson french said he do you know this house monsieur they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world returned the count quietly				1469.3800606066727
a woman about six months after came to claim it with the other half of the napkin				14574.80284580745
no my lord these places are bought				58920.86874366163
danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through fear				1012.0415853575208
and smack of the puritan to a frightful extent said aramis				28.715283420696252
why for him and not for me				113.9637997308729
yes i understand my lord observes that there will be enough to go around we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke				1069.8284441173857
at drake s or aaron s one pays twenty five lire for common days and thirty or thirty five lire a day more for sundays and feast days add five lire a day more for extras that will make forty and there s an end of it i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a carriage then they must put horses to mine				1289.0885689899985
nothing sir it is a resolution which my father has taken and i know he never alters his mind				473.10303696505724
athos was a gentleman punctilious in points of honor and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady he was sure certain things that would not obtain the assent of this puritan				2562.641863959582
go on count said morrel you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world than ours there is something true in what you say said the count with that smile which made him so handsome i have descended from a planet called grief i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning for instance you told me to live and i did live you told me to hope and i almost did so				475.43961601790744

he was an italian and therefore superstitious				5401.860089935233
you will excuse me will you not				518.1936659100361
if you went to spain would you not see the bull fights				37740.25841017766
unfortunately for d artagnan among the spectators was one of his eminence s guardsmen who still irritated by the defeat of his companions which had happened only the day before had promised himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it				92.06319492645181
the other seemed to meditate yet he was more than half asleep				3241.1237482147994
two eggs and some fruit composed my repast then i drew another glass of water from my protecting fountain and drank it				85.65490085748566
as for you illustrious descendant of william tell you will straightway get together your clothes which are in my room and which annoy me and go out quickly to another lodging the swiss began to laugh boisterously				21960.563493678987
rather say that you have served as an instrument to that accursed woman but i swear to you that this crime shall be her last i don t know what you mean replied felton quietly and i am ignorant of whom you are speaking my lord				671.5395973903037
you will soon know but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation dantès trained in discipline knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent				1302.8014747062127
suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you suppose the poison was for instance brucine brucine is extracted from the false is it not inquired madame de villefort				453.6310933178561
yes i should expect so besides if they forget i shall take the liberty of reminding them the queen s voice				627.2353630263692
at the first glance and by the joy which was painted on his countenance the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot				1672.3580538453352
you do not belong to the human species you are a demon escaped from hell whither we send you back again ah you virtuous men said milady please to remember that he who shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin the executioner may kill without being on that account an assassin said the man in the red cloak rapping upon his immense sword				1129.2384905325218
well mother i yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the spahis added the young man lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self abasement				34618.8029811243
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak				1277.280782460186
if you like replied the latter				3064.198031870619
i am of a frankness of character quite french rochefort bit his lips in order to prevent a smile				620.1073076872823
i will so advantageously bestow piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for peppino and during that year another skilfully placed piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison and do you feel sure of succeeding pardieu exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french				3152.611400536288
the lemonade chapter				341.3662122521133
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of your fortune besides they say i am already rich in right of my mother too rich even				7907.107147520623
in the evening m de tréville attended the king s gaming table				702.5758054694711
mademoiselle eugénie said the maid retired to her apartment with mademoiselle d armilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer since then the maid had been below and like everyone else she thought the young ladies were in their own room madame danglars therefore went to bed without a shadow of suspicion and began to muse over the recent events				6463.0655272993545
you were right sir said anne				18369.835674470854
let me think a moment				659.3546029285667
don t try to understand it you will only lose your time you forgive me then sir said raoul and you will deign to tell me who is the person that you call the young indian certainly one of the most charming persons that lives mademoiselle frances d aubigne does she belong to the family of the celebrated agrippa the friend of henry iv				1143.5404907247262
two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man				226.89472883218258
d artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen were killed and as many rochellais what then the bodies were not plundered were they				3052.205282562055
morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant				4147.797527344544

she allowed therefore half an hour to pass away and as at that moment all was silence in the old castle as nothing was heard but the eternal murmur of the waves that immense breaking of the ocean with her pure harmonious and powerful voice she began the first couplet of the psalm then in great favor with the puritans thou leavest thy servants lord to see if they be strong but soon thou dost afford thy hand to lead them on these verses were not excellent very far from it but as it is well known the puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry				64242.62258252145

he gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and monte cristo passed a paper to albert				942.9824398006128

nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dantès the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmond s time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them				140.29756625810637

au revoir not farewell				17966.576742032343
that can only be to hold gloves he said				469.96690494850924
i succeeded a man of the most sublime genius that ever upheld the sceptre of france				800.0820759330788

i thought you would never come in what s the matter now planchet demanded d artagnan				39.41746995441249
i know the house where you heard it or one very similar to it a house with a garden a master a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths				51959.26535557276
who went out this morning athos asked uneasily				4009.844876501639
he had seen the two mortal enemies of the musketeers had seen mordaunt adjust the fuse he had heard the proverb which mordaunt had given in french				3293.2819264621166
and that one if i mistake not a lamprey just so				570.8883851498481
they sent him a magnificent supper and took his million				18121.72530861522
a sacerdotal officer				1500.9911272800425
he was however forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they employed				12669.572629798942
laporte place the king in bed laporte placed the king dressed as he was in the bed and then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet				10517.898881329003
and you are not afraid of that athos no replied athos it is not the search of mazarin that i fear now said aramis tell me a little what you do fear nothing for the present at least nothing in good earnest and with regard to the past asked porthos				128.59421117124057
night why for heaven s sake are your eyes like cats that you can see to work in the dark indeed they are not but god has supplied man with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions				2724.661574057068
he is a subtle conscienceless italian who though he very likely dreams of crime dares not commit it and unlike cromwell who disposes of both houses mazarin has had the queen to support him in his struggle with the parliament more reason then he should protect a king pursued by parliament the queen shook her head despairingly				12751.855674954482
does he still live inquired the innkeeper				9914.651336907995
nevertheless d artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage				18020.49333442892
i have never been understood and no wonder				2790.1716455423684
how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought gondy				2414.174215599508
comminges was near the queen who was questioning him upon the details of his expedition and every one was listening to his account when d artagnan and porthos were perceived at the door behind the cardinal				286.26898537872205
the proofs the proofs said the president remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs the proofs said benedetto laughing do you want proofs yes well then look at m de villefort and then ask me for proofs everyone turned towards the procureur who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of his nails				3405.9423647328167
he shall not come in before i am gone said he and when i am gone you can open to him but i ought to be gone too				1481.3784539288345
that is my failing a capital failing i admit but with that exception i am a good drinker athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d artagnan was shaken in his conviction				2517.7705186595126
the first impulse of these three and of those who last entered was to cast an inquiring glance at each other				998.6906054217097
ali mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared				1335.2357866312807
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive				22568.170483895734
we hope so answered the curates				47528.64169921777
go to				1615.1316434393427
albert led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite apartment				631.3610487383714
on the way we escaped				7840.3976311892875
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw la gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board				5330.928519713625
we have met him twice at general cromwell s				1044.3340428719985
pray speak of it for i shall not only i trust relate the little i do know but also a great deal i do not know it seems to me returned the count smiling that you played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened well you promise me if i tell all i know to relate in your turn all that i do not know that is but fair replied monte cristo				291.26775760172154
once taken they will be pressed when pressed they will confess everything				809.9332737201123
you believed that you would fly from me by returning to paris you believed that i would not dare to quit the treasure over which my master had charged me to watch				2054.42318040439
when they reached the steps raoul saw three horses				1873.6399821578102
i once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it tell it me sir formerly said the count i was athos madame de chevreuse looked astonished				1328.8884776618265
i will go straight to the louvre i will give in my resignation as captain of the king s musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal s guards and if he refuses me morbleu i will turn abbé at these words the murmur without became an explosion nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies				41613.57983660484

adieu madame				588.8345344158395
bonacieux in an undertone and now you may ruin us all my lord madame i ask a hundred pardons				16845.650351189604
how said bonacieux astonished				1754.7092298252705
the appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel				1300.7983259361472
this poor fellow whom caderousse had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his death he bequeathed this diamond to him but how did he obtain it asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned no monsieur but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in prison he fell sick and dantès took the same care of him as if he had been his brother the englishman when he was set free gave this stone to dantès who less fortunate died and in his turn left it to us and charged the excellent abbé who was here this morning to deliver it the same story muttered the jeweller and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true				1145.3315092991757
thanks my brave friend cried milady and when shall i be avenged tomorrow immediately when you please milady was about to cry out immediately but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward d artagnan				148.10902330760337
confiteor said caderousse putting the diamond on his little finger i was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller s shop it is another branch of industry paralyzed have you finished said andrea do you want anything more will you have my waistcoat or my hat				2103.737200105118

immediately and according to custom the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the pharaon has been built rigged and laden at the old phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city				1196.740113820959
villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others				689.2509516475262
ah cried the duke will you not accept any money from me i wish my lord would make me one promise what				550.1044585417337
ah yes continued caderousse and capital offers too but you know you will be captain and who could refuse you then meaning to say replied dantès with a smile which but ill concealed his trouble that if i were not a captain eh eh said caderousse shaking his head				418.13337350453304
mazarin turned again to his papers				2779.5946498798303
acknowledge that if albert is brave he can not be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise doubtless doubtless said morrel but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday you will breakfast with me will you not morrel said the count to turn the conversation				1521.7013036965343
it was necessary to separate				3490.4614613796425
from the ends of these two wings extended the park				6386.653821759428
well said he in a low voice				521.3029985327718
with whom with a child seven years old dear friend at raoul s age the heart is so expansive that it must encircle one object or another fancied or real				48354.65751079027
so much the better the more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied m				505.3012957986012
will this be permitted me certainly replied the officer and left the room				209.82671120143814
but the inflexibility of the procureur should stop there she would see him the next day and if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow				30572.583579281934
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush				11766.217105505055
i only ask you one favor and if you grant it me i will bless you in this world and in the next speak to the master madame said felton happily i am neither charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing				35160.3482113151
ah m de villefort cried he i am delighted to see you				178.35516217715335
once outside he and planchet set off as fast as they could and by making a long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate				1668.6962257152634
pierced hearts said athos				11.411921189262769
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances d artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once				2105.823762386795
master broussel is being killed				2172.8324438067257
for people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand his eminence had rarely recourse to such means				1717.6860250728978
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him				82.13371257189822
he had reserved the house and half the garden and building a wall between the garden and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden				1379.2751321130352
these steps came on came fast				34700.38012237165
chapter lxviii				19000.8254400111
say it then if i am in fault i will avow the error the grave and harmonious tones of that beloved voice seemed to have still its ancient influence whilst that of aramis which had become harsh and tuneless in his moments of ill humor irritated him				77.78103003461365
then he inquired about him and had the vexation of hearing that the prisoner played drank sang but that whilst playing drinking singing he often stopped short to vow that mazarin should pay dear for all the amusements he had forced him to enter into at vincennes				6074.719986057532
he stationed himself in a room commanding a view of the street pacing the chamber with restless steps stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious glance on ali but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation				4760.219451301954
the proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself with its thickly planted courtyard opening into the faubourg saint honoré and to the garden shut in by this gate which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen garden of about an acre				27715.73001599116
as d artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m de tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private audience				4671.7247121246555
see and she exposed her face completely to view see misfortune has silvered my hair my eyes have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim of purple and my brow is wrinkled				46228.514391225086
it is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it				99.54589949588492
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near				3346.1326717625566
you are good and faithful servants athos sprang from his horse gave the bridle to grimaud and advanced toward the window after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to go toward the door				351.66901985869663
d artagnan ran out and returned directly after				3241.5441482776882
so that now continued caderousse he owns a magnificent house no				683.6354531504949
you will find him quite enthusiastic upon what subject asked madame danglars				185.95644964005908
they left the chamber at the same time				350.8447904098836
to day i am engaged in a different affair				1754.3611927514187
i go out he said				319.3180627134958
a deathlike silence reigned in the room above				4832.5958149440385
you understand me said the count				153.51015888844108
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all				655.0394314893196
the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness				23847.948320601656
i supported myself by a chair feeling that i was about to fall but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak arms				516.3912918716698
but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered				577.3009042375694
tis he				115.13443270944971
sir he said there is one window of the convent lighted up hem				7951.814300475306
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to dantès				520.9511328134731
the monk doubtless feared that he would die without saying more for he exclaimed eagerly go on i know nothing as yet when you have finished your story god and i will judge oh father continued the executioner without opening his eyes as if he feared on opening them to see some frightful object it is especially when night comes on and when i have to cross a river that this terror which i have been unable to conquer comes upon me it then seems as if my hand grew heavy as if the cutlass was still in its grasp as if the water had the color of blood and all the voices of nature the whispering of the trees the murmur of the wind the lapping of the wave united in a voice tearful despairing terrible crying to me place for the justice of god delirium murmured the monk shaking his head				477.33480208131397
if one s lot is cast among fools it is necessary to study folly				10791.687581266387
d artagnan was thoughtful and seemed for the moment to have lost his usual loquacity				32042.08424598792
but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the power of conviction				2311.6427796543703
as for m de villefort he fulfilled the predictions of héloïse to the letter donned his dress suit drew on a pair of white gloves ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery and drove that same night to no				616.5274105684553
the rain of blood chapter				319.014899384158
five months after he had been separated from his son and almost at the hour of his arrest he breathed his last in mercédès arms				524.7736935113463
no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for the father s actions				4566.991687135706
a young priest with a simple and trustful heart performed the duties of the church of that convent				3268.797277054413
jesus seigneur				37972.65094395536
unfortunately said athos he whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united but where is such a lackey to be found not to be found cried athos				206.6652767338804
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized				10197.525380749521
for an instant he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to sea but he soon saw that she would pass like most vessels bound for italy between the islands of jaros and calaseraigne				48567.11166733139
he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue she a poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will she might at that very moment perhaps be preparing to die				1809.4534287505328
the duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing i know but added he seriously you understand it is on the king s service at your command lieutenant replied the musketeer who saw the business was a serious one				903.0289941186662
oh no edmond it is myself that i blame myself that i hate				13265.346467222938
yes said the procureur and i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary for i can not see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of valentine and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined wishes of her grandfather no no no replied the eye of the paralytic				9330.222105903276
blaisois a tall simple youth who understood nothing but what he was expressly told asked therefore for the abbé d herblay and in spite of bazin s assurances that his master was not at home he persisted in such a manner as to put bazin into a passion				1961.6627552942084
there he told the chief all his affection for the prisoner their promises of mutual fidelity and how every night since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins				19493.980857916322
do you expect news from him i expect himself himself				320.27738563052833
towards the evening of the third day				459.4988733406593
what unforseen events might not open his prison door and restore him to liberty				1660.6671355221326
blaisois went with him				69.51299608341091
morrel opened the door and closed it behind his son then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the pistols and pointed with his finger to an open ledger				42865.59878639008
i trust you have brought this rabble to reason madame replied the marechal i have left three men on the pont neuf four at the halle six at the corner of the rue de l arbre sec and two at the door of your palace fifteen in all				655.0050742048707
at least i hope so said the novice with an expression of joy which she made no effort to disguise				38651.310798404775
ah he s quite another sort of person a formidable gentleman indeed				1545.0279493430708
in the long run a man knows more about politics than a woman particularly such as like you monsieur bonacieux have conversed with the cardinal				226.03935768260854
they are not dead for the death of d artagnan would make a sensation				12452.967200830075
but by some strange play of emotion in proportion as the proofs that faria had not been deceived became stronger so did his heart give way and a feeling of discouragement stole over him				75.26773806125368
no madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends and porthos turning on his heel made a step to retire				2108.391896191577
not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity				25751.81761053081
ah said mousqueton who had ridden by the side of d artagnan without speaking a word on the journey you may think what you will sir but i can breathe now for the first time since my departure from pierrefonds and he put his horse to a gallop to announce to the other servants the arrival of monsieur du vallon and his friends				509.6232183807334
i know a man who will find the means of taking me from paris a man i have too long forgotten then falling into a reverie she added however with an expression of joy ungrateful woman that i am for twenty years i have forgotten this man whom i ought to have made a marechal of france				729.6820772621954
monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed over his lips then drawing near to ali he whispered remain here concealed in the dark and whatever noise you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you ali bowed in token of strict obedience				4913.002125433369
listen replied felton in a low voice				510.1714945324022
imprudent thrice imprudent no monsieur be satisfied nobody saw her replied d artagnan and he related to m de tréville how the affair came to pass				1948.9965011969925
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it				93.73950522854732
made tréville the captain of his musketeers who were to louis xiii				1093.8965018941826
it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a very simple thing				1605.0036496861333
do you not see returned the count that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his fellow sufferer does not perish with him				76.33977583198634
in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk and yet in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain d artagnan when awaking on the following morning had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth they had been so impressed upon his mind				510.3057965432773
he cast one lingering look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose faces seemed to smile and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors				26648.26378162165
no what i say replied bonacieux is only that i may know whether i am delaying you why that question my dear host asked d artagnan				81.62432074680478
this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted				3747.015528118916
albert de morcerf is no coward said monte cristo				118.51592055737578
weep said athos weep heart full of love youth and life				573.8365002301043
the abbé told us it was worth without the setting what was the abbé s name asked the indefatigable questioner				19469.12208532166
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance				32494.384070051507
but my mother no not my mother i mistake my father intends giving a ball a ball at this season summer balls are fashionable if they were not the countess has only to wish it and they would become so you are right you know they are select affairs those who remain in paris in july must be true parisians				14689.002372670053
come come give it to me				98.05713394464128
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish it you are inflexible				46966.45004649213
the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance two soldiers said d artagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out fine looking men upon my word said d artagnan				170.78983888848234
all at once he raised his head his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice				6411.277496699579
when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on one side into the corner of the landing place passed his quid from one cheek to the other stared stupidly with his great eyes and only acknowledged the squeeze of the hand which morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in return				918.5670867057252
the fowl had not been poisoned she had died of apoplexy				5143.197174240124
i would have saved madame de saint méran if science could have done it but she is dead and my duty regards the living				2280.4501651401433
i know all these things				1881.6451132068826
milady pale as a corpse endeavored to cry out but her swollen tongue could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it and resembled the rattle of a wild beast				9927.159190436318
pray tell me how i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oil here is my lamp so saying the abbé exhibited a sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations				34362.535844389255
now jump onto your horse and let us overtake the carriage this did not take long				2237.1101851963017
i don t know him				53.27116565132827
we have circumvented cromwell mordaunt and the sea but we shall find a certain difficulty in circumventing mazarin you forget replied athos that we consider ourselves your prisoners and not free from the engagement we entered into truly athos interrupted d artagnan i am vexed that such a man as you are should talk nonsense which schoolboys would be ashamed of				2114.6182154109724
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously				30203.35108844036
after the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl a piece of magnificence which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that they seemed ready to burst				35230.96935965276
yes her hand exclaimed everyone				29113.39196399639
and now said la ramee i must ask your highness s pardon but it seems that monsieur de chavigny is to be away for a few days and he has sent me word that he has certain directions to give me before his departure the duke tried to exchange a glance with grimaud but there was no glance in grimaud s eyes				394.0007022474938
for if you have discovered nothing at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions				2334.7643773439468
well asked peppino of his friend				757.8095713182661
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him				73.25676399549286
then a window was opened and when they saw and heard they were convinced				4635.125933576926
this threatening answer unluckily for the court produced quite a different effect to that which was intended				4110.165155901573
laporte assured himself by having it twice repeated of the accurate address and set off at a run				21626.53045290645

ventre saint gris monsieur de tréville as the king my father would have said				467.88406416861335
but all the italians are the same they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor the young man is better said danglars				380.2666317688543
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all ah exclaimed madame danglars alarmed what is there more to hear you only look back to the past and it is indeed bad enough				1081.391971307084
but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were ready and they were arising from table the stranger proposed to porthos to drink the health of the cardinal				291.21123595960034
yes my prince my prince interrupted d artagnan				47.97847980665564
having escaped these dangers they returned by the main road to boulogne at abbeville and followed it step by step examining every track				27043.45228617105
the young man rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in mademoiselle valentine s room and the servant who had replaced barrois ran in at the same moment				765.5229510861766
god has preserved us hitherto god will preserve us still yes we				6445.639741082415
well i shall look upon it as an expiation ah said d artagnan i know what you mean and i too added aramis but you must not think of that athos what is past is past i don t understand said porthos				133.71707722919882
go sir then said the queen you have obtained what you wish and we know all we desire to know scarcely however had the tapestry closed behind athos when she said to mazarin cardinal desire them to arrest that insolent fellow before he leaves the court your majesty answered mazarin desires me to do only what i was going to ask you to let me do				961.8791845379105
has the gascon been indiscreet she murmured to herself then said aloud d artagnan				17.411580560357397
this doublet and hose though new were creased like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a portmanteau				7474.214048049578
as we no longer wear the sword of the gentleman we may as well have the head of the puritan				2523.2137599993944
it is my happiness my treasure my hope				1485.4180668083632
what battle does it represent that of marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to francis i who has broken his				1544.8732444742393
athos therefore commanded bazin to fasten up his horse and that of aramis in the same manner				1031.4813178390452
let us see said d artagnan				5.100547670910392

to saddle gentlemen				1783.764307403284
what is this that m de villefort has been telling me demanded monte cristo and what incomprehensible misfortune incomprehensible is the word interrupted the procureur shrugging his shoulders				1312.953108763963
the women had already fled taking refuge in vitry only a few men remained				5064.676319643476
he has grown a good deal it seems to me and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place				945.290610860434

at nine o clock guided by planchet the little cavalcade set out taking the route the carriage had taken				1720.2269778432328
how asked blaisois i can				10170.224683831331
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look				1070.3315544593459
what would you not have accomplished if you had been free possibly nothing at all the overflow of my brain would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect				17230.403899229743
d artagnan flew to his hole laid himself down on the floor at full length and listened				2031.8027146791321
a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living				2278.5078029756273
dantès asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement				5239.013780665219
i have remarked also another thing said athos which is that in firing off your pistol you hold your arm too far outstretched				37334.02431491428
the hour came for him to retire				2071.6561318317786
the host remained standing in front of him looking with a kind of involuntary admiration at his handsome face combining both gravity and sweetness of expression				3309.4743184737163
how should he have been otherwise				4326.518860906976
the valet led felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies from la rochelle headed by the prince de soubise and introduced him into a closet where buckingham just out of the bath was finishing his toilet upon which as at all times he bestowed extraordinary attention				2118.690737659274
if on the other side it was not she which was still quite possible for the little light that remained rendered a mistake easy might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through the allurement of this woman for whom his love was known				2687.580530872767
each one on awaking would find himself on the field of battle				1673.4900076136055
i could almost believe myself at the café de paris murmured danglars				326.54555046973013
in the first place i warn you that that letter is for monsieur de tréville and it must be found or if it is not found he will know how to find it his threat completed the intimidation of the host				1105.7739557820983
a secret voice whispered to him at the bottom of his heart that he was but an instrument of vengeance that he was only caressed till he had given death but pride but self love but madness silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs				42502.010987353766
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer i am prepared for anything				1855.7352589354252
the soldier replied that he was and that he had given orders to be informed if the prisoner wished to speak to him				71.41513808050303
a flurry in stocks some days after this meeting albert de morcerf visited the count of monte cristo at his house in the champs élysées which had already assumed that palace like appearance which the count s princely fortune enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences				45740.24717428491
shall i go and offer her my services thought he				198.92478497541566
porthos was the first to speak				1301.2090088149519
with the first rays of day their tongues were loosened with the sun gaiety revived				4786.928517216711
it seems to me i did my duty				2652.125630340312
i have warned m danglars of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese				29430.373259565666
around this kind of rolling tent pressed a crowd of gentlemen and ladies				12624.849300836117
albert tottered and fell overpowered in a chair				1086.756109607601
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another				714.501558330002
listen for ten years i dreamed each night the same dream				1872.4324660181792
you might have taken lord winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage				2071.9633736682904
in our position one must provide for everything i shall try to gain the coast of france				780.6122327197506
but take no notice we know all about that well said porthos it appears to me that the means are very simple what asked d artagnan				146.2740937131935
did you forget that this great man this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to death prurigo and moreover my dear duke continued the minister of police we are almost assured that in a very short time the usurper will be insane insane raving mad his head becomes weaker				26265.863009506156
i also know that her name is valentine and i have already prayed for her thank you sir said d avrigny since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it				78.23352746211124
the count took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden box				1062.2599581701952
on the spot it had occupied was a circular space exposing an iron ring let into a square flag stone				2165.954408829367
the curate then entered followed by planchet				1210.8174617267628
he might fail but something must be left to chance				6602.276747836363
franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a sea gull on the wave continuing her flight towards corsica				3514.9501313456985
and dauphiné sir inquired the king of villefort				614.7686706664434
two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on				715.4916390636988
they set out after a run of two leagues mousqueton s horse sank				34985.68189616052
an affair for the police				4084.488955059489
if de wardes had at that moment been under his hand he would have killed him				70.89517200339928
if you can be satisfied with my dinner it consists of cooked tetragones and fruits what do you mean by tetragones asked d artagnan uneasily				3050.7822284206363
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime villefort tried to smile				558.5172111205102
take advantage of all and live happily and long				2164.168388546944
bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead				453.5889151873412
the next day they stopped at the hôtel de flandre at brussels				6775.276014948456
the governor then went out and words of pity fell on dantès listening ears mingled with brutal laughter				2263.7028812617464
i assure you i shall be very much in the way in that little boat said mousqueton				550.0923924027173
pardon me for having joined with your persecutors milady held out her hand to him				79.25535187449454
the memory of richelieu annihilates me				109.35491294904264
your feet too said grimaud				40.68366901971682
bonacieux saw that she had gone too far and she was terrified at having communicated so much				1466.1605797270063
was that all he said inquired athos				28.970965696363567
well beautiful lady very well said he but pardieu if you don t calm yourself i will design a second fleur de lis upon one of those pretty cheeks scoundrel infamous scoundrel howled milady				748.3139783808538
by degrees athos gave himself up to the charms of his reverie in the proximity of youth so pure so fresh				13594.710028000061
in devotedness or rather in fanaticism what his ordinaries had been to henry iii and his scotch guard to louis xi				4382.735836797753
he thought the carriage was about to stop there				885.5214508736277
sir he said turning to athos was it not in compassion to my timidity that you told me that this lady was the duchess de chevreuse and is she not the queen no vicomte said madame de chevreuse taking his hand and making him sit near her while she looked at him with eyes sparkling with pleasure no unhappily i am not the queen				411.5732889995037
yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to effect				1630.5166743124958
we shall see returned the other smiling				1002.6467006385394
monsieur said m de tréville we fancy that we have each cause to complain of the other and i am come to endeavor to clear up this affair i have no objection replied m de la trémouille but i warn you that i am well informed and all the fault is with your musketeers you are too just and reasonable a man monsieur said tréville not to accept the proposal i am about to make to you make it monsieur i listen how is monsieur bernajoux your esquire s relative why monsieur very ill indeed				1431.6268778201809
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets villefort went immediately				1313.9802566530361
you knew i should be killed on leaving this house and did not warn me no for i saw god s justice placed in the hands of benedetto and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence god s justice				2216.561639935128
whilst he was talking to this lad a horse was brought to the door of bazin s house				379.3287068451057
some one la ramee ran in haste to obey the call				6691.017744349019
it was evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him				75.02125210401603
porthos had his fits				41727.07698356025
indeed sir said he to albert if you are come to quarrel with this gentleman because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the case to the king s attorney you mistake sir said morcerf with a gloomy smile i am not referring in the least to matrimony and i only addressed myself to m cavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us				477.61826187099604
let them come on				532.4767598914616
ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived the one accompanied by the porter the other by ali and were received by the abbé busoni who was praying by the side of the corpse				1284.8174504796111
no no exclaimed debray that girl is not his wife he told us himself she was his slave				5492.34556953261
the woman s lips seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a word she uttered				2541.6833937182555
row porthos row and setting the example he plowed his oar into the sea two strokes took the bark on twenty fathoms further				2206.809641041953
for a time these wings supported him but when he reached a certain height this new aid failed him				76.58752613997522
ah dear constance i have found you then i see you at last and milady stretched out her arms to mme				176.6895310791844
twas too brief an enjoyment and la ramee felt that the gayety of heart he had regarded as the cause of health of which it was perhaps rather the result would not long survive such a mode of life				559.0903631098315
besides at that moment he put his foot on the first step of the ladder and began his descent				5656.022732811876
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a woman				530.2822259488405
he said he was going to the catalans and he is going to the city				1196.2129492199954
in the meanwhile as the thing is difficult to find in france and your abbé is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my account i must continue to use monsieur planche s anti spasmodics and mint and hoffman s drops are among my favorite remedies				36162.263454508015
coquenard understood it				68.7507294484159
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty				4323.161527016927
at half past three in the winter the fire was lighted by the discreet servant who had the superintendence of the little apartment and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same hour				1610.9973618253007
he will inform against you				151.3967896961074
besides there was no tranquillity in paris itself				2257.1409158657616
the two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and grimaud was posted as sentinel				3151.8869017473767
that is another thing said porthos				13.783075931253876
my dear m cavalcanti said andrea taking the major by the arm in a confidential manner how much are you paid for being my father the major was about to speak when andrea continued in a low voice nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me francs a year to be your son consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent the major looked anxiously around him				74.99138766105982
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them dantès sighed heavily				10236.461095059525
if anyone had said to your father at the moment he raised the pistol to his head if anyone had told me when in my prison i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three days if anyone had said to either of us then live the day will come when you will be happy and will bless life no matter whose voice had spoken we should have heard him with the smile of doubt or the anguish of incredulity and yet how many times has your father blessed life while embracing you how often have i myself ah exclaimed morrel interrupting the count you had only lost your liberty my father had only lost his fortune but i have lost valentine look at me said monte cristo with that expression which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive look at me				109.39428912344033
ah it is jacopo she said the captain of the yacht and she beckoned him towards them				134.54559696270488
ali appeared				768.459026362693

but drink some of this and the count took a bottle from his pocket containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the glass				981.1293439207155
milady was there as it were where you sit athos changed color				6035.165190575222
as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day d artagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails				3569.2233496969616
notary said she do you want a notary dear grandpapa the old man again signified that it was a notary he desired				6317.8298988412025
m noirtier although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent expression perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on business of an unexpected and official character				2699.4171767085804
where he was no one knew				4977.955121246027
d artagnan was conqueror without much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for form s sake				5727.405974775752
why did he not tell them he knew nothing about this affair he took care not to do so monsieur on the contrary he came up to me and said it is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and not i since he knows everything and i know nothing				658.5521018918992
are you sure that she is called so				413.9094223902652
i say that according to all probability i shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of la rochelle and that it would be far better that you should appoint there either monsieur de condé monsieur de bassopierre or some valiant gentleman whose business is war and not me who am a churchman and who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after matters for which i have no aptitude				27293.42869668148
alas yes said caderousse very uneasily				3027.742429155221
yes you				85.22398736872137
and provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine they will require no more of you nay perhaps you will even have a double reward i madame i cried felton				627.2787324492273
to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure				16602.17468603881
after passing through the porte saint denis athos looked at raoul s way of riding and observed take care raoul				1066.3143040679236
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme				195.72376665784412
he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till half past eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on it is likely well will you try and overtake him nothing i should like better if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty francs if not before louvres thirty and if we do overtake him forty said andrea after a moment s hesitation at the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise				4588.816427582019
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him				74.81837250631283
the woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this house she had scarcely closed the door after her when monte cristo appeared at the corner of a street so that he found and lost her again almost at the same instant				1022.8375938256964
he knows how to crunch fowls to dodge the huntsman and to find his way home by day or by night that s all				655.2024969903265
come in come in monsieur porthos the name of porthos produced its effect upon the clerks who began to laugh but porthos turned sharply round and every countenance quickly recovered its gravity				7575.613875379144
what a misfortune he had been informed at seven o clock in the morning that a rope ladder floated from one of the windows of the castle he had hastened to milady s chamber had found it empty the window open and the bars filed had remembered the verbal caution d artagnan had transmitted to him by his messenger had trembled for the duke and running to the stable without taking time to have a horse saddled had jumped upon the first he found had galloped off like the wind had alighted below in the courtyard had ascended the stairs precipitately and on the top step as we have said had encountered felton				775.4158510682681
that i believe answered m morrel but still he is charged with what inquired the elder dantès				463.5282712237878
there is nobody within said bonacieux				2344.4847598165097
but to return to our millions certainly said danglars in the most natural tone in the world				703.9856179780517
you know my opinion of my mother count look at her still beautiful witty more charming than ever				1655.9543034356052
i shall go and die by his side madame madame exclaimed de winter your majesty abandons yourself to despair and yet perhaps there still remains some hope no friends left my lord no other friends left in the wide world but yourself				1699.2228737169416
do you think you have to do with galley slaves or novices in the world				715.4684396758275
the host shook his head				496.6486732028795
anne of austria had never appeared more brilliant than on that day radiant with grace and wit				10481.35065620314
i am always prepared to go only as you know i never do go and perhaps shall go this time as little as before in short if i go will you go too i will try you torment me giulio with your fears and what are you afraid of then of many things what are they mazarin s face smiling as it was became clouded				19344.97083288456
without the loss of an instant the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers embarked without delay				5330.415063511559
my horses said monte cristo				93.03317252329812
i claim then the right to choose my opponent				10268.688094381096
he too ten years ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly				62096.66265576668
the count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which bertuccio had brought in haste				1358.5332705112655
rely on me to procure you the other i will do my best ah m morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owner s hand m				590.45967083693
monsieur bertuccio you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at auteuil bertuccio slightly started				1141.16661653954
speak the window was again opened slowly and the same face appeared only it was now still more pale than before				1162.7805379376534
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him				76.67229890748281
you would love me then if you were not queen				487.631005149726
well said he they likewise have refused me that dear friend is because nobody is more worthy than yourself he took a quill wrote the name of d artagnan in the commission and returned it to him				72.37654523567295
the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal				6252.090443933952
thank god i have never heard his name mentioned by any person and i hope and believe he is dead do not think so bertuccio replied the count for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watch care to make of them instruments of his vengeance so be it responded bertuccio all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again				368.68939731455185
except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to decipher them i am very ignorant of heraldry i a count of a fresh creation fabricated in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary				4725.585582895429

my friend who was seigneur of the country might have seduced her or taken her by force at his will for he was master				1400.043244112479
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets				4799.343592754468
but d artagnan at the same time being a man of extreme caution was quite aware what injury he should do himself if by any indiscretion or awkwardness he should betray has manoeuvering to the experienced eye of athos				240.6833961361384
just think				3810.6531264163473
a blasphemy				23554.067328247664
as he was finishing the sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard				1502.659701067289
he was a simple looking lawyer s clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener				37229.067639349814
the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair				1032.9406803948254
alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good then he said aloud listen morrel i see your grief is great but still you do not like to risk your soul morrel smiled sadly				3430.855474432188
i would confide my life to them but i should hesitate ere i trusted them with your majesty s well said athos since you have not a regiment we are three devoted men				774.3509718223554
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him				77.4518230533902
he found outside the door the old servant to whom valentine had given directions				5742.172593993332
milady sat down to table ate from several dishes drank a little spanish wine and felt all her resolution return				897.8551692208752
you who never interest yourself in politics ah				297.55315468888443
i do not feel remorse because had we allowed her to live she would have persisted in her work of destruction				6997.883583512173
porthos turned his head to the right and to the left and drew himself up with a movement full of dignity				2650.435356149693
stay with grandpapa maximilian i promise you not to persuade them to stay morrel watched her as she left the room he heard her ascend the little staircase which led both to madame de villefort s apartments and to hers				9036.135332872145

she was dressed that is to say in dishabille wrapped in a long warm dressing gown				24446.173348458695
i think it will be wise to set off said d artagnan				6.244767765474529
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained				5543.473600261993
the king followed by the three friends turned his steps that way				702.5637450599687
the queen had at first positively refused but at length became afraid that the duke if exasperated would commit some folly				10828.946155263613

i was sure of it the cursed letter don t be afraid you idiot there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed d artagnan i will go without you				155.6506538415109
and you porthos continued the count as if in consideration for d artagnan s embarrassment you the best heart the best friend the best soldier that i know you with a soul that makes you worthy of a birth on the steps of a throne and who sooner or later must receive your reward from an intelligent king you my dear porthos you a gentleman in manners in tastes and in courage you are as culpable as d artagnan porthos blushed but with pleasure rather than with confusion and yet bowing his head as if humiliated he said yes yes my dear count i feel that you are right athos arose				2118.9362476071146
he addressed about twelve words to him grimaud answered in four				2317.758573353229
if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france				805.451821553876
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting father you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques no				594.1261298625733
i really must pray you to excuse me but in truth i was not attending to the conversation marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young people alone let me tell you on one s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics never mind dearest mother said a young and lovely girl with a profusion of light brown hair and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal tis all my fault for seizing upon m de villefort so as to prevent his listening to what you said				503.04194742020974
lake maggiore				44344.215411635116
among these thousands moved in bands numbering from one hundred to two hundred pale and haggard men clothed in rags who bore a sort of standard on which was inscribed these words behold the misery of the people wherever these men passed frenzied cries were heard and there were so many of these bands that the cries were to be heard in all directions				5639.143163011575
this time i have merely come from cadiz you have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit				1528.0461126471093
no you do all this not i still it seems to me that as you profit by it danglars shrugged his shoulders				1262.7377549120959
oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm remain said caderousse				314.9226223547228
i am pleased with one place and stay there i get tired of it and leave it i am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish				1615.9443611424335
franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a dream				1825.3625104262678
it is he whom we must warn				65297.31271440926
i hoped in silence				714.4010586353423
the secret cave the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the rocks which seemed themselves sensible of the heat				50713.24577414582
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eels all light wholesome food suitable for the sick but the wine said d artagnan who furnishes the wine				1144.2992304191878
the minute hand moved on				585.7261300325714
la jeune amélie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica				3494.944853908806
m de morcerf went out about half an hour ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation i am ready my son said mercédès				1430.7642645488431
one fine morning then his yacht followed by the little fishing boat boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence on the never to be forgotten night of his departure for the château d if he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither				10656.301728735894
besides it came into the young man s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair				1761.391340589242
and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking glass				970.2483139220573
move monsieur move away i entreat you you are exactly in the spot what spot where he fell my dear monsieur bertuccio said monte cristo laughing control yourself we are not at sartène or at corte				39053.996785380994
i said my good fellow that i would do more single handed by the means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos pistols carbines and blunderbusses included				5447.353897057183
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back				1328.621732143483
sir said beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from paris at this moment and can not justify himself i accuse no one sir said danglars i relate and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you does the count know what answer you received yes i showed it to him did he know my father s christian name was fernand and his family name mondego yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less				3973.687709993712
in twenty four hours he was attacked by a fever and died three days afterwards				22796.902697335307
i slept here last night and the night before and you know it is not my custom to sleep three times in the same bed then said mordaunt your honor gives me my liberty for to night and even for all day to morrow if you want it				89.36752135838363
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honoré				13419.167226498608
porthos however found that he had no straw left for himself				403.1180435747015
there was neither dining nor playing at cards nor dancing in that house				391.342273820471
his situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one				818.9601854483211
• you provide in accordance with paragraph f a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within days of receipt of the work				1262.7178850991022
well am i to rush into his arms and strain him to my heart crying my father my father like monsieur pixérécourt do not let us jest gravely replied bertuccio and dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it bah said andrea a little overcome by the solemnity of bertuccio s manner why not because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be the father of such a wretch as you oh these are fine words and there will be fine doings if you do not take care menaces i do not fear them				121.28485547350368
well then since she has left paris and you are sure of it d artagnan nothing prevents me and i am ready to follow you				177.6811707100932
athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine				1133.3560664611896
god knows how much i love revere you see that you forget nothing said athos appearing to look about him that he might hide his emotion				3146.2889304702644
really said planchet				290.0528125956399
throwing down his spit and ordering his wife to do the same with her broom handle and the servants with their sticks he set the first example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter				732.1067120241896
the cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of his terrible emissary for he comprehended the strange qualities of this woman sometimes a serpent sometimes a lion				8622.414575686647
this was not however a rope ladder but a ball of silk cord with a narrow board which was to pass between the legs the ball to unwind itself by the weight of the person who sat astride upon the board				5136.040952259028
monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me you have then seen something replied d artagnan				70.83333500937698
dearest dearest valentine exclaimed he forgive me if i have offended you and forget the words i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain no maximilian i am not offended answered she but do you not see what a poor helpless being i am almost a stranger and an outcast in my father s house where even he is seldom seen whose will has been thwarted and spirits broken from the age of ten years beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me oppressed mortified and persecuted day by day hour by hour minute by minute no person has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself				1600.8983463488291
sir monk said de guiche confess well that brave man and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule all is paid thanks monsieur said the monk with one of those smiles that made bragelonne shudder				3779.0012801922785
at each cross path was an orchestra and tables spread with refreshments the guests stopped formed quadrilles and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased				1519.5456121761658
it was indeed mousqueton mousqueton as fat as a pig rolling about with rude health puffed out with good living who recognizing d artagnan and acting very differently from the hypocrite bazin slipped off his horse and approached the officer with his hat off so that the homage of the assembled crowd was turned toward this new sun which eclipsed the former luminary				44221.61750326605
as soon as i have done i will knock on one of the panes of glass				980.4764581025901
i went to work				1212.1906310583022
oh i am very presuming i am aware				89916.54054246217
at that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as tréville				1080.3580762282547
to morrow according to all probability we shall attack the enemy but my lord said marshal de grammont consider that when we have collected all our forces we shall have hardly thirteen thousand men monsieur le marechal said the prince with that wonderful glance that was peculiar to him it is with small armies that great battles are won then turning toward the prisoner take away that man he said and keep him carefully in sight				4084.0994464117953
bah said porthos why separate since we are all together because you can and ought to return to france your mission is accomplished but ours is not your mission is not accomplished exclaimed d artagnan looking in astonishment at athos				201.45265478930276
and nothing more				1120.3395637066365
nay if your excellency is satisfied it is all that i could wish				1610.7592425698667
it is no nonsense it is quite true				1159.4745839663415
d artagnan arrived at the bastile just as it was striking half past eight				7216.812301302285
so you would rob the count of monte cristo continued the false abbé				1087.6488262750654
only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel well perhaps				2666.637638962115
that is of the first importance attend to it then at once unfortunately it is a thing that i can t perform at any time i choose				13710.57586927814
well my dear sir said danglars to fernand here is a marriage which does not appear to make everybody happy it drives me to despair said fernand				1330.0473193502664
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful				3730.905491793581
and yet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness such as franz had never before witnessed in them his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity				2657.3815838316114
and if i do not possess that talent which your smiles prove to me you doubt should i not still have that ardent love of independence which will be a substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self preservation				48655.611751132084
he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished				10251.623325176988
what are we to do maltese asked the captain				712.4609539021768
if that is really so how came you in the bastille how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i don t know myself but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high treason of high treason cried bonacieux terrified of high treason				4307.309296836542
we have had great annoyances there				759.8688170018372
athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing				386.5460750544074
from that time i looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose				1523.3173551077118
oh it is not yet fixed murmured fernand				1382.5193784276892
at the beginning of this work his servant notwithstanding orders to the contrary came to his room				187.44861831195917
and monsieur de nogaret de la valette what do you say of him				82.65503257272798
i have told you my wish or rather my determination				11722.289999854562
pray was not monsieur d artagnan in the time of the cardinal mixed up in some intrigue from which he came out according to report quite cleverly my lord as to the report you allude to guitant perceived that the cardinal wished to make him speak out i know nothing but what the public knows				4661.6932427940055
those devilish scotchmen are always thirsty				37681.709035436805
no no i wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount it is tiresome to be always acting manfred				43236.62625196686
franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying alas said morrel with a feeling of selfish joy for he thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely				64265.29520190569
athos on the other hand reflected that this recent gentleness of his friends most certainly arose from some plan formed by d artagnan				152.84534217665396
not only was the first gendarme still there but the young man now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the foot of the staircase the only one by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great street door which alone afforded the means of egress				25150.743707657257
still continued the procureur looking at the doctor with uneasiness if you wish it if you demand it why then it shall be done				1695.6776707512968
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive				25490.398450969096
yours affectionate de tréville well this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow me athos to the waters of forges there or elsewhere in the king s service either the king s or the queen s				1087.577257500019
a globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling casting a strong light into my chamber and i perceived with terror that a man was standing within a few paces of me				124.63207789409076
let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen				13881.190812710694
you see it makes a very respectable appearance pardieu cried d artagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinal s money you are an amiable and charming young man said mme				103.77773944787853
the unknown chapter				330.9491571580422
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve oh				993.7426707126647
cæsar poisoned at the same time escaped by shedding his skin like a snake but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger s				1135.9135427197236
but to you at least m debray i need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known				2716.982333613785
it is best to constitute myself at once a prisoner with athos who is already arrested and with d artagnan who most probably will be gascon headed man will you have done said the king				485.30971434529323
from that moment i have neither seen nor heard anything d artagnan entirely overcome by this terrible story remained motionless and mute while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart				414.6312314874022
fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised then you were aware of dantès being engaged in a conspiracy not i				839.1763888053869
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m morrel left on old dantès chimney piece and which you tell me is still in your hands caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt				8895.949716795398
the signatures were perfectly legal				64791.94550440705
anne of austria looked with a sort of terror at the threatening aspect of the cardinal his physiognomy in such moments was not destitute of a certain grandeur				42801.955319087065
penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his master s daughter mademoiselle julie and had never been able to change the name to madame herbault				16133.390001632395
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together				789.63158324144
alas sir in the most unexpected manner				982.4218978690016
then rising he went out and meeting a servant on the stairs he asked where is m de villefort the servant instead of answering pointed to the garden				1378.680051403018
it was then three o clock in the morning				725.1932557695649
madame du vallon left things in much disorder i am not much of a hand at figures so that i live almost from hand to mouth he is afraid i have come to borrow money thought d artagnan				143.99657362252378
he did not wear the uniform cloak which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence but a cerulean blue doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water ripples in the sun				2971.965388075489
good morning my dear host cried d artagnan				7.054726379470008
now said planchet let us thank the queen				491.085418030336
it is true that this provincial was a gascon and that particularly at this period the compatriots of d artagnan had the reputation of not being easily intimidated				15601.997473446505
yes a chef d oeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied athos				35.34412350754481
put him to death franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window				718.9680810448668
d artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night				1120.1045317684668
to whom is it addressed to monsieur noirtier rue coq héron paris had a thunderbolt fallen into the room villefort could not have been more stupefied				5748.698408952471
when d artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve o clock was striking				6520.505707125627
there you must find the curate or if he is not at home go to the convent of the augustines which is the last house on the right and bring me one of the brothers				2539.3441585292485
d artagnan lost no time in useless compliments				13847.91038563438
i confess it replied albert				170.11977414575895
my fair friend said athos allow me to tell you that everybody is tired of war				2174.516738046497
andrea was supported by two priests				13834.855417110744
but what ails you				114.92649338666084
d artagnan s plan was very simple				6689.263185197115
but continued the porter he would not take them andrea turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible				26590.53549959086
all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house occupied himself with the study of natural science				35386.741091364005
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir i have full and perfect confidence in him				79.32783206249213
you have known me long enough continued albert biting his lips convulsively for he saw that beauchamp s anger was beginning to rise you have been my friend and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point if i have been your friend morcerf your present manner of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title				3693.8871978931584
the sailors looked at one another				720.5406485972843
as the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of meeting				3574.9771300626144
it is easy to suppose that morrel s agitation would not escape the count s penetrating eye				1545.7582180682057
where are we going inquired aramis are we going to fight perchance				44929.87410672239
the young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment and to be branded				12121.66971330563
now you are exactly what i dreamt you were the man i always loved				2709.561165737667
upon a word from her i would betray my country i would betray my king i would betray my god				425.28241260388774
during this time madame morrel had told her son everything				774.1800328889187
it was at perugia on corpus christi day in the garden of the hôtel des postes when chance brought us together you madame de villefort and her son i now remember having had the honor of meeting you i perfectly well remember perugia sir and the hôtel des postes and the festival of which you speak said madame de villefort but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to mind that i ever had the pleasure of seeing you before it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed valentine raising her beautiful eyes to the count				190.92535747420257
i will call thee mouston and if it makes thee happy i will not tutoyer you any longer oh cried mousqueton reddening with joy if you do me sir such honor i shall be grateful all my life it is too much to ask alas thought d artagnan it is very little to offset the unexpected tribulations i am bringing to this poor devil who has so warmly welcomed me will monsieur remain long with us asked mousqueton with a serene and glowing countenance				1135.8924187305006
for a man who like franz viewed his position in its true light it was a grave one				923.6761389497851
at intervals he listened to learn if the noise had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the prisoner who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for liberty as himself				355.836440183554
we have the gates the gates				10356.670912261276
where are your musketeers				1151.1214899511847
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt				1929.0889493371646
m de tréville who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection never ceased recommending him to the king				566.9910253761905
as for d artagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him				78.99550597907083
it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs				26234.870548971387
morrel bounded to the door opened it and found valentine stretched out at the bottom of the stairs				2730.7330871768636
give way at these words the man with a pistol and sword raised his head but it was too late				3032.585715578031
ah this time you can not lose ground my fine friend exclaimed d artagnan				15.026581719237033
he therefore promised albert that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the windows of the rospoli palace				1484.3361747279796
and by whom were they recommended to you oh by the house of fenzi one of the best in florence i do not mean to say you will lose but nevertheless mind you hold to the terms of the agreement would you not trust the cavalcanti i				793.8027939988701
as to conditions you would soon see how moderate and reasonable we are come now what are your conditions rest yourself first my lord and we we will reflect i do not need rest gentlemen i need to know whether i am among enemies or friends friends my lord				621.7950344214881
the king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him				80.86462734955276
and the other asked athos				15.2008868159109
not exactly it is the wine that was sent by your order on our account said the three musketeers				1081.3780489040955

sir said d artagnan you will go and release your companion who is guarding the coachman				3674.6503227065787
although it was impossible that valentine should see him hidden as he was he thought he heard the shadow at the window call him his disturbed mind told him so				455.59204315361717
andrea s hand left his pocket inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some time				359.6740182250483
all at once she heard a tap at her window and by the help of a flash of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars				19396.252558444372
the executioner took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat				1537.6305603259816
well since there is another finer and younger why you may take the old one and let us drink what asked the host quite cheerful again				367.8026511351017
i opened the door of the ante room myself and i saw you enter at the end of the corridor because i was shown up the private stairs how so i know not it must have been a mistake mazarin was aware that it was not easy to make d artagnan reveal anything he was desirous of hiding so he gave up for the time the discovery of the mystery the gascon was concealing				31331.038799521644
i think i hear a noise she said leave me good bye for the present replied the count walking upon tiptoe towards the library door and smiling with an expression so sad and paternal that the young girl s heart was filled with gratitude				2258.3854485331776
will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn				896.1677811697788
i thought i had crushed you madame but either i was deceived or hell has resuscitated you milady at these words which recalled frightful remembrances hung down her head with a suppressed groan				1905.239342647234
as my grandfather used to say i once reigned in paris				505.8803807007507
you do not know with whom you have to deal peppino made a sign and the youth hastily removed the fowl				6408.465549016982
cloud and not elsewhere before the d estrées s pavilion and not in another street				1568.2365078446044
immediately several men appeared who unharnessed the smoking horses and put the carriage into a coach house				394.9289530495964
when a thing suited him he paid the price demanded without thinking to ask for any abatement				68489.56023868902
i mentioned your diamond then to my adversary who had likewise remarked it				68.78125710625365

i understand wait a little porthos before crying out for on my word you haven t reached the end said the gascon in a jesting tone				755.4608187413114
porthos called him drunk and the stranger drew his sword				1129.4323538056572
none of those interesting adventures fell in his way the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their husbands at least to their lovers and thought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity				15195.572540218802
the former dantès proposed to augment the latter to remedy				37310.1057559873
what do you say i say that love is a lottery in which he who wins wins death				705.2173209396193
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed				2411.3612499973556
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat				2338.9296127464568
mordaunt made several strokes more and raising his arm in sign of distress above the waves pity pity on me gentlemen in heaven s name				902.4650871701997
every door was opened to him				70.60359273479999
albert expected to have something new this time to show to the traveller but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy to see that each name was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him				78.20257072654755
i can not answer for the queen				486.23045614691557
madame de villefort has nothing of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed				43092.87780190518
the soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps				1491.1166390830688
poor fellow remarked danglars affecting to pity the young man from the bottom of his heart				435.25477490322305
each retired to his own apartment				725.2596522344235
with the entrance of m morrel danglars and caderousse were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste				1350.1746262580016
i the offspring of a noble family who placed reliance upon your friendship i was near dying of my wounds at first and of hunger afterward in a beggarly inn at chantilly without you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters i addressed to you but monsieur porthos murmured the procurator s wife who began to feel that to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time she was wrong				1323.5315413426056
and desirous of putting an end to the interview he pushed by her and closed the door as if to exclude the pain he felt				8341.34918563554
albert listened trembling now with hope then with anger and then again with shame for from beauchamp s confidence he knew his father was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence				4242.982079734882
although d artagnan was not of a very sentimental character the mercer s pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart				433.3813603162327
i desire to know if the confession of charles stuart is at an end said the stranger				1887.221621224665
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money				1026.8506597433461
brucea ferruginea				83593.03137522748
do you bring me tidings of my guardian have you not received any said d artagnan to the youth				4485.420180117113
i know them from having heard one of their friends monsieur d artagnan say a great deal about them you know monsieur d artagnan cried the novice in her turn seizing the hands of milady and devouring her with her eyes				348.68598227956954
to this preoccupation of his vanity d artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish				44118.7087396717
my death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger laporte burst into tears				2859.5507178265966
mon dieu				4064.644165278712
are you coming morrel directly i have given my card to the count who has promised to pay us a visit at rue meslay no				570.3915263178034
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving king of france excited universal enthusiasm glasses were elevated in the air à l anglaise and the ladies snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the table with their floral treasures				18874.511693642304
monsieur du vallon that worthy gentleman for with the exception of yourself monsieur d artagnan there s not a man in france that i esteem and love so much as him then my lord replied d artagnan pointing to the purse which mazarin still held if you love and esteem him so much you understand me be it so				528.2533893667828
athos followed him before the felucca rose again on the waves the cable which tied the boat to the vessel was then seen plainly rising out of the sea				1130.9068027380997
let him have it let him have it she said				349.6680019624998
she pointed to each letter of the alphabet				34361.65104774791
it was mousqueton who was obeying his master s command				4484.898339612384
keep up the dance then since he will have it so				638.5179817038011
the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she but less preoccupied by that pretty face than d artagnan he had fancied he saw a second head a man s head inside the carriage				1360.6973458575296
so then so then pack up our luggage planchet and let us be off				1206.7021012268726
yes said groslow bursting with his usual coarse laugh i know you frenchmen want nothing but cuts and bruises charles had heard and understood it all				577.8434577162183
she stopped astonished then the voice reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of maximilian				3172.9348601834226
mazarin contemplated these proceedings with a thoughtful glance				4776.704338571548
at the moment he entered the vestibule another man was entering likewise dusty out of breath leaving at the gate a post horse which on reaching the palace tumbled on his foreknees				30074.64108614861
they heard the horsemen pass under the windows				1267.6473294150242
i congratulate you				61.20633271758885
what do you mean grimaud he exclaimed				1478.9808360381912
but what do i see in the water something struggling oh yes exclaimed raoul fixing his glance on one point in the stream splendidly illumined by the setting sun a horse a rider they are sinking cried olivain in his turn				894.4549877342466
and then besides the useless blood				1186.3036146102656
yet i let him die				1424.5007102400543
in the last case i must wait for daylight to renew my search				2710.284793237961
it is well madame said mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer d artagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger				2151.6335433615777
oh no he exclaimed not die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much				1502.171111161579
the ball was not a musket ball it was an arquebus ball				4007.914177990393
but to you d artagnan i am i hope still dear athos your comrade your friend				664.7928438552499
come in said monte cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least emotion and immediately beauchamp appeared				835.4703994175675
that astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in carlini s rear when he fell				2013.8946359043052
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical				36498.51366818219
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart				426.8471763208208
he was in a small room which franz had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans				21485.46606447059
just what you please you may speak of her country and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence oh said albert it is of no use to be in the company of a greek if one converses just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of the east do so then for of all themes which you could choose that will be the most agreeable to her taste albert turned towards haydée				3003.0345653376494
i see her now as on her knees at my feet with her head thrown back she begged for life				520.7248814892707
oh yes i assure you count they want nothing that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each other and with twenty five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum however replied monte cristo with a tone so sweet and gentle that it went to maximilian s heart like the voice of a father but they will not be content with that				711.6654160161193
a groom was rubbing them down near them were saddles and bridles				70224.35948304263
milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king				624.6380817882497
instead of a rude mixture of sailors soldiers and those belonging to the humblest grade of life the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper s reign officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condé and younger members of families brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god				570.6143246128329
then seeing the young man was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out albert said he a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback will refresh you we will then return to breakfast and you shall attend to your affairs and i to mine willingly said albert but let us walk				9004.289485119682
now one evening when d artagnan who was in the trenches was not able to accompany them athos porthos and aramis mounted on their battle steeds enveloped in their war cloaks with their hands upon their pistol butts were returning from a drinking place called the red dovecot which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to jarrie following the road which led to the camp and quite on their guard as we have stated for fear of an ambuscade when about a quarter of a league from the village of boisnau they fancied they heard the sound of horses approaching them				138.58637246455902
felton darted into the palace				1480.752030641289
in the courtyard the carriage and the four musketeers were ready but he looked around in vain for his friend				791.2549457557362
when the game was over the duke laughing at la ramee for his bad play offered these men two louis d or to go and drink his health with their four other comrades				2808.1961132478687
yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium				3559.5218944059025
and they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing				56279.44233142605
i beg you to return me that dispatch d artagnan obeyed and mazarin ascertained that the seal was intact				51581.17679466359
the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman has his letters stolen from him by means of a traitor a brigand a rascal has with the help of this spy and thanks to this correspondence chalais s throat cut under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry monsieur to the queen				521.0932420594247
d artagnan porthos and aramis uttered a cry of joy				1994.552610583037
god of goodness				7827.129388670227
men of the robe and men of the sword on the day after these events had taken place athos not having reappeared m de tréville was informed by d artagnan and porthos of the circumstance				4375.606888714486
it is magnetism she says and when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen she assures me				81.302530937488
bonacieux let us fly				3293.6776807562787
they never overtook the chimerical friend yet andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay horse and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the road to the low countries and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every step				2253.4802010222866
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept				2081.646487636243
planchet all astonishment was busy grooming them and had already finished two				1337.071988727389
ah he exclaimed it is thou who wouldst have him assassinated				4596.858235888434
what ails you said he at length				10107.221423383959
he is walking about and thinking thought d artagnan but of what				686.8129975774829
besides milady knew the masters and did not know the lackeys on the contrary the lackeys knew milady perfectly				4565.114885703345
i am haydée the daughter of ali tepelini pasha of yanina and of vasiliki his beloved wife the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young woman the brilliancy of her eye and her highly important communication produced an indescribable effect on the assembly				2958.3100833392655
be reasonable				7861.046854004144
mousqueton groaning slipped from his horse his wound not allowing him to keep the saddle				2760.4200568235674
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm				1192.1995264246234
you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day and yet i was not aware that you had married fernand my calumniator and that my father had died of hunger can it be cried mercédès shuddering				3275.5096179791017
to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well				637.401861196193
perhaps said athos but at all events listen well to this				1328.1320988960736
so long as you are not mine valentine i shall always think i may lose you oh replied valentine with a convulsive movement oh indeed maximilian you are too timid for an officer for a soldier who they say never knows fear				1074.8830213690057
all at once felton stopped				1059.0771739572742
that sigh was the soul so chaste and so loving which reascended to heaven				841.8749315953328
in a month then on your honor if i am not consoled you will let me take my life into my own hands and whatever may happen you will not call me ungrateful in a month to the day the very hour and the date is a sacred one maximilian				2937.643494914137
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet				981.7016777981667
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but to day is not the proper time to day flatter and caress or you are only a common woman at the first words of this address d artagnan had seized porthos s arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force				1741.9126119247067
she blushed and that she might not answer clasped her beautiful hands till her sharp nails almost pierced them				131.16833955879383
all day dantès walked up and down his cell				2875.2114335012234
full pardon was accorded to those who had aided in his escape				2129.139378224956
no no continued the count had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge then you disapprove of duelling				57479.28369111184
i only speak that exact truth and you say that one of your friends lives in that house i say so and i repeat it for the third time that house is one inhabited by my friend and that friend is aramis all this will be cleared up at a later period murmured the young woman no monsieur be silent if you could see my heart said d artagnan you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity				1977.6658516104217
i will answer for the success of a project which will reflect so much honor on m de villefort the procureur arose delighted with the proposition but his wife slightly changed color				5890.68487937514
on the evening of the ball teresa was attired in her best her most brilliant ornaments in her hair and gayest glass beads she was in the costume of the women of frascati				32841.59909182943
the names of all including carlini were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the name of diavolaccio				14482.704322014
their toilet finished they descended the carriage awaited them at the door filled with sweetmeats and bouquets				36250.90009028074
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in she passed first				1003.9843575197622
i tell you that the dose has been double the poison changed and that this time it has succeeded				20692.956122160445
do you fear he will not understand yes oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how i talk to you then turning to maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrow he knows everything i know said she				407.10761018349166
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux the waiter had no suspicions andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all				636.601186854868
he came into the room went to the cupboard took out the bag and pocket book and both began for the third time to count their gold and bank notes				3433.2710004070923
dantès instantly turned to meet him				66.25358333931267
canst thou speak any patois i can do something better than that sir i can speak flemish where the devil didst thou learn it in artois where i fought for years				1014.6378069041898
a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme				202.3507957390172
no one answered to his first knocking				92975.92814579209
and yet this nature so distinguished this creature so beautiful this essence so fine was seen to turn insensibly toward material life as old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility				72913.01527354121
she howled as the hurricane howled and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature which also seemed to groan with despair				2057.6182612476996
never cried d artagnan				4.857497422742404
another glance between the young men convinced them both that neither had any wish to go back and as the tutor had already turned his horse s head they both spurred forward raoul crying follow me olivain and the count de guiche follow urban and planchet and before the tutor could recover from his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest				3390.082909949271
well baron i promise you some good exercise said the gascon				1078.7339845632205
la mazzolata gentlemen said the count of monte cristo as he entered i pray you excuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments besides you sent me word that you would come to me and i have held myself at your disposal franz and i have to thank you a thousand times count returned albert you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us indeed returned the count motioning the two young men to sit down				1317.0414033670982
he was perhaps about to regain his liberty at the worst he would have a companion and captivity that is shared is but half captivity				2211.536315776396
your excellency is safe and sound asked the host				1058.5076788380923
spur spur and he fired two pistols				3419.660912111632
well i must mortify myself				596.9892514067495
how do you mean the receipt of m de monte cristo is as good as money take it to rothschild s or lafitte s and they will take it off your hands at once what though payable at rome certainly it will only cost you a discount of or francs the receiver started back				1270.6556708004284
they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers brave young man murmured the king				593.7120875319512
ah madame danglars had risen and stood before the procureur whose hands she wrung in her feeble grasp				3929.07866178329
adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my door noirtier left the room when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation				1409.3845162664884
the plan adopted by d artagnan was soon perfected				69208.72393941393
it is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost to die whilst doing a good deed				10076.942582208467
her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first time that any man except monte cristo had been accorded an entrance into her presence				1833.122915015683
he was now a lieutenant				1396.4129170680387
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states				1832.1057436210663
i leave you therefore as i took you rich but little respected				11580.275305711542
when you return to this mundane sphere from your visionary world you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winter to quit paradise for earth heaven for hell				12634.484971706823

at length an old worm eaten shutter was opened or rather pushed ajar but closed again as soon as the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone upon the baldric sword belt and pistol pommels of d artagnan				220.91026460262023
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy				1911.4571714476906
mazarin turned pale and shrank back in the coach				2480.5155832411947
but wait				4584.381068801886
the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of misfortune				3197.0917064336268
how without incommding himself athos procures his equipment d artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris and did not stop till he came to athos s door				314.56167818451473

as the marquis had promised villefort found the marquise and renée in waiting				2937.9628895632472
he was a man of twenty five or six and held a piece of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining				29500.089909056405
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind				486.1896517753455

i think i can see him now mounted upon his superb animal and seated in his handsome saddle				2778.296047588627
this circumstance pleased m de tréville much as he thus became certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between m de la trémouille s testimony and himself				357.35675217669586

i say your troops for i presume that you gentlemen are frondeurs yes almost said aramis				47.80414724338027
to doubt any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony				52582.52514811483
can you see the air you breathe and yet without which you could not for a moment exist then we do not see those beings to whom you allude yes we do you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form				2855.2342840528086
i wish he said with his cunning smile to prevent them from being ungrateful to me it is but christian charity replied d artagnan not to lead one s neighbors into temptation it is exactly for that reason said mazarin that i wish to start before them d artagnan smiled he was just the man to understand the astute italian				7637.200296743615
there was no one like him for that and now replied d artagnan behold the sad spectacle that awaits us				506.6519157619162

at this exclamation his adversary bounded back and bending his bare head tried to distinguish in the gloom the features of the lieutenant				1469.3191048849699
he drew back terrified				38275.29211875524

it was scarcely eleven o clock in the morning and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m de tréville who could not fail to think the manner in which d artagnan had left him a little cavalier				6010.2490507566645
just so why he is a second ariosto no his name is the count of monte cristo there is no count of monte cristo said debray				780.3275325866134

while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years				992.9440748854028

during the five years of this seclusion which would have improved and matured the intellect of any other man m de beaufort had he not affected to brave the cardinal despise princes and walk alone without adherents or disciples would either have regained his liberty or made partisans				13491.990009271276
the same day he told his wife emmanuel and his daughter all that had occurred and a ray of hope if not of tranquillity returned to the family				4013.2842040284854

absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god				603.6019762028137
this however did not prevent his asking with the greatest coolness after his majesty s health				5824.299901585138
during the examination of milady by the officer as may well be imagined milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances				5777.982898523175
i was waiting for you sir said mordaunt raising his head and casting at his opponent a look it would be impossible to describe				9654.307370154327

my sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses my brother is reading his two papers la presse and les débats within six steps of her for wherever you see madame herbault you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find m emmanuel and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school at the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to five and twenty dressed in a silk morning gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose tree raised her head				492.3797268036688
this is what had happened				2768.644498427701
there was a great press of people in m de villefort s antechamber but madame danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name				904.4562606972712
he gallantly offered the right hand seat to beppo and sat by him				87.76583636902842

he turned around and mordaunt stood before him				73.12393509519748
i was there				811.1213423478467
an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy and his choice fell on you and your companion				1247.6027713612805
each examined the other with great attention while exchanging the customary compliments both were very handsome but of quite different styles of beauty				4034.6439638373927
anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the prince de condé who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of saint germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from rueil in whatsoever direction it might be				958.1849129385371
and yet that woman deserved her fate do you not think so on one s death bed the crimes of others appear very small in comparison with one s own said the executioner and falling back exhausted he closed his eyes				359.0562704288542
if she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies				1435.6533550307436
who occupies number the little fellow who arrived last night in a post chaise with his sister and who asked for an apartment with two beds the bell here rang for the third time with another shriek of anguish				1679.6962232303588

god is wearied he has punished you caderousse was fast sinking				50888.77131626786
on reaching the jetty athos and aramis stopped to look at a little boat made fast to a pile and ready rigged as if waiting to start				6335.514324085507
what is the matter then with this dear child				682.9069440794451
on the contrary gentlemen we would assist you if it were necessary what does he say grumbled porthos				90.64107375988476
but the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside				4453.694510595443
is it not worth francs to save our father s name from the chances of evil fortune and failure i thought so replied emmanuel but i wished to have your advice this is my counsel our accounts are made up and our bills paid all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office this was done instantly				3414.362240665909
i know a clever person at tours aramis stopped on seeing athos smile				567.1705744255624
madame danglars whispered a few words in the ear of debray who approached monte cristo saying the baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses i scarcely know replied the count it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost me well somewhere about francs debray conveyed the count s reply to the baroness				1854.4853396383367
but not until two o clock said d artagnan with the same calmness				5378.35304964836
i am at quite a loss how to answer you i admit said mme				39.53638148357844
but there must be some cause for this strange scene the count of morcerf s adventure exasperates the young man have you anything to do with it it was through haydée that the chamber was informed of his father s treason indeed said morrel				490.1664678824574
bonacieux who had sent for m laporte in order to be reconducted to the louvre should be running about the streets of paris at half past eleven at night at the risk of being abducted a second time				350.43749435942624
scarcely had d artagnan uttered these words when a ringing and sudden noise was heard resounding through the felucca which had now become dim in the obscurity of the night				1177.420327874464
that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercy s for pity s sake				5902.606652107989
tis well and may this money profit you				193.2208817700659
the queen can not you make allowances for the pettishness of a queen and a princess				3409.9562052941665
in an instant a space three feet long by two feet broad was cleared and dantès could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the arms of the spada family viz a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal s hat				2135.1510389277323
look he said				316.50061111147704
i can not comprehend what induced you to buy three therefore i only purchased two said aramis				45.49605061928845
this parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs				1706.1239969485937
your majesty is bored				71648.00627608906
come and converse with us for just five minutes sword in hand upon this deserted terrace one moment gentlemen cried flamarens				90269.23871559811
do you agree with aramis not at all said d artagnan i am precisely of the contrary opinion what				550.1511517472129
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord				16118.38025246047
monte cristo looked at her with an indescribable expression of interest and pity				2603.6915278671586
it must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor in which d artagnan lodged those who called on him were exempted from this detention				41967.52621992977

he opened it and read as follows dear m d artagnan it is wrong thus to neglect your friends particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time				327.3150355529922
whatever may ensue i will go if you are determined said athos do so but the bastille said aramis				68.27125455798026
young edward a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the least disconcert the speaker who continued yes gentlemen edward the infant phenomenon who is quite an adept in the art of killing you are jesting not at all				604.4487599797394
or the mysterious benefactress said athos				12.704190092577345
i give you francs that is livres of income a fortune such as i wish i had myself and you are not satisfied and the five and forty thousand francs inquired caderousse in a hoarse voice where are they				3284.6562666802474
this athos was connected with three young musketeers named porthos d artagnan and he stopped short				3038.317481686994
of aramis yes since he has become an abbé				1121.2662834478667

i might not always be content with that answer replied the visitor for i come from one to whom everyone must be at home				1333.0867789109147
his glance was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that villefort turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what person this dark look was directed				10807.074422551557
unhappily those times are past nonsense				3910.0784379033694
for stealing for stealing				52691.70720705816
i think so am i not right m de villefort asked monte cristo				176.0168818918721
the return to la rochelle therefore was profoundly dull				43209.58543040789
bonacieux since he has told you what he has suffered but to suffer for him is happiness milady replied mechanically yes that is happiness she was thinking of something else				4726.640261258444
be satisfied all who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve even the queen herself what do you say sire				4083.28549327595
i told you this i am now grieved i have kept my word				568.2580051911442
therefore tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his position provided he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of francs he stretched himself on his bed and after turning over two or three times fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying				25743.640812897214
on reaching la storta the point from whence rome is first visible the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of saint peter s which may be seen long before any other object is distinguishable				32905.5544708212
but he said the count s generosity is too overwhelming valentine will be satisfied with my humble fortune				868.7890401465384
and that mysterious staircase the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the doctor and nurse pass or even the father carrying the sleeping child here madame danglars instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted				1420.743281758461
whenever your majesty pleases				94342.68580752626
i believe he s swimming toward us				486.4266431411913
the cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice and the king was very pale				823.6212571914003
charles stuart said the colonel of the english regiment approaching the king who had just put on the insignia of royalty do you yield yourself a prisoner colonel tomlison said charles kings can not yield the man alone submits to force your sword the king drew his sword and broke it on his knee				6274.8547144530585
that is what i heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after i had entered it and that is why on account of the living mercédès and my deceased father i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand and i have revenged myself and you are sure the unhappy fernand did that i am satisfied madame that he did what i have told you besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards that a stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and murdered ali				3189.5422021130075
that s what i mean said andrea endeavoring to smile quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio				2858.780421473695
i am your landlord ah ah said d artagnan half rising and bowing you are my landlord yes monsieur yes				1078.7082658474299
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths				68444.96343485109
the drum immediately beat and the little troop advanced at charging pace				2195.6259380508054
seated with folded arms in a corner of the carriage he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them				128.57115748262981
it will be a work of time but those who have begun by crying out down with mazarin				833.3811053003568
men were giants in those times said athos now we are pigmies in comparison				33572.16306212173
we are observed they are coming to meet us				474.1064096335936
i have had no occasion to notice him particularly he s an old acquaintance				6189.619955611502
a man the discussion is going to begin again said mme				25.62609929240916
then i forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the light				1425.6497934349263
and moreover i should not be surprised had we been forestalled by cromwell				2591.7283329407287
but do you wish to marry andrea my dear m danglars that you are asking so many questions ma foi said danglars it would not be a bad speculation i fancy and you know i am a speculator you are not thinking of mademoiselle danglars i hope you would not like poor andrea to have his throat cut by albert albert repeated danglars shrugging his shoulders ah well he would care very little about it i think but he is betrothed to your daughter i believe well m de morcerf and i have talked about this marriage but madame de morcerf and albert you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match indeed i imagine that mademoiselle danglars is as good as m de morcerf mademoiselle danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes oh i do not mean her fortune only but tell me what why did you not invite m and madame de morcerf to your dinner i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air yes yes said danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good why so because it is the air she always breathed in her youth monte cristo took no notice of this ill natured remark				6461.993139507309
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief				3425.1539908243776
upon my word cried the old man you make short work of this kind of affair				1753.8835908038643
farewell my son said the curate till tomorrow till tomorrow rash youth said the jesuit				26773.465636018413
explain yourself then noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on valentine s hand				303.5790310361528
gad replied d artagnan he has already given me good information and he may do the same again whilst all this was going on athos and aramis were entering paris by the faubourg st antoine				45223.95874291663
one might have supposed the bastille appeared before you and that the gigantic medusa had converted you into stone				2131.874193574589
when the operation was concluded and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a looking glass				969.2116058708439
george villiers placed himself before the glass as we have said restored the undulations to his beautiful hair which the weight of his hat had disordered twisted his mustache and his heart swelling with joy happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed for he smiled upon himself with pride and hope				1556.0071676043008
conceal your wounds when you have any silence is the last joy of the unhappy				8477.434559058218
but if we do risk being killed said porthos at least i should like to know what for you would be all the wiser said athos				99.27234294083951
he received also the office of admiral which had been held by his father the duc de vendome and an indemnity for his houses and castles demolished by the parliament of bretagne				68896.38063089515
at sight of the officer broussel was somewhat moved but seeing him bow politely he rose and bowed also				1661.5011816867705
they locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the night and left him to himself during the day				466.01262348312207
but what must i do asked milady				144.48104839093443
what could be his intentions towards him				75.50178394091134
porthos did the same				1768.058429399853
this affair made a great noise				2322.4781270474737
they talk of making him an ambassador and what are his claims to the peerage he has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the siècle and voted five or six years on the ministerial side bravo viscount said monte cristo smiling you are a delightful cicerone				13924.095588034932
at length a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely master her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single tear				7244.0079494144475
am i or am i not the queen				495.96260475467693
no doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected and had consequently sent intruders out of the way				724.9802748105275
never had he been so well received				4324.349081872132
ay that will do at armentières where is that armentières a little town on the lys i shall only have to cross the river and i shall be in a foreign country capital				2709.3001903784443
the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of her amorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her				244.62006904433005
it is for that reason i am delighted to see you continued the abbé although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newton s system				12562.252548401808
dantès was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom				1842.5111190603975
i take charge of everything be easy it appears however said lord de winter if there are any measures to take against the countess it concerns me she is my sister in law and me said athos she is my wife d artagnan smiled for he understood that athos was sure of his vengeance when he revealed such a secret				1464.3014015925517
here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this affair				1763.0441926919345
it is you who set out seven or eight months ago from your country to seek your fortune in the capital yes monseigneur you came through meung where something befell you				151.48344442381122
or at least i will go later he drew kitty to him				84.09589221322635
i fear i shall be forced to suspend payment have you no friends who could assist you morrel smiled mournfully				74713.31580766542
he was convinced that lucien s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée d antin				8919.761729203918
depraved as a girl adulterous as a wife an unnatural sister homicide poisoner execrated by all who knew her by every nation that had been visited by her she died accursed by heaven and earth a sob which mordaunt could not repress burst from his throat and his livid face became suffused with blood he clenched his fists sweat covered his face his hair like hamlet s stood on end and racked with fury he cried out silence sir				341.45151758252615
i can t leave you alone in this abominable country thanks my worthy friend				773.3177916108418
ah replied he guessing franz s thought i know this is a serious matter what should you do in my place i who have nothing to lose i should go you would accept yes were it only out of curiosity there is something very peculiar about this chief then listen said gaetano lowering his voice i do not know if what they say is true he stopped to see if anyone was near				4135.115369576138
cheer up said she to noirtier				866.6755193842066
did you send this wine aramis said athos				14.80203415313732
however it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies apprised in time of the visit paid him monte cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants				3342.0600908994065
he left his address as he had done before and set off again at the same pace for pontoise				47568.999716079925
which is my best cavalry horse vulcan and the best hack bayard what horse dost thou choose for thyself i like rustaud my lord a good animal whose paces suit me strong thinkest thou half norman half mecklenburger will go night and day that will do for us				526.0188193641088
what were you saying he asked with his flattering manner that monsieur de beaufort had escaped were you not oh no my lord said the incredulous soldier				2787.5345952352477
happily d artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties				61459.021086036075
what company company of tréville advance and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour the three companions advanced rather humbly for all were now convinced that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves leaving athos the post of speaker				13787.333463930883
in vain did franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep				1504.3466281833162
aha continued d artagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being reinforced				59167.106482850984
at length the hour drew near				3568.477978553046
from the rue de bons enfants to that of the ferronnerie from the rue saint thomas du louvre to the pont neuf from the rue richelieu to the porte saint honore there were more than ten thousand armed men those who were at the front hurled defiance at the impassive sentinels of the regiment of guards posted around the palais royal the gates of which were closed behind them a precaution which made their situation precarious				41082.940284684235
well asked the duke when they were alone				994.1526384732438
what had she done to excite the malice of an enemy				1335.0702574825636
listen then lord winter				949.3080916161682
a thousand francs but whence have you obtained them listen to me mother and do not yield too much to agitation and albert rising kissed his mother on both cheeks then stood looking at her				225.81301696916933
winter give the necessary orders winter then left the tent in the meantime the king finished his toilet				5424.145455959324
this affair does not then weigh upon your conscience faith no and you d artagnan i i own that when my mind returns to that terrible period i have no recollection of anything but the rigid corpse of poor madame bonancieux				77514.97284284602
porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them aramis had eight of them				142.70875754817837
i will call salvieux and make him write the letter be as quick as possible i must be on the road in a quarter of an hour tell your coachman to stop at the door you will present my excuses to the marquise and mademoiselle renée whom i leave on such a day with great regret you will find them both here and can make your farewells in person a thousand thanks and now for the letter the marquis rang a servant entered				536.7118862110162
the sentence is passed and in a few hours will be executed it must be so and i will not endeavor to prevent it				93.08695441120278
i therefore may hesitate between you				136.97982608427162
d artagnan cried she is it you				147.45965193155988
there were nobles who made war against each other there was the king who made war against the cardinal there was spain which made war against the king				636.4014789302124
to be sure answered danglars				150.5151637826144
finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had taken place and dantès began to fancy the inspector s visit but a dream an illusion of the brain				2818.372558112004
he was placed before a large glass which reflected the whole apartment and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the room and everything which was going on around him				79.59518506098269
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to you yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one				884.9680547282233
well said the banker to his daughter are we then all to be excluded he then led the young man into the study and either by chance or manœuvre the door was partially closed after andrea so that from the place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything but as the banker had accompanied andrea madame danglars appeared to take no notice of it				97.0835101034122
but as a man of honor should answer another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality morrel shuddered and looked at the man who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown				51408.80278896865
tis not a long time since the late cardinal burnt urban grandier though my friend urban grandier wasn t a sorcerer he was a learned man				220.103376283657
i will go immediately and inform him of your arrival and philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards monte cristo appeared on the threshold				2155.5419642778115
he did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the prisoners look upon with utter despair				2056.686380930195
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four but you are not one of us said porthos				108.5165829855004
if he tells the baron said she i am lost for the baron who knows very well that i shall not kill myself will place me before him with a knife in my hand and he will discover that all this despair is but acted she placed herself before the glass and regarded herself attentively never had she appeared more beautiful				6295.912350424495
during the evening two men engaged for the purpose had carried noirtier from valentine s room into his own and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child				962.0067003963768
where are you going cried the young girl extending her hand through the opening and seizing maximilian by his coat for she understood from her own agitated feelings that her lover s calmness could not be real where are you going i am going that i may not bring fresh trouble into your family and to set an example which every honest and devoted man situated as i am may follow before you leave me tell me what you are going to do maximilian the young man smiled sorrowfully				4393.386099326669
the emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even louis himself and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is incalculable had morrel even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them				130.84974282341616
the steward entered				572.0833221669491
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal s motive				5935.5047614064815
mademoiselle danglars charms were heightened in the opinion of the young men and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor				46071.7431123333
because that young man so handsome so elegant so polished is a child i have adopted and who does not even know who was his father very well you are always the same athos great and generous				9211.413791998328
monsieur le comte monsieur le chevalier if ever i am king sire you have already done us more honor than simple gentlemen could ever aspire to therefore gratitude is on our side				1486.4029336752965
he had no fears as to how he should live good seamen are welcome everywhere				12596.2746601372
courted by my step mother who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my father who says he has never before heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed idolized by edward who notwithstanding his fear of the count s large black eyes runs to meet him the moment he arrives and opens his hand in which he is sure to find some delightful present m				589.2603480345043
i fancy i perceive around us faces of different officers in the royal army is not that the duc de chatillon himself coming toward us with his brigadiers good day sirs said the duke advancing you are puzzled by what you see here but one word will explain everything				1010.8541729084351
as the gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the ring				2392.6711870470704
d artagnan signed to them to draw near				3383.903752267533
if you had been a man you would not have let him go from here woman or else he should not have reached beaucaire woman the road takes a turn he is obliged to follow it while alongside of the canal there is a shorter road woman you offend the good god				550.5752444615839
alight planchet and inquire for i confess that i have scarcely courage so to do planchet alighted				8224.30200243311
but d artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses				13296.14896887424
you are not an enemy of our holy faith said she hesitatingly				11648.227680790587
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no doubt in former days had been a volcano an extinct volcano before the days when remus and romulus had deserted alba to come and found the city of rome				2168.743750927211
we are saved said valentine				157.47640336490986
at the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire and he was obliged to obey				9557.678077817882
oh yes oh yes i do indeed repent and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist				48501.61702018636
ah sir said he tell me what is the matter with me				138.25008757197193
the guards of monsieur the cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them and for the honor of the corps even the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves listen to monsieur de tréville said the king listen to him				74.84709734403326
well how is it with this madman exclaimed he turning round as the noise of the door announced the entrance of the host who came in to inquire if he was unhurt				81631.9186246046
their connection could not last long without ruining both				2937.352147626805
yes answered monte cristo happily yes conscience does remain and if it did not how wretched we should be				915.9288249797196
be it understood we are speaking of athos				290.02155668111163
a woman who had been a reigning beauty a year before he was born could not be the subject of any scheme for him				84.08426400382015
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage				2078.568707533643
reflect upon it d artagnan did reflect and resolved to thrash planchet provisionally which he did with the conscientiousness that d artagnan carried into everything				1033.74433294048
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat				6896.504118619664
the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour				1590.6972771778883
all was over carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall				3993.853926221829
come sir said he addressing broussel silence that woman and follow me silence me				101.97636568072555
everything appeared as usual the precious secretaire in its place and the key in the secretaire				41513.01865768096
yes my lord ah that is true said de guiche i had forgotten it that is easily understood it was you who took him count said raoul smiling				729.3815194271629
and now my dear child adieu for the present				3218.785322649645
porthos was delighted and yet during the entire repast he seemed to be preoccupied				9272.210329103076
it is useless for i swear to you that you are as safe here as you were twenty years ago you athos in the rue ferou and you aramis in the rue de vaugirard stop cried athos extending his hand to one of the grated windows by which the room was lighted you will soon know what to expect for here he is who mordaunt in fact looking at the place to which athos pointed d artagnan saw a cavalier coming toward the house at full gallop				1380.275182728092
stories of gypsies who steal children are not at all in vogue in this part of the world and would not be believed				29579.420258331076
d artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere				59993.08570131888
bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu and she was to take away mme				177.54447719254756

it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette				6521.189771276107

one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of french which he however wrote with great facility the day after this important information had been given to the king s attorney a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue férou and rapping at an olive green door asked if the abbé busoni were within				2777.567505991033

perhaps you had a spy at your heels and your visit if it should ever be known to the cardinal will thus seem legitimate d artagnan drew up his request and m de tréville on receiving it assured him that by two o clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers				41554.68813143024

your wisdom and your affection must serve me as guides				10666.662493636399

well well said the jeweller you seem my good friends to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone oh no answered caderousse that was not my reason i can assure you but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune and it is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream the jeweller smiled				632.4735279606791

that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian nonsense				3669.915400544445

the count alone seemed unmoved nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks				2462.9777813407036
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother s bed				929.5535332566246

no no said he				6.233065813495435
at this moment the duke s surgeon arrived quite terrified he was already on board the admiral s ship where they had been obliged to seek him				75.31390733985573
no but franz has for heaven s sake not a word of this before him				85.1435215726996
come in here said d avrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay				6106.31163149981
on the other hand he was about to land without any other escort than these men on an island which had indeed a very religious name but which did not seem to franz likely to afford him much hospitality thanks to the smugglers and bandits				9544.616227382432

the guards under the command of m dessessart took up their quarters at the minimes but as we know d artagnan possessed with ambition to enter the musketeers had formed but few friendships among his comrades and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own reflections				50561.3209028121

correcting himself immediately he said excuse me sir hope alone makes me almost mad what will not reality do but said danglars who on his part did not perceive how soon the conversation which was at first disinterested was turning to a business transaction there is doubtless a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you which asked the young man				173.6057491046451

he then with noiseless haste took out the horse that he had ridden on the previous evening saddled and bridled it himself and led the animal into the alley to the right of the kitchen garden opened a side door which conducted him to a bridle road shut it after him and d artagnan saw him pass by like a dart bending as he went beneath the pendent flowery branches of maple and acacia				34703.95433545436
the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient and locked the door was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the house of the king s attorney				3127.114169344799
i have tried to make you a happy man and you have turned out a murderer oh monsieur said caderousse make one more attempt try me once more i will said the count				177.2004149193761
milady clarik received d artagnan ceremoniously				137143.36007616308
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to d artagnan s deliberations this was the name of madame de longueville				3696.9074418495734
do you think of dying my lord said she				39.55498376667014
i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs an officer brave and handsome as a youthful caesar then pretending to see raoul for the first time ah				334.1471990582487
yes count you know what i told you all remains the same then in that quarter it is more than ever a settled thing said lucien and considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make he adjusted the glass to his eye and biting the top of his gold headed cane began to make the tour of the apartment examining the arms and the pictures				4626.3509144127265
i have a son too and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months voyage then i have your leave sir yes if you have nothing more to say to me nothing captain leclere did not before he died give you a letter for me he was unable to write sir				380.06632013373815
i understand my game kitty i have this one safe what will you do with him madame what will i do with him				73.48448664833136
she cast her eyes again over the note to peruse it a second time and saw there was a postscript				42719.254132570575
he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him				67.02615345987675
he is a priest learned in cases of conscience and we will tell him ours it was then agreed that they were to go first to monsieur de bouillon as his house came first but first of all athos begged that he might go to the hotel du grand charlemagne to see raoul				1074.0289497358542
the air and water were shining in the beams of the morning sun on the shore the sailors were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the boat was at anchor undulating gracefully on the water				1889.647502615335
i don t think so answered the other he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme				47482.204383524804
in truth madame do you think that can be possible indeed sir said milady you must be either drunk or mad				1478.6430679975642
or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called anything villefort s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary				2083.6932549946932
we four have got to master these eight fools and their stupid captain				757.7459760766753
sell cried mousqueton about whom there was a remnant of his ancient marauding character left				1511.0225086285864
your honors said he that woman had a child that child has become a man the tigress had a little one the tiger has roused himself he is ready to spring upon you beware athos glanced around at his friends with a melancholy smile				578.5015395363368
we have before stated that all the servants had fled				17764.88200742955
my young vicomte replied scarron i suppose you wish to propose to her an alliance offensive and defensive raoul blushed again				387.6659607721297
yes monsieur said d artagnan lowering his voice and you will pardon me i hope for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business speak then i am all attention it concerns nothing less said d artagnan than the honor perhaps the life of the queen what did you say asked m de tréville glancing round to see if they were surely alone and then fixing his questioning look upon d artagnan				71.42024627190825
it is war said the prince				810.5189741130112
porthos had received a thrust through his arm and bicarat one through his thigh				33806.37956015566
come now you don t really wish it but he is dead i am sure of it he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged all right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave peste				34625.637773828756
i am now quite at your service gentlemen said he				7.817788621438672
no said villefort fetch the nearest the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbé who lives next door to you				169.85593520804966
monsieur said mademoiselle d aubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voiture s friends				530.8960150603588
but this last and dreaded resource served only to exasperate the multitude				48911.351138034304
friend mousqueton you see that we have a reinforcement and we must have an increase of supplies mousqueton said d artagnan you must render me a service what monsieur you must give your recipe to planchet				780.1087748278175
you may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me				91.98666662996781
she wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night and poor kitty pale and trembling awaited d artagnan s reply				616.0813055771591
but d artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him thus who had the insolence to ridicule him				80.70564976508074
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother				1637.895381525504
pray tell me is it sympathy of heart no of taste continued franz gravely				5363.739339873991
i should never have taken him for anything more than a mere major and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no manner				943.818257964279
i obey my captain s orders				2965.4197352835636
raoul resolved not to quit the room without having spoken to the beautiful girl with the soft eyes who by a strange fancy although she bore no resemblance reminded him of his poor little louise whom he had left in the chateau de la valliere and whom in the midst of all the party he had never for one moment quite forgotten				2922.544229674346
if that be the case said d artagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another				735.8614059202215
at these words he gave me a ring				2858.7899636987445
i was called to see him on his dying bed that i might administer to him the consolations of religion and of what did he die asked caderousse in a choking voice				624.4465931790044
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said smiling graciously i thank you for having insisted on seeing me i ought to ask your majesty s pardon but i wished to receive your commands from your own mouth do you accept the commission which i have intrusted to you with gratitude very well be here at midnight i will not fail monsieur d artagnan continued the queen i know your disinterestedness too well to speak of my own gratitude at such a moment but i swear to you that i shall not forget this second service as i forgot the first your majesty is free to forget or to remember as it pleases you and i know not what you mean said d artagnan bowing				2612.9860831822007
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity				2026.0153775263962
with the first light dantès resumed his search				2630.345013196726
no but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet				46516.3244659106
he was a man about twenty two or twenty three years old but who appeared much older from ascetic exercises				50453.18497414926
anybody may see by our bearing that we are people of condition pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole on their steeds aramis				354.49395705530713
one last favor my lord said he to the baron				3057.329693908239
you have come then at last				1161.0757248297434
from time to time a shot from a musket or the blade of a rapier flashed among the crowd projectiles continued to hail down from the windows and some shots were heard the echo of which though they were probably fired in the air made all hearts vibrate				64773.47280437776
then he added in a low tone yes that is the haven and then he again plunged into a train of thought the character of which was better revealed by a sad smile than it would have been by tears				2881.8575219819827
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous				8915.27990492826
athos invited d artagnan to follow them and although ignorant of the game which he had never played he accepted not knowing what to do with his time from nine o clock in the morning as it then scarcely was till twelve				8164.215396575018
he had received a message from the prince to whom he had hastened with olivain the instant he had received it				92.34871786535437
dantès followed him his features were no longer contracted and now wore their usual expression but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve				6847.548373916499
you are not willing that i should kill my body and you make yourself the agent of him who would kill my soul but i repeat it again to you replied felton in great emotion no danger threatens you i will answer for lord de winter as for myself dunce cried milady dunce				82147.27245440388
she is ill				14596.251819552634
listen attentively alas stammered villefort i do not lose a single word m				686.4289498874773
expiation notwithstanding the density of the crowd m de villefort saw it open before him				79.2333978237186
happen what will the devil take them they can t eat us and he mounted his horse				930.1809375116102
you possess a quality which can never belong to mademoiselle danglars				422.5726760739289
la carconte on the contrary rose and going with a firm step towards the door opened it saying as she did so come in dear m joannes ma foi said the jeweller drenched with rain i am not destined to return to beaucaire tonight				8061.500037560091
grimaud sprang up				861.7913396279752
the enemy cried the king				499.9032584278519
no more edicts no more of the cardinal s guards no more de jussacs nor other bloodhounds				91612.63153442109
but hush here comes somebody tis caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured edmond				1158.7930825895878
as i told you it is an old family jewel and you sold it asked d artagnan hesitatingly				15967.114660867706
when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door				351.88087467177996
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say but by way of rewarding your honesty i give you another double napoleon that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you so extreme was the surprise of the sailor that he was unable even to thank edmond whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment				632.2304956410201
moreover you are our prisoners fool cried aramis knowest thou not then mordaunt				1862.5054341043995
then m de tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except d artagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place				874.2037939572514
general said the president we acknowledge no king louis xviii or an ex emperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from france which is his kingdom by violence and treason excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge louis xviii but i do as he has made me a baron and a field marshal and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba and have deceived us				521.1329998353567
i have answered for you				77.5632528337065
during the whole of this nocturnal ride during the whole time that he was endeavoring to understand the various characters of comminges guitant and villequier mazarin was in truth studying more especially one man				221.85759524704255
who goes asked the captain				701.8016793174395
have you a letter of audience asked a porter advancing to the new arrival				15350.270255315341
speak to the governor then and where is the governor in the country anger mounted to d artagnan s face he frowned and his cheeks were colored				6210.675849950339
the fifth of september chapter				249.34618206039158
and now whenever he wishes well whenever he wishes planchet began to sing un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin je crois qu il gronde contre le mazarin				832.599017349525
return whence you came take back those horrible vegetables and that poor kickshaw				57021.58882591958
m de villefort entered followed by barrois				2742.051022570553
but all the time he was in paris you of course did not lose sight of him no sire where did he lodge rue de la harpe				19287.716849667424
oh yes said she smiling but we won t tell him in the evening lord de winter accompanied the supper				1589.3848492164766
no i should only regret if the horse had not proved good it is so good that i have distanced m de château renaud one of the best riders in france and m debray who both mount the minister s arabians and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars who always go at six leagues an hour then they follow you asked monte cristo				392.74957216565764
my child cried villefort he carries away the body of my child				948.9881111372531
come caderousse no nonsense said he				9.437986207392719
before this day closes if m danglars is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die				1647.4852445320596
when he reached the door a stream of people who had been disappointed in not being able to get into the house and to make amends had collected to see him come out stood on each side as he passed many among them glaring on him with threatening looks				4062.8149413437986
athos was then sent to the cardinal but unfortunately the cardinal was at the louvre with the king				638.5520831535839
well he shall live mercédès uttered a cry which made the tears start from monte cristo s eyes but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect them far more precious were they in his eyes than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir				27083.509005277956
but however and whensoever he did escape what hatred he must cherish against him to whom he owed his long imprisonment who had taken him rich brave glorious beloved by women feared by men to cut off his life s best happiest years for it is not life it is merely existence in prison				1473.2836811966936
neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her				255.29053957644734
i desire to know what is the meaning of this be kind enough madame to listen to me said danglars				198.42846125296754
the rendezvous chapter xxiv				20537.777744152485
athos made no reply				608.9432295594296
charles shuddered				3563.502618673975
if you had been ten years engaged in war as grimaud and i have been my dear blaisois you would know the difference there is between the goods of others and the goods of enemies				1426.4909575486088
indeed said julie might we not almost fancy emmanuel that those people so rich so happy but yesterday had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault s stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect what a dire misfortune said emmanuel thinking of morcerf and danglars				388.8725250172001
it remains here said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly				18423.80274534498
give me your hand and let us go to the minister and yet she added suppose he should refuse and that the king loses the battle his majesty will then take refuge in holland where i hear his highness the prince of wales now is and can his majesty count upon many such subjects as yourself for his flight alas				1239.6239693951609
at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance				40086.57801738517
aramis came behind giving his arm to porthos				258.91219551960984
ho exclaimed the latter the cardinal				285.85349695088945
yes said he yes anne of austria is my true queen				485.605319637634
he embraced juxon and pressed the hand of aramis				416.0062177885236
both raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed				3017.3279157828906
it is upon one higher placed than i am that god has laid this responsibility to you no to you alone				902.8386899553519
edmond still heard the sound				2956.5571870775993
much obliged to you monsieur dulaurier				62822.04782447003
dream of vengeance that evening milady gave orders that when m d artagnan came as usual he should be immediately admitted but he did not come				1252.6583624143898
that is not an answer replied athos				12.80051857070379
she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the room with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her				248.20157503166084
there was one lying on the table he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them				139.5928874969631
that a nobleman whom he did not know had wished to take charge of it had answered for its future and had taken it away that was true ah				259.58146582607475
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were				2692.8964758927305
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saint méran s				1095.4311121969301
we shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left her plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection a dark hell at the gate of which she has almost left hope behind because for the first time she doubts for the first time she fears				39687.47372369441
you will return after three or four years with a russian princess for a bride and no one will think more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years ago thank you my dear beauchamp thank you for the excellent feeling which prompts your advice but it can not be				950.0271964529511
planchet was more courageous it must be admitted by day than by night				1189.5079502695453
england needs tranquillity at home in order to consummate the expulsion of her king france needs tranquillity to establish on solid foundations the throne of her young monarch				7675.226608324948
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down sir i beg of you monte cristo pointed to a chair which the procureur was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the count merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when m villefort entered				548.022778434014
in that case felton would escape her for in order to secure success the magic of a continuous seduction was necessary				4381.67014222071
i will see about the continuation of it and tomorrow i hope you will be satisfied with the corrections i shall have made in consequence of your advice work slowly said the curate we leave you in an excellent tone of mind yes the ground is all sown said the jesuit and we have not to fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone another upon the highway or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest aves cœli comederunt illam plague stifle you and your latin said d artagnan who began to feel all his patience exhausted				4204.193413842354
be off you wretch cried aramis throwing his skullcap in his face				938.9397921460217
the scotch my brothers				3077.728598624525
the queen was in a morning gown but it became her still for like diana of poictiers and ninon anne of austria enjoyed the privilege of remaining ever beautiful nevertheless this morning she looked handsomer than usual for her eyes had all the sparkle inward satisfaction adds to expression				3335.841210498072
as soon as she perceived him she cried you have promised your protection you have promised to save me from her anger				1685.5203319703935
pass on replied the guard				1784.1241327295024
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg e				1491.7054797303595
you see said porthos this is my usual style devil take me answered d artagnan i wish you joy of it				90.28726717819767
but sit down said monte cristo really i do not know what i have been thinking of i have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour don t mention it the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to seat himself				339.18177685797014
this drunken caderousse has made me lose the thread of my sentence drunk if you like so much the worse for those who fear wine for it is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will extract from their hearts and caderousse began to sing the two last lines of a song very popular at the time tous les méchants sont buveurs d eau c est bien prouvé par le déluge you said sir you would like to help me but yes but i added to help you it would be sufficient that dantès did not marry her you love and the marriage may easily be thwarted methinks and yet dantès need not die death alone can separate them remarked fernand				1392.0722672097816
then you will start after the queen no said mazarin again				237.79361222884867
i waited for him until this hour replied franz				113.69734597502476
the three valets passed without accident				8366.061915776201
she then tried to seize the sword with her hands but d artagnan kept it free from her grasp and presenting the point sometimes at her eyes sometimes at her breast compelled her to glide behind the bedstead while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kitty s apartment				733.8402758456106
i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercédès to know if i should find her still free				4716.679792864479
is that what you wish for asked she				73.54758596456013
moreover from being so long in twilight or darkness his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night common to the hyena and the wolf				24578.766876698755
d artagnan				18.92759479303968
from time to time a dull sound was heard like that of a rising tempest or a billow of the sea but nothing clear nothing distinct nothing intelligible it was like those mysterious subterraneous noises that precede an earthquake				62297.802708766154
as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it				84.0835022117426
he goes two or three times a week dost thou know noisy well i think so truly my nurse lives there is there a convent at noisy isn t there a great and grand one the convent of jesuits what is thy name friquet d artagnan wrote the child s name in his tablets				41199.311915021644
how long will this fuse burn asked this person				1203.9863948008947
therefore when at dessert upon a sign from d artagnan porthos had sent away his servants and the two friends were alone porthos said d artagnan who will attend you in your campaigns why replied porthos mouston of course this was a blow to d artagnan				202.27979275256862
stir but a step said they and you are a dead man why should you threaten me with death cried i when i have already declared my innocence tush tush cried the men keep your innocent stories to tell to the judge at nîmes				17620.51679576158
what monseigneur said d artagnan with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself				379.65334085125625
when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave				27951.920708810278
bravo cried mazarin they told me that you were the man i wanted				3043.171879951491
that mazarin was contemptible and that i wouldn t serve mazarin				721.0974641324692
but harrison paid not the least attention to him and entering the king s room followed by his companion charles stuart said he an order has come to conduct you to london without stopping day or night				1107.3035804244269

the stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several persons stopped at the door				351.0191559821203
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services				74780.964725122

wretched men their officers wish to see you sir i have no time to see them				118.57883599169938

it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there mercédès dwelt				17956.96699149743

the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of d artagnan and porthos in their hands				572.5333307412911
don t disturb yourself julie said he				11.498579993157119
the abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same				1727.2809423824951

with the aid of his pickaxe dantès after the manner of a labor saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper rock and the one that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre				56042.33611567109
there was a postscript i write by the same courier to our worthy friend aramis in his convent in his convent				3269.0435584044326

he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller				8453.400506145847
you wish to destroy yourself said the count you have written it well said morrel changing his expression of calmness for one of violence well and if i do intend to turn this pistol against myself who shall prevent me who will dare prevent me				111.74584533541197

thirty five or thirty six mother so young it is impossible said mercédès replying at the same time to what albert said as well as to her own private reflection				9189.697326585025

now let us lay down the plan of campaign said porthos				15.429682316447764
athos cried the two musketeers				1152.6467879679635
he recalled all at once the warnings of lord de winter the seductions of milady her first attempts after her arrival				16414.38795787078
his glance was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his lips were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing proof of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his forehead and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole				2106.4564624776103
he extended his hand				278.04893594262495
scarcely had dawn gilded his window curtains when he sprang out of bed and opened the windows				1259.4070111848496
an old gentleman continued the concierge a staunch follower of the bourbons he had an only daughter who married m de villefort who had been the king s attorney at nîmes and afterwards at versailles monte cristo glanced at bertuccio who became whiter than the wall against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling				6641.87357969611
d avrigny continued to look at noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead				1448.521091445292
yes replied she trying to recover her self possession				2900.033118453322
a bell resounded				67404.77537352983
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph				8459.408674513976
disguised as a coachman exclaimed mazarin				158.00660757767608
these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that dantès could easily read it as well as make out the sense it being in italian a language he as a provençal perfectly understood				2665.5430574737097
ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there				944.8656494548123
really porthos you are a gifted individual i have heard speak said porthos of a certain milo of crotona who performed wonderful feats such as binding his forehead with a cord and bursting it of killing an ox with a blow of his fist and carrying it home on his shoulders et cetera				41115.550768315414
i must go thither tonight instantly				3113.7079591877855
a dungeon				3554.5522417940656
do you know what they are saying here no your eminence well they say that monsieur de beaufort is going to escape from vincennes if he has not done so already the officer s face expressed complete stupefaction				3637.7183547544373
pity me				72.29583260039107
but aramis was livid				5785.525927273586
for an instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the head disappeared				1321.2929995301686
yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him				75.7984822953052
money and sanctity each in a moiety elisabeth de rossan marquise de ganges was one of the famous women of the court of louis xiv				2538.1166497079403
the citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime and you do you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body how miserable not to be free don t be downcast				43668.96427331707
an instant afterward the three young men separated agreeing to meet again at four o clock with athos and leaving planchet to guard the house				403.1768676948442
the woman followed him and lord de winter did not appear				7038.664818621625
i have not a penny about me you forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms which that which i found at your feet and replaced in your pocket hold your tongue imprudent man				206.05499925134728
with what my father said just now he returned a sign in the negative				29032.764087036125
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of impudence your majesty on your side said d artagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been you are in error sir answered the queen				376.1842249254658
it is ali cried albert in the midst of the general surprise				2004.9004460578426
he sent us home in his own carriage				1329.168586404056
chapter xlii				4256.340073218689
god who might have directed the assassin s dagger so as to end your career in a moment has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance				7936.593752792181
but he had scarcely left before danglars with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frédérick exclaimed fool then enclosing monte cristo s receipt in a little pocket book he added yes come at twelve o clock i shall then be far away then he double locked his door emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand francs in bank notes burned several papers left others exposed to view and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed to madame la baronne danglars i will place it on her table myself tonight he murmured				2681.9681354001386
these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been				5144.379399440463
tis well				486.3635578392447
because replied d artagnan the queen desired every one to leave and i thought that this command was intended for us as well as for the rest and you have been here since about a quarter of an hour said d artagnan motioning to porthos not to contradict him				63.014472956365395
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair				4967.247142980774
he took the arm of château renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins				14482.082805108921
i thought you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they thought about me and i am in despair how will that affect you since mademoiselle danglars was not among the number here who thought of you				163.79328180311103
a bed without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a prie dieu all its furniture				5326.227921440921
where are you murmured coquenard and he tried to smile				538.2732429466537
what are you thinking about said the king go on my good parry unless you are tired parry resumed his reading				6933.64554453839
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercédès and his father could have joined him				81.63981297746504
consent then i beg you madame to write at the bottom of this schedule which has been drawn up by mazarin as you see i consent to ratify the treaty proposed by the parisians anne was caught she could not draw back she signed but scarcely had she done so when pride burst forth and she began to weep				6107.278397828924
alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villefort s departure				1773.4056992407482
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere				11166.345164046706
fie pardon my dear aramis but i thought you carried your eyes higher higher				14320.6525385725
it was too warm in the room was it not count she asked				1085.1462017303327
we profited by this respite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere				11950.242969674098
a man enveloped in a cloak came out immediately and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal after which he mounted his horse and set off in the direction of surgères which was likewise the way to paris				466.2275521658977
as things are turning out i foresee that we must give battle to london to the provinces to all england and certainly in the end we can t fail to be beaten we ought to witness this great tragedy even to its last scene said athos				135.53775814511928
no i make you my lieutenant general said the king				417.07679229923474
yes replied the old man				143.29094283304138
the only thing i recollect is that i awoke in bed in a round chamber the furniture of which was sumptuous and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling				8996.16111599784
political judgments are generally vain formalities for the same passions which give rise to the accusation ordain to the condemnation				28685.602462203322
carriages now arrived in crowds those of the marechal de villeroy guitant villequier and comminges came into the line				3321.8125999604877
we must let them leave the village and ride after us on the northern road and when they have passed we will take the opposite direction there was a stream close by and a bridge across it				90.24904480741866
the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices one deep whisper intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle				5993.135319873192
i have however a wish to go and pass a day at blois				2398.3928582454314
we shall descend by the first window in the gallery what next sign your name my lord the duke signed				6255.818091049145
well here we are at last said one of them				135.41618010081058
five answered groslow one every two hours d artagnan glanced at athos and aramis and for the first time replied to porthos s nudge of the knee by a nudge responsive				59551.71037422893
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger				4922.21757622473
he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him				82.52377340685752
how sir said planchet is it you eh				3789.8538706775553
you here said château renaud passing his arms through the young captain s are you a friend of villefort s				1067.5851896081604
the tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot and sent la houdinière his captain of the guards to inquire what was going on				660.9102235399856
these steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards appeared				920.7816869871291
athos s idea cried aramis and d artagnan at the same time				384.1280247955136
it was a very near thing but he is not dead as he said this d artagnan gave a glance at parry who was standing in front of the king to show him that the news was meant for him				81.19533043004363
hallo dantès				284.10082293255255
how could i then return to brussels				7242.6678390672005
but he added in a despairing tone perhaps no one will dare to come for it is known that the spaniards are ranging through the country and i shall die without absolution				56104.795983505275
his complexion was pale not of that deadly pallor which is a kind of neutral beauty but of a bilious yellow hue his colorless hair was short and scarcely extended beyond the circle formed by the hat around his head and his light blue eyes seemed destitute of any expression				3264.9620487036523
my father advised me to stoop to nobody but the king the cardinal and yourself whom he considered the first three personages in france d artagnan added m de tréville to the others as may be perceived but he thought this addition would do no harm				88715.88141014602
but to die				1661.4179958915652
what joy for my lord and master du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds thou good mousqueton				1674.8750796291326
i was saying it was very interesting what was all you were showing me				119.0920515054915
tis then all settled				4008.6978147765117
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty				4972.508148068991
at length he found himself at the foot of a staircase and he mechanically lifted his foot five or six times				2614.3058974087835
after this he took from his cupboard the bank notes and gold he had put there thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers and the other into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the door disappeared in the darkness of the night				1174.0251652894924
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from her yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too late perhaps silence laporte you may be overheard				29221.708681552533
during the first act the countess g entered				575.5958743913694
are you no longer my master or have i ceased to be your slave monte cristo returned her smile				547.4286031790081
he considered himself an outraged betrayed and ridiculed lover				6080.632031574656
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns				15141.672557625314
and you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the stairs				2734.338417324423
this second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the ground where he was writhing in agony				16843.738693240164
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger				2128.3882237085595
he saw her get into her carriage and heard her order the coachman to drive to st germain				1896.6001810291486
bernouin bernouin entered				497.97521575578344
my dear count if you tell me many more marvellous things i warn you i shall not believe them i countenance nothing that is marvellous m albert				815.9400913073591
i wish to thank them all at once				2204.4790005542313
before or after whichever you please opposite the scaffold the scaffold forms part of the fête count i have reflected on the matter said franz i thank you for your courtesy but i shall content myself with accepting a place in your carriage and at your window at the rospoli palace and i leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the piazza del popolo but i warn you you will lose a very curious sight returned the count				273.83375031626485
one said the count mysteriously his eyes fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a death				756.283315101383
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle				2814.3906959803126
i will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will submit to them				140.04064168382237
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars née hermine de servieux albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friend s conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the count s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess				15424.067408529108
we will take possession of it and cut the cable				49649.85834239173
as i said monsieur lubin did not know me and told me our adventure from one end to the other well done planchet				1184.3242785981777
the cardinal s refusal to pay the pension was known about the town in half an hour and he was abused with wit and vehemence				18707.779219990363
i think he has not been arrested and as i am his wife s confessor if she knows where he is i shall know it too very well sir find this man and when you have found him bring him to me we will be with you at six o clock my lord go my dear curate and may god assist you and you sir continued gondy turning to the curate of st sulpice				11237.82581943094
the nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question				1765.468712371953
porthos bowed as if in assent				1618.38033855237
ay said porthos the thing would not be impossible with a good plan i have none said athos but d artagnan will discover one d artagnan shrugged his shoulders and they proceeded				2841.4201783119347
run for help cried grimaud and i will remain beside him here the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husband s cries				21439.20822224722
at eight o clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition				9148.816926822861
ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag				11427.964586969812
and then the baroness remembered that she had felt no pity for poor mercédès who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son				785.0640332634728
the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king				650.2345011631236
he aimed a terrible blow at d artagnan who avoided it by springing to one side but by this movement he left a passage free to the bandit who darted off toward the bastion				3118.8255760012376
ma foi said monte cristo after the first compliments were over what is the matter with you m de villefort				430.9776581520283
reverend sir murmured caderousse seeking to regain the window which the count pitilessly blocked reverend sir i don t know believe me i take my oath a pane of glass out continued the count a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire half forced it is tolerably evident caderousse was choking he looked around for some corner to hide in some way of escape				1995.3535780297655
a terrible vision the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a moment				757.8167983879763
i have one but not one from cardinal mazarin enter and ask for monsieur bernouin said the porter opening the door of the third room				191.63240789792778
de sévigné				76990.34318939455
on reaching the palace d artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay				5374.035999147199
since you demand my resignation i retire then said aramis in his neighbor s ear the conferences are over				1847.9681235075832
he would extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him				90.49419815793088
the bed was the only one in the apartment which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom				2990.2943252645346
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens albert approached				2751.052293173973
i am at the command of the committee and even claim the honor of being heard				1491.7218397339136
when the name of colonel fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial				4276.529367630951
come tell me his name remember that his name is all my secret yet i must know his name yes you must see what confidence i have in you you overwhelm me with joy				1774.181307597567
he then saw the great aqueducts those stone phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the right hand now they were on the left				1527.6250230205026
i found the tenant				13603.282545631515
an instant after bazin made his appearance at the door				366.6250964394809
the truth was that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such trial and half by persuasion and half by force he had removed teresa toward another part of the garden				1376.6166851254156
what ails you baron he exclaimed				1452.247414600081
went without recompense the duke s endeavors evinced the best intention in the world but one of the precautions taken at vincennes was that of allowing prisoners to keep no money				954.6122497393004
bonacieux was known to belong to the queen the duke wore the uniform of the musketeers of m de tréville who as we have said were that evening on guard				1847.6764759875432
dantès redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods				7933.665119048091
the young man read valentine s letter twenty times in the course of the day				464.3476805064188
to be decapitated				66223.45761542274
ordinarily prisoners were interrogated in their cells but they did not do so with m bonacieux				4138.516110168092
there only then remained porthos and bicarat				12391.671738670148
if she had been a great lady she would have fainted but as she was only a procurator s wife she contented herself saying to the musketeer with concentrated fury eh monsieur porthos you don t offer me any holy water porthos at the sound of that voice started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years				997.1707394550797
that which i have to say is too long and above all too secret well what is to be done if monsieur chevalier would follow me said kitty timidly				3289.025864850394
well his love is half real half fanciful				66490.82836377887
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his box but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse and held them in his iron grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his companion				1242.7157185445608
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four years afterwards this colossus of power would be overthrown				51384.3930129738
i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side				1511.0722247523067
you would wish a notary to be sent for then said valentine				195.60499570104497
so now you are both forewarned the young men bowed and quitted the box				1071.8239062878433
in an hour hence i shall be with the comte de la fere and to morrow your majesty shall have a definite reply the queen tendered her hand to lord de winter who kissing it respectfully went out and traversed alone and unconducted those large dark and deserted apartments brushing away tears which blase as he was by fifty years spent as a courtier he could not withhold at the spectacle of royal distress so dignified yet so intense				53668.37696119393
well sir what you tell me is impossible				1734.3125586085234
but we have not as yet declared war perhaps we shall have to make certain conditions therefore a solemn conference is indispensable for my own part i demand it said aramis				236.09434476381634
as d artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself porthos believed he had not been seen				2822.4623369907563
the closet into which d artagnan and porthos had been ushered was separated from the drawing room where the queen was by tapestried curtains only and this thin partition enabled them to hear all that passed in the adjoining room whilst the aperture between the two hangings small as it was permitted them to see				1099.231985190564
i sounded all the walls in the hopes of discovering a door but everywhere the walls returned a full and flat sound				2673.813743955615
it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate				38326.4658281089
you must teach me a small part of what you know said dantès if only to prevent your growing weary of me				130.07765751102042
and now let everyone retire must i go too asked valentine timidly				3703.4003249581574
they then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity				1184.985761882488
ma madame cried he is that you				127.44596739310062
soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel which came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door				345.50461102781145
the first year he offered government a million of francs for his release the second two the third three and so on progressively				27645.08875078218
if he were afterwards to marry mademoiselle danglars you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me besides i may not be there myself where at your ball why should you not be there because you have not yet invited me but i come expressly for that purpose you are very kind but i may be prevented if i tell you one thing you will be so amiable as to set aside all impediments tell me what it is my mother begs you to come the comtesse de morcerf said monte cristo starting				7563.890094969692
your honor cried planchet i ve a man behind me d artagnan turned around and plainly saw two human forms on planchet s horse				945.1166374918361

he did not take in the paper containing the defamatory article and had passed the morning in writing letters and in trying a horse				900.4718565407695
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak				1288.4039913712265
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose				3114.821707070606
oh the deuce				3746.372365478566

yes said aramis				19.28969707618323
no i repeat again that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almighty s pleasure dantès held down his head that the other might not see how joy at the thought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the abbé s plans				2893.781117393471

this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour				1618.003790870554
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant who both knew what his wishes were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest				28102.483806418895
then new concessions to the people then a constitution then liberty				1715.7909553777567
how fine it is to be called condé and to be so worthy of such a name he was calm and radiant was he not as calm as at parade radiant as at a fete				77660.14758337542
the guardsmen imagining this to be caused by some unexpected attack either of the besieged or the english sprang to their swords				2207.4484728139
i never go there why what in the world cried aramis is that animal bazin doing				2180.7386696588264

mazarin and guitant conversed together in whispers				19810.2593348095

albert had left the count to speak to his mother danglars to converse with young cavalcanti monte cristo was for an instant alone				994.4105545353439
monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him				67.4492668693367
a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped peppino opened the door and the count and franz alighted				6342.932218512178
the gate once closed and debray and the baroness alone in the court he asked what was the matter with you hermine				15518.46672684445
at length villefort the most composed of all spoke sir said he to maximilian you say you loved valentine that you were betrothed to her				200.89455157473364
i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses				1663.4124322399582
you arrive and your presence was likely to afford me delightful company yet i expect in all probability to quit the convent at any moment how you are going soon asked milady				558.2855592430398
our gascon knew by the first glance of his eye that his billet had been delivered and that this billet had had its effect				1628.9142758983908
any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of m de villefort insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition these words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before				1129.9311661438858
bonacieux who willingly took it half laughing half trembling and both gained the top of rue de la harpe				17185.176236070118

what is the matter				493.34634487266436
now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast				1837.6730044252818
it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious cried d artagnan but the queen whom the king abandons whom the cardinal persecutes and who sees the heads of all her friends fall one after the other why does she love what we hate most in the world the spaniards and the english spain is her country replied d artagnan and it is very natural that she should love the spanish who are the children of the same soil as herself				956.252357584871
kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man and heaved a deep sigh				667.1834924808533
m de tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news				2450.116136598688
the abbé was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding				38795.187451152124
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations				26007.23547835841
but how do you mean to pass your time till i come back				1163.0822016518816
but said the abbé i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn				831.497635181493
d artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting yes count nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since then said athos in a tone of delight he is well				601.8235719955007
five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the officer when the door opened and a new personage entered				602.7115433733603
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then morrel stretched his arms towards her sometimes mere strangers like the count of monte cristo came to visit her even the very furniture in these moments of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three o clock in the morning when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young girl from which she did not awake till daylight				24813.082665273425
you have a longboat that in which we came it appeared light and well constructed quite a canoe fasten it to the poop with a rope put the oars into it so that it may follow in the track and there will be nothing to do except to cut the cord				17446.466829337813
brave as you are and strong as you are you could not kill them all tis true answered porthos rising on his saddle in order that he might appraise the immense crowd there are a lot of them i think i should like the other fellow better than this one said mazarin to himself and he threw himself back in his carriage				1191.5908343934905
and of what malady it is feared that it may be the smallpox sir replied porthos desirous of taking his turn in the conversation and what is serious is that it will certainly spoil his face the smallpox				39794.35134228991
spectre against spectre he murmured in a low voice as he concluded his sentence				27818.793655626327
do you understand me				64.57206131364214
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength				1408.6575490635748
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did				3056.370580132195
but nothing could be farther from his thoughts				954.6973749232583
it was nearly three days since i had eaten or drunk anything				1822.0310492728963
he will perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the money itself seeing that i sacrifice everything in order to keep my word with him				75.36811875790532
the matter was arranged as d artagnan had suggested and when he returned he found the king already seated at his little table where parry waited on him harrison and his officers sitting together at another table and in a corner places reserved for himself and his companions				901.1844772048443
now do you know baron i have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the world did not know who the countess g was ah to be sure replied château renaud the lovely venetian is it not herself at this moment the countess perceived albert and returned his salutation with a smile				496.0867793314184
the two friends after a cordial pressure of the hands separated				5176.565316164028
chance is so capricious				48944.620688941606
he then said it is time to start the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o clock but perhaps valentine will not wait for that consequently morrel having left the rue meslay at half past eight by his timepiece entered the clover field while the clock of saint philippe du roule was striking eight				7383.002604533342
so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets				51403.704207311785
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father				532.4645726050948
he took the money which athos offered to him and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands suddenly cried out that it was bad and that he would have him and his companions arrested as forgers				65497.32591283718
vampa approached the corpse and recognized cucumetto				3813.590628633285
while he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need he caught a glance from athos				305.37060762665516
he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed				63298.82849861211
but know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your husband who has but the commencement of the art for generally husbands will not see you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the women of the world				690.5714580919349

you know one can not change his nature he said				391.34022115393924

rochefort all is not lost and perhaps perhaps everything is for the best the fact is that i do not doubt your eminence s genius will repair the blunders of his agent is that it that is exactly what i was going to say if your eminence had let me finish my sentence meanwhile do you know where the duchesse de chevreuse and the duke of buckingham are now concealed no monseigneur my people could tell me nothing on that head but i know you monseigneur yes or at least i guess				18811.885344773447

yes yes replied dantès eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé				1102.377211032369

the prisoner happened to remark among the guards one man with a very good countenance and he favored this man the more as grimaud became the more and more odious to him				82.8574292023717

the house with kitchens and cellars below had above the ground floor two stories and attics				39863.40583441566
but asked madame danglars looking at her husband with uneasiness how could that prevent m de villefort in this simple way madame replied monte cristo the waistcoat and the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence i therefore sent them to the king s attorney				3845.3194829964204

we have already wasted too much the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went out				427.6873870933042

although d artagnan did not at all know the queen he soon distinguished her voice from the others at first by a slightly foreign accent and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon all royal words				729.6111010506139
she cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was captain gaumard giving orders and good old penelon making signals to m morrel				743.3535125992655
the king went away enchanted				111536.85649884066

come exclaimed aramis				19.72762428093056
she therefore took leave of the abbess and went to bed softly rocked by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought to her thoughts				955.6269622074266

the four countenances expressed four different feelings that of porthos tranquillity that of d artagnan hope that of aramis uneasiness that of athos carelessness				8138.833634985363
three things were especially urged upon the officers who were to see that the soldiers observed them scrupulously the first that the different corps should so march that cavalry and infantry should be on the same line and that each body should protect its gaps the second to go to the charge no faster than a walk the third to let the enemy fire first				1044.3883238058356

cries were heard from the camp come down				1232.561030644072
mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed				909.4937676622357
he felt a slight disappointment however when he saw that this place was already taken by a compeer named mousqueton and when porthos signified to him that the state of his household though great would not support two servants and that he must enter into the service of d artagnan				219.04025455562248
the cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of anne				5011.952511768028
before closing the door he turned around once more and said not a movement not a word let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the power of helping you and with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the door which noiselessly closed after him				72.39628869263115
morcerf and château renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission				4971.118891256149
on recovering the use of their limbs and tongues they could of course tell nothing but what they knew that they had been seized stripped and bound				70593.26467315132
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it				95.39651519263344
i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an enemy here an enemy cried mercédès with an angry look at her cousin				11832.901831553638
you have seen my dear albert i ask the question as a mother you have seen m de monte cristo in his house you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the world more tact than is usual at your age do you think the count is really what he appears to be what does he appear to be why you have just said a man of high distinction i told you my dear mother he was esteemed such but what is your own opinion albert i must tell you that i have not come to any decided opinion respecting him but i think him a maltese i do not ask you of his origin but what he is ah				253.85704597397796
how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme				177.89293981960088

your excellencies permit it asked the host				755.8888953452772

franz continued it was as we said the fifth of february				14911.614816851465

we have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin				4008.594595317426
still in spite of all you must admit that this count of monte cristo is a most singular personage he is a philanthropist answered the other and no doubt his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the interests of virtue and humanity				9633.944433358225
to be sure we will replied aramis and porthos with admirable promptness and decision as if that were the simplest thing in the world to be sure we will get you out but meantime as we are to set off the day after tomorrow you would do much better not to risk this bastille let us do better than that said athos do not let us leave him during the whole evening				462.14934650170204

in conscience i can not kill him and yet added he with a coldly menacing expression he annoys me				100.7828263879863

monsieur d artagnan he said you are to take this dispatch to the bastile and bring back here the person it concerns				14350.127836839896
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion				1977.6828261254302
humph murmured athos it is certainly she and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat he advanced toward milady				935.8038275216833
when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls				98858.59455718339

the epithet as may be easily understood resounded to the very bottom of d artagnan s heart				416.1405340770236
now we discover our error a title and promotion attach you to the government we wish to overturn				46531.40979562048
so d artagnan resumed you will not become a partisan of mazarin s nor you of the prince de condé no let us belong to no party but remain friends let us be neither cardinalists nor frondists adieu then and d artagnan poured out a glass of wine				1093.5705439060382
why your excellency returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his hands with infinite complacency i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests wherever i go				1362.29570594864
vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of madame de villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure				1443.3748053895808
m de villefort notwithstanding his self control was visibly affected and when monte cristo touched his hand he felt it tremble				4371.335920885162
cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this look from teresa showed to him that she was a worthy daughter of eve and he returned to the forest pausing several times on his way under the pretext of saluting his protectors				75492.79120508362
they know that i am intimate with you that you are in fact one of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they will not find you at my house they will certainly ask me why i did not invite you				154.64762463649572
edmond was intensely interested				72327.8723652632
how many people thought he and not one true friend and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said respect to fallen majesty the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart				418.23088244029543
in a court of justice that is called an alibi d artagnan found his advice prudent				11965.649753063566
i must have left it in my room she said				425.4174924960546
it appeared to him that something might have happened at the pavilion in his absence and that fresh information awaited him				79.00028995898215
besides the scriptures say confess yourselves to one another and i confess to you d artagnan and i give you absolution beforehand				19107.85609112006
the order is positive				16290.564752043929
from the manner in which you walked and talked together one would have thought you were two school girls telling your secrets to each other we were having a confidential conversation returned valentine she was owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with m de morcerf and i on the other hand was confessing to her how wretched it made me to think of marrying m d épinay dear valentine that will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed between me and eugénie as in speaking of the man whom i could not love my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed ah how good you are to say so valentine				845.0639523427993
villefort stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his child lying no doubt asleep on the sofa				38524.90124330803
do you understand that my dear franz no horses he said but can t we have post horses they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting what are we to say to this asked franz				789.9596052220534

i am temporarily commander of the pharaon with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to hold his tongue				2629.1236610018
he then asked with whom he played				24845.73623611389
this battle of folly and flame continued for two hours the corso was light as day the features of the spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible				3116.8036778536452
for you and your comrades this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm				8896.37391884733

he stooped down picked up the bag of money and placed it between his teeth				2915.747305872826
it is no affair of mine i know not why you meddle said fernand seizing his arm but this i know you have some motive of personal hatred against dantès for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others i				785.1808384352167
ever since valentine s dowry had been mentioned morrel had been silent and sad				7056.018092436783
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted				8610.778700952042
i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume				3796.2094949789525
dantès waited only to get breath and then dived in order to avoid being seen				2799.4803850469552
but to grieve my father to disturb my grandmother s last moments never you are right said morrel calmly				2310.350170060819

yes but he couldn t understand what it meant for he had spent that night with a dying person and marie michon had left his house before his return you must know monsieur that marie michon when she returned to france in immediately sought for information about that child as a fugitive she could not take care of it but on her return she wished to have it near her and what said the abbé asked athos				195.92377814199745
he had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort				2014.9349091654576
mercédès was the only one awake in the whole settlement				45066.68288485843
the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the custom house officers was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this time in consequence of the fair at beaucaire				5258.84160226591
my dear d artagnan said aramis don t be too angry with me i beg				18121.18956759069
but no				522.0318371127075
because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride				2997.034932719705

therefore let us separate				4189.608403771413
which is to recover a lost and adored son a lost and adored son stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies at the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven				768.0278594713192
the other sailor had already seated himself on the port side and was ready to row				45233.750069353715
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last those are kind and cheering words				706.265929003717

i killed one man if i recollect rightly replied d artagnan with a look of inquiry directed to athos another i disarmed or wounded i don t remember which wounded said athos it was a phenomenon of skill the young man would willingly have prolonged this conversation far into the night but athos pointed out to him that his guest must need repose				3373.6055083265724
no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain to every argument they replied we must go for death is in this house they all left in spite of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a master and mistress and especially mademoiselle valentine so good so kind and so gentle				50524.20587627982
meanwhile m de villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at m d avrigny s door				334.49664134109673
haul taut they obeyed				1446.7767217742448
where is the child villefort shrugged his shoulders				1287.1267583618185
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of war come answered mazarin i see it will be necessary for me to capitulate before a siege yes the conditions will be better than afterward ah my lord				614.9407705994264
milady uttered a frightful shriek and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges				24330.39285637362
they will know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial position and am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner the dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which debray had spoken				4344.521206090989
then not a word but set to work they went on through the darkness silent as phantoms they saw a light glimmering in the midst of some trees				2155.678671665828

how do you explain the influence the count evidently possessed over those ruffians my good friend as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my life for my own idea was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me piastres which being translated means neither more nor less than livres of our money a sum at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added albert with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own country talking of countries replied franz of what country is the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy				64678.04242723095

danglars had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial box declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the baroness had therefore despatched a note to lucien debray bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with eugénie to the opera				2798.5928197560274

yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by bandits there are no bandits cried debray				623.9828564081367
upon gaining this advantage d artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman				531.3602435946177
that last order is useless interrupted d artagnan there are loaded pistols in your holsters bazin sighed				3034.0610448754965

they were listened to with great politeness by the duke who held out hopes of easier measures promised to speak in their behalf to the queen and dismissed them with the ordinary expression of royalty we will see what we can do two days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal and their spokesman addressed mazarin with so much fearlessness and determination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation away with the same answer as it had received from the duke of orleans that he would see what could be done and in accordance with that intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent of finance was summoned				70949.15284662008
move on then and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded				2910.728344129308
before god and before men said he i accuse this woman of having poisoned constance bonacieux who died yesterday evening he turned towards porthos and aramis				284.1634168880063
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle				5935.23872206187
what were you doing at the moment you were arrested i was at the festival of my marriage monsieur said the young man his voice slightly tremulous so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of m de villefort and the radiant face of mercédès				1505.425877005955

oh sir she stammered i beseech you do not believe appearances are you then a coward cried villefort in a contemptuous voice				491.424610054602
only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your beautiful eyes who told you that i had been weeping said she				205.83394662184187
old dantès however sprang forward				697.1149653491279
permit me to assure your excellency said bertuccio that the horses you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours monte cristo shrugged his shoulders				1270.4866371054793
he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his family				4040.4274049623555

it was you who were behind my bed curtains that night the parisians wished to see me asleep and if the king permits me returned the gascon i shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered sir said mazarin to porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us kill as many as i could my lord hem				11532.906152296566
there do you see madame he recognizes you and bows the baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner				1003.8799982675079

and stopped in the yard				14435.421071392777
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horses one for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern				17543.92201272328
at this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard				1483.0973575575558
beauchamp repeated the name to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave orders for him to be admitted				3756.830285145668
you mentioned a fowl i think yes a fowl peppino turning around shouted a fowl for his excellency his voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and half naked young man appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head without the assistance of his hands				521.5148288571154
bazin felt some one pulling his sleeve				64738.642314663084
yes sire yes it is the same and your majesty has a good memory come how shall we decide said the king				424.98015949071504

what a flavor cried d artagnan ah				206.47723862139418
at the sight of these men the englishman started and advanced a step then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment				754.4895382853947
is supper ready signor pastrini yes your excellency well then let us sup but the carriage and horses said franz				866.0446963316809
mercédès drew near and plucked the fruit				4461.248493295082
porthos in order to make a greater display had that evening borrowed planchet				1226.7310537541325
she was branded athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand				297.9089295219599
ah said milady listening in her turn to the noise of felton s steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of lord de winter at length you are mine then her brow darkened				56825.07254819963
why yourself to be sure				3690.1338382193876
still further monsieur de tréville gains ten thousand crowns a year he is therefore a great noble				43972.69860234629
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now noirtier s expression could not be understood				2735.2838605044913
wait a moment said athos perhaps they do not recognize your majesty s voice and await the order of their captain have they not heard that of their colonel				109960.42683205761
perhaps not so great as you think porthos you know the proverb all roads lead to rome but how is it that we are incurring greater risks than athos and aramis asked porthos				152.26833136071158
but madame replied the count continuing the conversation and looking by turns at madame de villefort and valentine have i not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before				1101.090109686885
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice				9696.52171734292
he found tréville in a joyful mood				7374.115200313637
as he approached carlini raised his head and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man s eyes				406.86250534015323
do you permit me to return yes to morrow the cardinal took the queen s hand and pressed it with an air of gallantry to his lips				721.3409482447947
oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things what did you please to say sir asked caderousse				316.5535882021792
at the same moment a violent crash was heard and cries of distress				7373.805776617648
count added mercédès with a supplicating glance there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal friends of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof i know it madame replied the count but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with one another but said the countess breathlessly with her eyes fixed on monte cristo whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands we are friends are we not the count became pale as death the blood rushed to his heart and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his eyes swam like those of a man suddenly dazzled				16981.14054167209
exactly like me				82.92750916753924
this was divided into three compartments one which was covered by the floor of that room in which athos porthos and aramis were to pass the night the second was to serve as the sleeping room for the servants the third under the prow of the ship was under the temporary cabin in which mordaunt was concealed				11600.027422367582
have you decided said she				33.89597772616319
now the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust yet five minutes afterwards the rabbit was dead				491.4789775091504
caderousse who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his arm tried to draw back then clasping his hands and raising them with a desperate effort oh my god my god said he pardon me for having denied thee thou dost exist thou art indeed man s father in heaven and his judge on earth				1533.7648682097808
alas said athos we depart alone yes but all four together and without a scratch which is a consolation we are not yet at our destination observed the prudent d artagnan beware of misadventure ah my friend cried porthos like the crows you always bring bad omens				49143.21400837902
two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard				7566.371941823891
it was the first time one of these visions had ever addressed her in a living voice and she was about to utter an exclamation				14751.219545909897
charles who is my prisoner may still have friends but i have none and with a deep sigh he again sank into the reverie that had been interrupted by mordaunt				2027.5868317801041
i answer for all that the prince said				484.33343755496037
employ me in any other way employ me even actively but let it be on the high roads my dear monsieur de rochefort mazarin replied in a tone of raillery you think yourself still a young man your spirit is that of the phoenix but your strength fails you				179.2626113737061
somebody he perceived was in the courtyard moving stealthily				62131.37526998341
i really don t know what hotel it is all i do know is that i observed some suspicious looking people go in there nonsense exclaimed guitant with a burst of laughter those men must be poets come guitant speak if you please respectfully of these gentlemen said mazarin don t you know that i was in my youth a poet				29009.349653766105
monte cristo appeared to be unconscious of what passed				2437.0253108403053
mademoiselle paulet has observed you vicomte go and bow to her don t try to appear anything but what you are a true country youth on no account speak to her of henry iv when shall we two walk together athos then said to aramis				171.54669425702414
but no his heart is beating				50974.015088969856
m de tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were dead				484.59355503033674
then morrel came out from his hiding place with a beating heart and looked through the small opening in the gate there was yet no one to be seen				2794.541625690515
athos went toward the house while the mendicant who had received his reward left as fast as his legs could carry him				81.64732660020584
but replied the owner glancing after dantès who was watching the anchoring of his vessel it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say danglars to understand his business for our friend edmond seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from anyone yes said danglars darting at edmond a look gleaming with hate				17099.495469805162
on the floor above were similar rooms with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three rooms were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom				2958.2466055725154
your very devoted husband baron danglars the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his self control change color once or twice				6609.975460362265
it seems that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless no that his style of writing is very good this must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose heads he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out albert laughed				1648.803978944706
he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball				4038.8324735762353
i think he is about to leave paris he was going to his banker his banker				2842.2535607573836
i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds well said aramis what do you say to that i say my dear d herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan the division being made by the light of bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis				2964.9022482724954
the morning was beautiful and in this early springtime the birds sang on the trees and the sunbeams shone through the misty glades like curtains of golden gauze				43523.77843264796
all his funds amounted to or francs his bills receivable up to the to or which making the best of everything gave him francs to meet debts amounting to francs				728.1405959708555
there was no longer any doubt the treasure was there no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket				6509.750469394037
what art thou about				5337.307631260569
what do you mean other men may have entered before them and waited for them we can find out said grimaud				148.38315611823762
a merry morning to you sunshine				98950.84233667569
i have heard that she met with a strange adventure in i don t know what village with i don t know what curé of whom she asked hospitality and who having but one chamber and taking her for a cavalier offered to share it with her				204.2113920892502
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur				2747.59917054589
i have at length then intelligence of you				185.4721400130996
between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot and displayed its flexible stem and fan shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub tropical sun				2937.2751135111703
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable				5795.919200569685
have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today a fine pleasure indeed monsieur				1460.5998655003932
gracious heavens exclaimed dantès what is the matter				501.80478723443156
pray be assured of that franz took his hat and went away in haste				1372.2740968986966
you succeeded and then god snatched it from you and brought you to justice it was not i who wished to kill the jew said caderousse it was la carconte yes said monte cristo and god i can not say in justice for his justice would have slain you but god in his mercy spared your life pardieu to transport me for life how merciful you thought it a mercy then miserable wretch				5878.714302231565
nothing at all that s a capital arrangement				18558.937191897818
it was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury				57028.930601862136
monsieur d artagnan cried mousqueton his fat cheeks swelling out and his whole frame perspiring with joy monsieur d artagnan				109.85502363340333
did you ever hear of such an idea monte cristo closed his eyes and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of death had touched his face				949.2229943404532
the sign of the red dovecot meanwhile the king who with more reason than the cardinal showed his hatred for buckingham although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive the english from the isle of ré and afterward to press the siege of la rochelle but notwithstanding his earnest wish he was delayed by the dissensions which broke out between mm				8756.652777396448
into the service the king s service mousqueton trembled even his fat smooth cheeks shook as he spoke and he looked at d artagnan with an air of reproach he staggered and his voice was almost choked				11000.799052818864
no sir before all who are here albert s witnesses looked at each other				989.7159889831619
an hour had passed since the sun had set when franz fancied he saw at a quarter of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great light appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the fire was not a meteor				16248.516840384496
thou alone on the contrary knowest how to choose thy object and to gain it stealthily the friends embraced				11434.287498170956
at this sound as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless				1695.0091217045365
the carriage is going one way to the piazza del popolo and we will go another and if you please by the corso				15496.490151847347
château renaud returned debray you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint germain do not pay any attention to him count live in the chaussée d antin that s the real centre of paris boulevard de l opéra said beauchamp the second floor a house with a balcony				7816.305842785711
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded name of noirtier he had nothing to apprehend				28269.867764095146
presently it sounded one o clock				968.2891194092015
but young as you are and scarcely entering into the world you have powerful enemies if you do not take great heed they will destroy you alas monseigneur replied the young man very easily no doubt for they are strong and well supported while i am alone yes that s true but alone as you are you have done much already and will do still more i don t doubt				1859.6789449017938
if it were so with m morrel unfortunately replied the count i am witness that m morrel can not give up his horse his honor being engaged in keeping it how so he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six months				2590.3556867969874
you spent it as you pleased that was your business				5818.492806933331
monte cristo allowed a short time to elapse and then said it is singular baron but the same idea came across me the first time i came here it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands				500.84213457180704
an unknown person had been with him that morning and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques unfortunately the general s valet who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered heard the street mentioned but did not catch the number as the police minister related this to the king villefort who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker s lips turned alternately red and pale				809.6201209808894
two hundred and eighty seven thousand five hundred francs repeated he				654.9957043491435
monte cristo raised his head once more and this time he was calm as a child awaking from its sleep				1528.1765428340962
charming said mazarin				161.40560438707126
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant				6595.278838082493
madame de villefort was dead				468.83702024625694
not another step he said or you are a dead man what then said vampa raising his hand with a gesture of disdain while teresa no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him do wolves rend each other who are you inquired the sentinel				3304.5070968461805
i am not a priest you are not a priest cried the executioner				897.1486035842785
now said mordaunt are you not afraid that they will recognize you there is no danger dressed as i am in this pilot coat on a night as dark as this				1342.8941258014147
because they have but fulfilled the mission confided to them by queen henrietta and we have betrayed that confided to us by mazarin because going hence as emissaries to cromwell we became partisans of king charles because instead of helping cut off the royal head condemned by those fellows called mazarin cromwell joyce bridge fairfax etc we very nearly succeeded in saving it upon my word that is true said porthos but how can you suppose my dear friend that in the midst of his great preoccupations general cromwell has had time to think cromwell thinks of everything cromwell has time for everything and believe me dear friend we ought not to lose our time it is precious				36334.555909923016
after some hours of repose the sleepers were aroused by athos				395.4763924248658
what was it then				800.5209314410142
at daybreak he awoke and took a turn around his room				201.44958088918932
quite sir my master has ordered his horses at eight o clock precisely very good replied albert that is all i wished to know then turning towards beauchamp if you have anything to attend to beauchamp do it directly if you have any appointment for this evening defer it till tomorrow				1454.5774180987603
aramis opened the gate and faced around in order that d artagnan and porthos might enter				1916.787479960518
in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments there had been no fixed meeting between them				134.10831377367708
the old man remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune hung over his head				513.4613187355083
the swiss became as purple as a peony				44002.44102045245
let us try and overtake this gentleman said raoul to olivain like ourselves he is on his way to join the army and may prove agreeable company it was about four o clock in the afternoon when raoul arrived at compiegne there he dined heartily and again inquired about the young gentleman who was in advance of them				120.78591718334101
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir				364.683455371691
he remembered that the old association of musketeers was composed of four persons				21516.715737135906
grimaud begins his functions				39472.58367292091
and besides if it is not the prince then monsieur de gondy but monsieur de gondy is to be made a cardinal they are soliciting the hat for him and are there no cardinals that can fight				1170.8161987893704

standing well at court whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a man of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by others without being really liked by anybody m de villefort held a high position in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a molé				85816.80191103024
and then you know he said an idea a supposition is sufficient well said monte cristo you may believe me if you like but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house take care said madame de villefort the king s attorney is here ah replied monte cristo since that is the case i will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration your declaration said villefort				338.04571991082327
he insisted on being introduced saying that although he was not a deputy from monsieur de conti or monsieur de beaufort or monsieur de bouillon or monsieur d elbeuf or the coadjutor or madame de longueville or broussel or the parliament and although he had come on his own private account he nevertheless had things to say to her majesty of the utmost importance				4506.163170171298
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock				16974.404975175366
tell us about it said athos palpitating				85626.65007377788
killed him or poniarded him sir as is most agreeable to you i did not know that replied m de tréville in a somewhat softened tone				739.3024958928768
he resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal and fell upon the body of his comrade as if he were dead				484.69639307576426
albert was charmed with the count s manners and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman by reason of his varied knowledge				10099.455376526683
although master of himself monte cristo scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to look upon the noble stranger as monte cristo was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and one nights				1709.9046476820727
athos smiled				622.0886337429998
this could not then be a military ambuscade as the ball was not of the regular caliber				53434.67773459048
as for me i remain in my humility and indolence				64028.85248368442
the president looked at his auditors				12112.771684437088
i thought i did replied athos but no doubt i was mistaken and he returned d artagnan the ring without however ceasing to look at it				92.13482229321933
why do you call me baron said danglars you know that i care nothing for my title				3637.92651262374
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound silence and laid rita at the captain s feet				1008.6484820515589
but all my fortune is in england				917.9335092976524
na ne ni no yes yes yes said the old man s eye				1481.8892520326892
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent				5822.889233199743
monte cristo although apparently indifferent had not lost one word of this conversation and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary				11993.57157772069
yet they will forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like faria as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought				2621.5249236050413
i shall not go why asked porthos				22.532710679830988
of course they will do so as honorable gentlemen and the best proof i can furnish is this so saying he threw his hat on the ground pushed back his chair to the wall and bowed to mordaunt with true french grace				13553.298431843235
this was the same emery who became eventually superintendent of finance				30512.318695381513
i have a letter to give you from the count from the count murmured the two young people				1115.7834131473887
the rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion				3070.1037322849943
his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was for andrea				1841.2288419231627
but let us leave off this strain sir if the tone of it is displeasing to you i am no more disturbed by your justice than are you by my second sight no no by no means said villefort who was afraid of seeming to abandon his ground				1469.5594392380324
oh father said she clasping her hands forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings morrel again changed color				6010.036977152565
he was a clever man				192.63909831685055
dantès ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in order to leave la pianosa to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots				47673.045316193005
well said aramis beaten by fate beaten said athos				13.069481249167152
keep the lieutenancy my dear keep it the young man then entered the apartment of aramis				404.70004843773825
i can not stay here any longer with all my heart replied danglars pleased to find the other so tractable				76430.84153236228
porthos and i will stay here the friends obeyed				1546.338404915351
but tell me well what do you wish to know will not the count of monte cristo be here tonight seventeen replied albert				531.3886220509537
i was expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table				680.1615096223538
these things always come on us more severely when they come suddenly ah ma foi under any circumstances said caderousse who drank as he spoke and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect under any circumstances fernand is not the only person put out by the fortunate arrival of dantès is he danglars no you are right and i should say that would bring him ill luck well never mind answered caderousse pouring out a glass of wine for fernand and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time while danglars had merely sipped his				1550.62539993672
d artagnan himself was moved by them				137.5947253500601
i was free at newcastle and had there concluded a treaty with both houses				3782.044227038082
come who is my father i came to tell you ah cried benedetto his eyes sparkling with joy				1824.4592580825254
you will retract this assertion will you not beauchamp said albert with increased though stifled anger				1581.5179071963767
but then he may have stopped at saint germain i don t think so we appointed to meet at la chevrette i was there this very day and had the pretty madeleine no news asked aramis smiling				881.7512110939723
special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the project gutenberg™ concept and trademark				1629.8839194978611
well said he friend what matters the regiment of guards to us and art thou not mad to make such a disturbance				8801.377621148788
there is half past ten striking albert confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued beauchamp				696.663033869553
what is it you want said the inspector				2561.0562469095066
athos listened to him without a frown and when he had finished said trifles only trifles that was his favorite word				611.5306522876617
some wine said athos on perceiving the host				1204.251660737069
it contained my fortune bills upon spain asked the disturbed host				943.767853977232
i ruined				10726.276681320884
she was stone dead				477.4809506934542
héloïse de villefort				342.5392342738022
the coadjutor looked at the queen who replied by a sign in the affirmative				2289.650709413953
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain				794.9842596024034
i can not make you share the fate i have planned for myself				765.5893893905513
you morcerf replied the secretary resting on the stairs				2651.5464921036883
these francs are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future you say this my dear boy but do you think we ought to accept these francs said mercédès coloring				70136.8158078706
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am				1430.0105861943566
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives passed whole days and nights in praying crying and groaning				14388.443131495593
as on the evening before the soldier stopped his march to listen to her				225.6569406779636
now if you will come on board m morrel said dantès observing the owner s impatience here is your supercargo m danglars coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular				17698.796242459775
some days before the return of the emperor fernand was drafted				39285.5236054188
as to the horse we can easily find some excuse for its disappearance				6105.152878376444
how did your father receive him albert				748.8022727340772
he had been seen falling from his horse and had not been seen to rise every one therefore believed him to be dead especially those to whom his death would give promotion				18110.046290235758
at eleven o clock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved court and the rue du faubourg saint honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a duchess				2377.316042283636
belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward				80141.85230718904
but don t think yourselves in a better position than you are				852.118402083381
you are no longer in my service monsieur bertuccio oh your excellency your excellency cried the steward struck with terror at this threat if that is the only reason i can not remain in your service i will tell all for if i quit you it will only be to go to the scaffold that is different replied monte cristo but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all no monsieur i swear to you by my hopes of salvation i will tell you all for the abbé busoni himself only knew a part of my secret but i pray you go away from that plane tree				5151.237736371346
i do not hold life dear enough to be afraid of death yes i know you are a man of a stout heart monsieur said the cardinal with a voice almost affectionate i can therefore tell you beforehand you shall be tried and even condemned another might reply to your eminence that he had his pardon in his pocket				1269.555840216915
at a league from beauvais where the road was confined between two high banks they fell in with eight or ten men who taking advantage of the road being unpaved in this spot appeared to be employed in digging holes and filling up the ruts with mud				63807.09140134735
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape but if you deliver me up to your masters i have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death grimaud hesitated				4568.041464633897
the cardinal has a weakness for these men which i can not comprehend indeed yes well then tell him this rochefort				1040.1331129887246
a few seconds afterward d artagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which ill concealed the sheath of a long sword				1152.6467879679635
he was a man between sixty six and sixty eight years of age little rather stout with gray hair and light eyes				403.06653146069755
in the bedroom in which this passage ended bernouin encountered madame de beauvais like himself intrusted with the secret of these subterranean love affairs and madame de beauvais undertook to prepare anne of austria who was in her oratory with the young king louis xiv to receive the cardinal				300.1612871190349
what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go why i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily bravo porthos				222.49101584463153
a nightly patrol				4186.30940219691
come with us to marseilles come along i will not what do you mean				5054.471055817507
so we followed him through the lowest streets in the city and in half an hour s time he stopped before a little isolated house				403.9831992233568
no but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your acquaintance in your own country for instance my dear little love				1561.783650358927
at nine o clock then be ready here at the hôtel i will come and take you planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master renounce his project heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom the third horse				917.5260965624307
suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air and dantès knew that the mistral was blowing				43708.25408700748
you think then said he that i am taken to the château d if to be imprisoned there it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard without any inquiry without any formality all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made and so in spite of m de villefort s promises i do not know what m de villefort promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the château d if				2576.691262103391
there is now a truce and a conference				9623.586341708477
have you then madame no compassion for your servants who for twenty years have vegetated in obscurity without betraying in a single sigh the solemn and sacred secrets they have had the honor to share with you				187.81535532917485
the terrified servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass				1960.198475546695
doctor do you hear them call for help yes yes let us hasten up it was in valentine s room but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening				62275.82421532187
how would you like to have it				77.72567603491407
would not m noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte cristo				471.7574864062482
what is the matter then he asked				893.5222718678848
haydée chapter				257.3772304401888
after mass the young monarch drove to the parliament house where upon the throne he hastily confirmed not only such edicts as he had already passed but issued new ones each one according to cardinal de retz more ruinous than the others a proceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief president molé whilst president blancmesnil and councillor broussel raised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes				12537.920199000975
the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière a street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailor but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès				759.232463319938
you love my mistress then very dearly monsieur chevalier said she				59.42601275430792
one of the forty methods of escape of the duc de beaufort				2540.265785365283
paris has been sufficiently punished enough blood has flowed enough misery has humbled a town deprived of its king and of justice				2228.469276554996
you are madame bonacieux the young woman drew back filled with surprise and terror				983.0934236683171
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape				2033.3136962848612
they were in the marvellous dining room before described where the statues had baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers				2266.5910849838683
this began to be annoying				53267.6400458032
surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a death why he was not altogether forsaken continued caderousse for mercédès the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernand the very person added caderousse with a bitter smile that you named just now as being one of dantès faithful and attached friends and was he not so asked the abbé				1083.3552758912372
i think this is about your position is it not confound it yes replied danglars				175.57913740218135
you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young man you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one				884.6334833659691
i won t have him killed i won t				12025.9273838442
the next two days passed in much the same way				733.2862081766459
for the present i will confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the baroness danglars excuse my impatience my dear count but a client like you is almost like a member of the family monte cristo bowed in sign that he accepted the proffered honor danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery				65207.95079447718
how can you reconcile that with his conduct this morning all owing to your influence replied monte cristo smiling				607.6857897265863
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour				1593.269923914096
he then saw that he must make another struggle against the grief of his friend and taking the hands of emmanuel and julie which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a father my kind friends leave me alone with maximilian julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic which monte cristo had forgotten				2844.077013315895
chapter xli				21212.321483860447
and yet as he journeyed along a profound sadness weighed upon his heart				429.81073277120566
at the end of his speech the king looked tenderly around upon the people				1151.58320532107
decidedly man is an ungrateful and egotistical animal				82286.4468118191
a man				228.13212686590475
my name is mordaunt replied the young man bowing				2803.5614649650443
you will not accept my gold i will keep it for myself				768.4370408880997
it is true also that as i did not then know his eminence if i had been able to dispense with the visit i should have been enchanted he ill treated you then he threatened you he gave me his hand and called me his friend				734.5082314250394
franz remained with m de villefort at the gate of the cemetery morrel made an excuse to wait he saw franz and m de villefort get into the same mourning coach and thought this meeting forboded evil				6796.3729788702985
chapter lxxxiv				35303.48304765183
this somnambulism of drunkenness had something frightful in it				95.99386898088979
if we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource you are right valentine but how shall i ascertain from the notary m deschamps i know him and for myself i will write to you depend on me				99.5279110587104
once with the army you may be killed at your good pleasure but until that time i warn you that in my capacity of general of the army i shall order a retreat and turn my back on the first red coat we come across de guiche and raoul glanced at each other smiling				931.1652403751416
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy				1304.364790663175
then take pistols with thee and a hunting knife are we then going to travel my lord asked mousqueton rather uneasy				2393.707361738844
then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms slowly a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword				1160.5603966147244
pardon me for interrupting you but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me possibly monsieur				1458.8200813266099
i shall faint again monte cristo approached and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial				43403.40738359562
baron send for the minister of war				2187.9119383818947

olivain he exclaimed what do i see below there a second scream more piercing than the first now sounded				9606.769028153041
arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning tone to her husband gaspard consider well what you are about to do i have both reflected and decided answered he				300.4634392915571
you are speaking you scoundrel said athos rising upon his elbow and transfixing grimaud with his flaming look				1016.6796311101564
the cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for albert				1034.0312566793018
it is he who in an encounter with your eminence s guards decided the victory in favor of the king s musketeers it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de wardes your emissary and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail it is he who knowing it was i who had madame bonacieux carried off has sworn my death ah ah said the cardinal i know of whom you speak i mean that miserable d artagnan he is a bold fellow said the cardinal				254.49104090227505
your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and see what they want monsieur d artagnan i will answer for everything nothing is so catching as confidence				5133.812795510296
father said mercédès stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit i pray you on my right hand on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart				412.3865807286829
well said the latter a young woman of about twenty six or twenty eight years of age and a man of from thirty five to forty have indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your eminence but the woman left last night and the man this morning it was they cried the cardinal looking at the clock and now it is too late to have them pursued				34048.0743093873
the young officer however remained mute and motionless his look alone had spoken				4301.365350518641
still further his confidence in the worthy picard at one time so great diminished day by day				451.6527392453105
his hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings while with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples				38618.33449132938
between the court and the garden built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the count and countess of morcerf				1602.5373721447675
penelon replied julie go and inform m emmanuel of this gentleman s visit and maximilian will conduct him to the salon then turning to monte cristo i hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes continued she and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of trees and escaped to the house by a lateral alley				17644.647379855604
how misfortune humbles a man i promise you it shall be done answered de comminges				4007.5701907196844
grimaud rose				3956.086202359105
it is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by valentine during the minute and a half madame de villefort remained in the room				201.90714678976929
i have only one thing to say to you				150.267613316051
i am not your uncle i know you not my uncle replied mordaunt with his harsh and bantering tone you are mistaken you will not have me turned out this time as you did in london you dare not				623.9867244168815
have i not told you so gentlemen				1765.9149445306607
d artagnan took upon himself that more than difficult task				7727.704213621037
no but i know a little about wounds and mine i know is mortal				7418.73021321984
that was the sloop				4675.031717521214
well asked aramis				21.1083116834061
in such cases extreme preoccupation is only to be combated by extreme carelessness				7981.589412849708
i said all that a man in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless next day next day sir you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said nothing though you were present when dantès was arrested yes sir i was there and very anxious to speak but danglars restrained me				91.77614780798937
and all present even including cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man				238.81994866705418
four other noblemen awaited me				99.05081783874125
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack				2061.3942390087254
he received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton nightcap in the other				997.9941490662934
ay but said aramis that young fellow is decidedly a spy which is the young man asked de winter turning around				2594.609422563054
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold				2167.5568858342913
but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she				221.81708139762137

a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it				79.46473052384711
allowing his head to sink upon his two hands he pretended to sleep				1460.6367787861586
in the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen walking				28640.00772342111
in that case your mother would hold me in aversion and i do not at all wish that on the contrary i desire to stand high in her esteem indeed count said morcerf i thank you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose				50505.61041507907
which asked he the viscount or the count the count oh exclaimed haydée is it not yet over i know not if it is finished my beloved child said monte cristo taking the young girl s hands but i do know you have nothing more to fear but it is the wretched that man can not injure me haydée said monte cristo it was his son alone that there was cause to fear and what i have suffered said the young girl you shall never know my lord monte cristo smiled				546.4623249038975
presently presently cried the latter when you haven t your cloak on at one o clock then behind the luxembourg very well at one o clock then replied d artagnan turning the angle of the street				1549.7184266303789
d artagnan will give each of us his instructions				3816.5485939487226

this son is named andrea cavalcanti				2754.2720309486735
one moment longer and all would disappear				5491.612311237063
are you satisfied sir there is one thing the queen has not signed her assent to the treaty of what use to day				462.65404877450567
richelieu still continued thinking rolling and unrolling the paper in his hands				566.1826778780023
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him				82.9712947328329
and you can not deny it added villefort extending his hand toward her as though to seize her in the name of justice				2233.637453396927
he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master				1385.979419269147
but you come from england				943.3768644979549
i endured the rain during the day and the cold during the night tolerably well but the third morning my horse died of cold				2061.883805920596
well said he on perceiving d artagnan				36.77796650545527
la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted				3482.8502323755556
it is the truth however				80628.72728314322
oh you do not mean that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion baptistin entered and remained standing at the door				344.898042423492
at length one evening as the jailer was visiting him for the last time that night dantès with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones				5429.921450033035
comminges turned and saw dame nanette her eyes flashing with anger and a broom in her hand				290.7363047220201
buckingham at once remembered the circumstance and suspecting that something was going on in france of which it was necessary he should be informed he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was and recognizing from afar the uniform of the guards he put his horse into a gallop and rode straight up to d artagnan				195.19698491991082
he may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh				58336.08504085452
but porthos was not a man to abandon an old servant and when mousqueton rose above the water blind as a new born puppy he found he was supported by the large hand of porthos and that he was thus enabled without having occasion even to move to advance toward the cable with the dignity of a very triton				52624.41423853157
i am all that is left to her belonging to my poor renée whom you have so soon forgotten sir ah madame said villefort you forget that i was obliged to give a mother to my child a stepmother is never a mother sir				351.65292209696645
well then we will go into paris				420.929034898109
those must have been ten weary years dantès took some louis from his pocket and gave them to the man who had twice unconsciously pitied him				83.75453351401391
one was the notary s the other that of franz and his friends				604.3968819529167

i see you are spoiled dear friend you are corpulent your arm has no longer that movement of which the late cardinal s guards have so many proofs ah				356.3266322309982
when he is tired he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough of it but the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with d artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter				78960.79129759992
in the court are orange trees in pots turf and clumps of flowers and no steel traps no the stables are on either side of the gate which you see there and andrea continued his plan				2453.34395493451

george villiers duke of buckingham mme				176.9843221827066
d avrigny returned about eight o clock in the morning he met villefort on his way to noirtier s room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept				2073.82854815938
here he said take this pocket book do you give it to me yes but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison				1425.330321921033
you will see danglars that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us nonsense				3860.0456764045707
well where is he sir asked raoul in a soft and coaxing voice				627.4734831601444
tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other abbés and what was the end of the affair we met in the place royale egad				2163.1820635307918

thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that albert required				20184.863186998264
as they were going down d artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their leader				49757.885876826374
this point of union was noirtier and it was he who had just sent for morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of barrois				2757.737484854265
the three young people were talking together				652.3033783967047
do not speak so loud young man don t speak so loud				59845.02757605344

we should only be three one of whom is wounded with the addition of a boy resumed athos and yet it will not be the less said we were four men yes but to yield said porthos				149.86274601433814
bazin followed him upon a roan holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse this was d artagnan s mount				14669.235648168726
d artagnan looked and was seized with pleasure				1336.2803666779698
as to d artagnan he sprang toward jussac himself				349.985942752398
fernand cried he of my hundred names i need only tell you one to overwhelm you				172.75387031160952
oh said morrel i know not indeed if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count morrel hesitated				4520.64287860603
the good captain leclere is dead father and it is probable that with the aid of m morrel i shall have his place				891.4816258010835

i do not jest said athos				12.112068780814317
and so dantès after the hundred days and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of earth and heaven				870.5801198457659
they will kill him you may be sure of it i don t maintain the contrary said d artagnan				13.686331297140441
the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champ de mars and satory				44578.7815653024
the little apartment was charming for its taste and neatness but in spite of himself his eyes were directed to that door which kitty said led to milady s chamber				852.4126297919164
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched				10681.127446516513

the suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of d artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket but what probability was there that mme				168.5151411560137
the piercing eye of monte cristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a shadow glide between the yew trees monte cristo recognized him whom he sought				5287.3599754544175
the apparent reason at least said madame de villefort				238.30747789000188
he has slain his uncle he murmured				2760.758359161961
he walked down the rue richelieu meditating how he should carry off the queen in her turn for to take her in a carriage bearing the arms of france was not to be thought of when he perceived an equipage standing at the door of the hotel belonging to madame de guemenee				69523.07998224674
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man				217.71654615227354
as for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly appearance of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at sight of the goat had turned to appetite				3974.017419211663

i adore rome and i have always had a great taste for archæology come two or three more such adventures and i do not despair of seeing you a member of the academy doubtless albert was about to discuss seriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that dinner was ready				741.4846788967174
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron d épinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel				6368.10998352476
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated				3387.4425491075576
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him				82.05217361506274
he opened his eyes				373.33897311836427
you need as much as we do that interior condition of repose which thanks to the energy of our government we are about to attain				62253.49725744183
d artagnan continued before god and before men i accuse this woman of having attempted to poison me in wine which she sent me from villeroy with a forged letter as if that wine came from my friends				494.02690966406186

at the same time continued d artagnan notwithstanding your forty thousand francs a year and perhaps even for the very reason that you have forty thousand francs a year it seems to me that a little coronet would do well on your carriage hey yes indeed said porthos				171.27696706297286

madame de saint méran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint méran at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentine or still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to livres per annum and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp				601.5251952702304

you say then he continued that the count de rochefort spoke of me to the cardinal yes and the queen too the queen do you say to inspire us with confidence she has even placed in mazarin s hands that famous diamond you remember all about it that i once sold to monsieur des essarts and of which i don t know how she has regained possession but it seems to me said porthos that she would have done much better if she had given it back to you so i think replied d artagnan but kings and queens are strange beings and have odd fancies nevertheless since they are the ones who have riches and honors we are devoted to them yes we are devoted to them repeated porthos and you to whom are you devoted now to the king the queen and to the cardinal moreover i have answered for your devotion also and you say that you have made certain conditions on my behalf magnificent my dear fellow magnificent				8401.176969678761
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired				6423.137910240551
and why presently				20328.261313255924
well i must confess it does replied d artagnan				5.888364622098147
it is enough replied the prince				839.2868376068617
scarcely had i covered it with earth when the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me i saw a shadow rise and at the same time a flash of light				1431.9928265337644
and there are no doors by which you can escape this time but those of hell oh				893.0762935460618
there s a providence that watches over the deserving				57381.51944508357
all villefort s influence barely enabled him to stifle the secret dantès had so nearly divulged				67156.58984836057
you foolish fellow said athos laughing				1093.8881561580297
is the count shooting in the gallery said morcerf				765.581358080364
these were all who were left of the little troop				21601.341790423812
who employed you to assassinate me a woman whom i don t know but who is called milady but if you don t know this woman how do you know her name my comrade knows her and called her so				448.00890027704185
you know the rest				1402.6472713350738
he recalled his arrival on the island his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish				7756.018809608581
shall further inquiries be made				1813.297894981149
and yet they were the same murmured monte cristo only now it is broad daylight instead of night it is the sun which brightens the place and makes it appear so cheerful he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint laurent and advanced to the consigne it was the point where he had embarked				43745.95216399675
dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration				1612.1807987302566
with what view with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of buckingham d artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation				65289.96498818214
the nails too were turning blue				20292.002085081214
terror was so strongly painted on his face covered with a cold sweat that d artagnan took pity on him and casting upon him a look of contempt stop said he i will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you				176.27070538786526
i did not come to rome to see said danglars aloud then he added softly with an avaricious smile i came to touch and he rapped his pocket book in which he had just placed a letter				695.2115279399898
i am a priest resumed aramis				192.06666796477774
you are the child of my captivity				2252.4735790364507
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears				2831.483183194487
d artagnan charged with a party of musketeers up the rue du coq and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke dispersing near the place saint germain l auxerrois and taking the direction of the quays				80207.30243614374
i merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years that we have ceased to be husband and wife and see whether it has not always been consistent				85772.04640551578
respect to fallen majesty				4081.798208644394
retire within bertuccio and tranquillize your mind				459.52012712746864
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections				6210.326405020812
woe to you m de villefort if you do not strike first this is what i would say had she only killed two persons but she has seen three deaths has contemplated three murdered persons has knelt by three corpses				22095.70538552747
she had been standing at the door to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young can not resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching				54231.13740323595
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him				80.34854604383573
here is a letter i have just received on the subject shall it be read or shall it be passed over				1825.2284736441713
mon dieu cried danglars we are not returning to rome then it is not justice which is pursuing me				119.35532506701377
read the address monsieur el comte de wardes the remembrance of the scene at st germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon				1628.2611795750572
prison had made edmond prudent and he was desirous of running no risk whatever				3712.5307668164087
the queen appeared cheerful and happy which seemed to astonish the persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost always sad and full of care				1800.009631344165
ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man				233.54591067340328
no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but one of those dreams that forerun death				727.1309315627357
at the same instant the firing began on the other side and the balls penetrated the boards all round us				560.7042551358728
it s little enough but so it is no it can not be are you my friend caderousse yes in life or death well i will tell you a secret what is it but remember ah				322.182255828017
at length the shutter closed				2010.2976879948217
bertuccio sat down upon the chair andrea threw himself upon the bed the keeper retired				823.3601310036055
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent				5694.80854345025
at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop				3233.6799649911995
father he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live yes i do so bid you answered morrel it is your duty				2716.1209240364005
ah forgive me said valentine perceiving the effect which her words were producing on maximilian i have done wrong for i have given utterance to thoughts concerning that man which i did not even know existed in my heart				410.5066623113565
how lofty how magnificent monsieur athos was that day when he said to his adversary you have insisted on knowing my name sir so much the worse for you since i shall be obliged to kill you i was near him those were his exact words when he stabbed his foe as he said he would and his adversary fell without saying oh tis a noble gentleman monsieur athos yes true as gospel said d artagnan but one single fault has swallowed up all these fine qualities i remember well said planchet he was fond of drinking in truth he drank but not as other men drink				10210.331670591346
they mounted again at once whilst looks of admiration passed between them				146.06555373211646
the party was to take place at st germain i believe and they had appointed to meet at the carmes deschaux when they were disturbed by de jussac cahusac bicarat and two other guardsmen who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts ah ah				357.4644618238338
alas alas alas all the world is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his words				715.7035388685297
planchet who was still a little concerned for his safety after his recent escapade declared that he would follow d artagnan even to the end of the world either by the road to the right or by that to the left only he begged his former master to set out in the evening for greater security to himself				360.43613937700127
thanks my dear friend said madame danglars trying to smile it is over now and i am much better chapter				298.4432472253308
when he had perused the documents an indefinable expression of pleasure lighted up his countenance and looking at the major with a most peculiar smile he said in very excellent tuscan then there is no longer any such thing in italy as being condemned to the galleys the major drew himself up to his full height				8694.608606705999
and yet at the very door the musketeer began to entertain some doubts				18966.89776364558
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them				129.74469538373506
good by				6046.641207147346
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and d avrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child d avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish				1686.530105039367
no i would join the escort athos s eyes shone with joy				1941.56657424149
my friend said he one never has too much money				951.8123651376635
a dreadful silence followed the reading of this document the count could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on haydée seemed one of fire and blood				1183.3324638291201
chapter viii				8813.49799272863
men fell around him as they had fallen at rocroy or at lerida				45393.64358618156
athos then arose from his chair girded on his sword enveloped himself in his cloak and left the hôtel				1621.8459074278946
scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars dear hermine i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo we were talking about yesterday but whom i little expected to see today				3637.492863836728
the only question was had she ten or twelve				7225.02089243593
athos made a sign to the vicomte de bragelonne to remain where he was				1076.8478591542107
remember this is no affair of mine said the trembling voice of la carconte as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the scene that was enacting below				3654.792062680827
is it not a curious affair so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character not at all we have received with the information all the requisite proofs and we are quite sure m de morcerf will not raise his voice against us besides it is rendering a service to one s country to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed on them beauchamp was thunderstruck				17857.40470458921
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort s for the purpose of returning the procureur s visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion				4501.863513291221
i warn you however his services will cost you something				3230.6252860614104
yes yes said felton i understand how he would act				2341.1389268591374
you always say trifles my dear athos said d artagnan and that comes very ill from you who have never loved the drink deadened eye of athos flashed out but only for a moment it became as dull and vacant as before				1063.631499547844
my god yes gave that is the word said porthos for the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis and the stingy fellow would only give me eighty without the saddle said aramis				174.87218706328855
have you seen him lately he sent for me to day really				3009.249960410788
after all continued d artagnan there was certainly one with aramis				427.7646862911998
bertuccio remained standing before him				70.8488398745494
bonacieux saw that he hesitated				4541.215270367913
the third of my friends although my rival was much attached to me his name was fernand that of my betrothed was stay stay continued the abbé i have forgotten what he called her mercédès said caderousse eagerly				3620.171971723404
the lackeys had been ordered to saddle eight horses and to wait keeping together and without dismounting at the corner of a street about twenty steps from the house where the king was lodged				50693.807204696306
aramis and his thesis d artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurator s wife				1110.6805496928043
oh yes said the count you are looking for the sailors yes i paid them nothing and yet they are gone never mind that maximilian said monte cristo smiling				854.298664669154
the noble carriage of this gentleman for whom he believed himself to be engaged had won planchet that was the name of the picard				55141.18252026083
covered with flames assunta rushed wildly to the door but it was fastened she flew to the windows but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was assunta calling for help				5105.280240494117
for all evils there are two remedies time and silence				883.1886446262349
what does the animal say asked the duke				705.9305819000207
well inquired franz after the countess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box what do you think of our opposite neighbor why that he is no other than lord ruthven himself in a living form this fresh allusion to drew a smile to franz s countenance although he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him				73.41205936777538
cambalet his niece while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke all things which appeared to d artagnan monstrous impossibilities				36249.03327452259
and another i carry all my effects with me				128.32524332519208
afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage				40717.84976624039
it gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but i have said nothing either to the one or to the other				930.9419280207645
you will see replied monte cristo that they will be as different as possible in the hands of ali				2821.5499948411048
no and you porthos no and you athos no if it was not you it was your purveyor said d artagnan				18.142724989261794
the guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the death of his four companions				901.4414853564489
danglars meditated an escape but the walls were solid rock a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed				2395.3903894341715
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison				1466.0724932728324
having bowed to the two ladies he extended his hand to debray				1035.3762245212743
little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians i should not have thought this the place for such a demand still if people will shut themselves up said albert and can not be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen i am not difficult of access sir for yesterday if my memory does not deceive me you were at my house yesterday i was at your house sir said the young man because then i knew not who you were in pronouncing these words albert had raised his voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the lobby				48733.62893317253
come said the count smiling with his own peculiar smile not so bad for a man who is to be shot at seven o clock tomorrow morning vampa looked at albert with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a proof of courage				646.338892085952
but where is your master he is following me the servitor opened the gate and walked before planchet who made a sign to d artagnan				167.79718271205627
and what does it amount to after all				601.2880339849006
upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from tours we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed or rather went before bazin he ran without stopping from the rue férou to the rue de vaugirard				7918.056429540333
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for heretics in truth said athos aramis is right				1308.779521445415
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host				1123.9652895614443
drive to the palace said comminges to the coachman who was by then more dead than alive				4507.340814938042
when he compared the public crimes of this minister startling crimes european crimes if so we may say with the private and unknown crimes with which milady had charged him felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life				563.4479578702857
morrel was there he had come twenty minutes before the time appointed				12372.2587950886
do you not see that the wind has blown off my hat aramis rushed after the fugitive hat				2125.9731309309996
pardieu mute as a carp well i think andrea stopped and looked around				2677.8201601141645
i deserted the church for the world for you know that i forced myself when i became a musketeer i				835.1246742380782
it was then richelieu s object not only to get rid of an enemy of france but to avenge himself on a rival but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand as his weapon for combat the forces of a kingdom				9236.211147355694
i hoped that the active and laborious life of a smuggler with the severe discipline on board would have a salutary effect on his character which was now well nigh if not quite corrupt				21110.789899644322
really that demoiselle d aubigne is very charming so the invalid disappeared soon afterward and went into his sleeping room and one by one the lights in the salon of the rue des tournelles were extinguished				10780.670738542563
and lord de winter do you know anything about him i know that he is in high favor with charles i the fortunes of that monarch now are at low water				1876.3767411414517
in an instant all the strength of mind of this creature though drawn from the most vigorous sources abandoned her she sank into a large easy chair with her arms crossed her head lowered and expecting every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her				243.7633068274528
moreover in defending ourselves we shall cover ourselves with glory				8461.756648851313
fly friends fly he added whirling his sword around him				85.4552053681496
you said let us die here i recall to you that word oh said porthos death is nothing it isn t death that can disquiet us since we don t know what it is				1031.0446487204167
on arriving at the hotel de bouillon they came across a little troop of three cavaliers who seemed to know every possible password for they walked without either guide or escort and on arriving at the barricades had nothing to do but to speak to those who guarded them who instantly let them pass with evident deference due probably to their high birth				4954.199288803487
i do not love her but i will avenge myself for her contempt oh yes i know what sort of vengeance				1502.7069923942295
this morning he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony at this moment a fresh visitor entered and according to custom franz gave up his seat to him				80.79787028330651
well eagerly demanded all his three friends				583.4423220528314
yes yes said la ramee the matter concerns you for you will have the honor to serve us and besides however good an appetite we may have and however great our thirst there will be something left on the plates and in the bottles and that something will be yours grimaud bowed in thanks				1558.181892725555
the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty five years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time				362.99918773533875
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the jew s again what				602.7770730546316
dr guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from witnessing an execution in italy				2302.4998826499223
now we are on the very road which all the vessels between dover and calais take tis impossible but that we should meet with a fisherman who will pick us up but should we not find any fisherman and should the wind shift to the north that said athos would be quite another thing and we should nevermore see land until we were upon the other side of the atlantic which implies that we may die of hunger said aramis				189.74386561436398
there is the wounded man said de guiche passing close to the augustine brother				1528.538745357118
here is a beautiful lawn let us go on straight forwards bertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow but obeyed however he continued to take the left hand				283.76086175665665
look well at that man it is he who raised your father s head on the point of a spear it is he who sold us it is he who forsook us				541.4317987092861
all at once she paused a livid flash darted from her eyes she ran to the table emptied into mme				204.4321644054499
this cavalier is my attendant would it not be safer and more certain if i should ask him his name and tell him yours demanded the host				983.3653510446024
mazarin again				451.8451009718623
but in a word what are you going to do asked she				179.78967936070697

he turned and saw julie				2900.2225742079863

the count went out first then albert				920.312009488194
they will treat you as a deserter i warn you i do not enter the church i re enter it				93.10533257515132
at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do they opened the door and the four men alighted franz again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his brow there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father s death which had hitherto been a mystery				3203.8798435789436
he lives at the bedford tavern greenhall street				1556.078397590064

she saw me also and in trying to jump from the end of a pile of wood on which she had mounted the poor child fell and was not able to rise again				470.05117323150654
and he touched his mule				65392.22244296181
i am giving them the slip said eugénie this woman to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty we will soon alter our direction and the young girl jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the step				2149.513889892298
but you my dear d artagnan what has happened to you so that this strain of the knee continued d artagnan my dear porthos keeps you in bed my god that s all				569.4159394736113
but what did m danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur oh he laughed and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself half malicious half ferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first time i observed the agitation of my grandfather and i must tell you maximilian that i am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame				8265.125429782625
it is you bernouin she said				288.0332497289151

at sight of this man d artagnan started and half drawing his sword sprang toward the door				343.6586003044333
i won t hold my tongue replied caderousse i say i want to know why they should put dantès in prison i like dantès dantès your health and he swallowed another glass of wine				1088.8386983961313
what exclaimed the queen when the last of them had quitted the apartment you would yield to these limbs of the law these advocates to promote your majesty s welfare madame replied mazarin fixing his penetrating eyes on the queen there is no sacrifice that i would not make anne dropped her head and fell into one of those reveries so habitual with her				222.68344377666185

i am hungry that is all pardieu if that is all i am hungry too but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses ah exclaimed aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as athos do you remember when we were at parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said porthos smacking his lips				707.2870912528779

let us alight raoul said athos				12.374526194027771
the crowd opened and closed again undulating like a stormy sea and the king imagined that he saw shining in the midst of this living wave the bright eyes of athos				317.82997533783384
the house at auteuil monte cristo noticed as they descended the staircase that bertuccio signed himself in the corsican manner that is had formed the sign of the cross in the air with his thumb and as he seated himself in the carriage muttered a short prayer				4505.376812381009

porthos was in bed and was playing a game at lansquenet with mousqueton to keep his hand in while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of a large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the smell				52596.46775211062
amid all this d artagnan remarked also that not one countenance responded to the gallantries of porthos				337.4557861845693
what could she have done to you				138.63640642522114
the crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be tumultuous				67968.43123108547
since lord de winter left him i am distracted sirs				13408.971482212337

yes monsieur i know only him well but then continued athos speaking half to himself if i kill you i shall have the air of a boy slayer not too much so replied d artagnan with a bow that was not deficient in dignity since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient very inconvenient upon my word and you hurt me devilishly i can tell you				174.66109895287877
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo				363.57517346382036

the musketeers few in number not being able in the midst of this crowd to make their horses wheel around began to give way				671.4102429768348
the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the house but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of discovery				21050.979652090868
monte cristo knew everything as he had bought the daughter of ali pasha and knowing everything he had advised danglars to write to yanina				6923.727373038404
and the duke furious against the cardinal				309.5853383123433
come speak monsieur de cavois monsieur de cavois in person the captain of the cardinal s guards himself did he come to arrest me i have no doubt that he did monsieur for all his wheedling manner was he so sweet then indeed he was all honey monsieur indeed he came he said on the part of his eminence who wished you well and to beg you to follow him to the palais royal it was called the palais cardinal before richelieu gave it to the king				435.71888669612815
but bazin still the servant of a musketeer when once the blood mounted to his fat cheeks seized a broomstick and began belaboring blaisois saying you have insulted the church my friend you have insulted the church at this moment aramis aroused by this unusual disturbance cautiously opened the door of his room and blaisois looking reproachfully at the cerberus drew the letter from his pocket and presented it to aramis				280.9156288034371

but tell me what do you ask nothing for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for something the procurator s wife hung upon the arm of porthos and in the violence of her grief she cried out monsieur porthos i am ignorant of all such matters				3695.0252263689986
the road was long but the horses upon which d artagnan and planchet rode had been refreshed in the well supplied stables of the lord of bracieux the master and servant rode side by side conversing as they went for d artagnan had by degrees thrown off the master and planchet had entirely ceased to assume the manners of a servant				1369.4665340958743

yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain				3993.130312959036
porthos knocked with his hand				278.605549897055

the officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the carriage and this operation ended he took his place beside milady and shut the door				341.0230900279684
the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out francs in the course of an hour i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face				944.0586139909707

milady therefore continued coloring her narrations more and more				1350.8340521917871
thus m de tréville was praised to the highest note by these men who adored him and who ruffians as they were trembled before him like scholars before their master obedient to his least word and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash out the smallest insult				9727.243656438588
franz dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the night at the duke of bracciano s				1153.8241355847374
m de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face				937.6481098031747
then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table				694.2025037022688
the count of monte cristo acts dishonorably to m de morcerf and is justified by his son				763.397418713498
the same expression continued				3148.9815618518974
franz untied it and in the midst of the most profound silence read extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques held february franz stopped				1145.7903559495564

the notary looked at villefort				431.1815684877788
one of the two guardsmen was engaged that evening and another the next so the meeting was fixed for the day after that				734.0884127069994
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara				67716.62038731975
your eminence said comminges as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door				328.63512771922234
mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and disappeared				1242.3489699657691

all that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard				52526.390936182506
i shall be gone only a few moments villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace				2134.0191903102536
ah sir she muttered ah sir and this was all				711.8520821756341
pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of terror				966.4970123105992
by jove				8809.682854875093
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too				1493.6941780722327
i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so				518.8733726935467
maximilian uttered a cry of delight and springing forwards seized the hand extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss				2378.2310275679674
eugénie continued the baroness turning towards her daughter this is the count of monte cristo the count bowed while mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly				20510.257788845305
you will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan thank you sir thank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her				204.00778394700518
you are a brave fellow as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being used				3819.352226383303
i confess if the court would do justice to my claims and give the head of my house the title of prince and if my brother de turenne were reinstated in his command i would return to my estates and leave the court and parliament to settle things between themselves as they might you are perfectly right my lord you think so				541.3378312371356
have you then power against death				665.4852106295042
debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the minister and besides albert looked at his tablets it is the hour i told the count may at half past ten and though i do not much rely upon his promise i wish to be punctual				73694.64901441074
what can have happened then to bragelonne let him enter cried d artagnan let him come up but grimaud had already mounted the staircase and was waiting on the last step so springing into the room he motioned the host to leave it				96.52299821344079
he stopped at the door villefort gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his hands m				597.5377712288442
sir said monte cristo to him i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at stay said debray i recognize this hobbema ah indeed yes it was proposed for the museum which i believe does not contain one said monte cristo				253.5735877765724
must you know all absolutely and rather from your lips than another s muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more albert passed his hand over his forehead as if to try his strength as a man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends his sword				1089.528932219002
if the second copy is also defective you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem				6147.933149597394
i should be glad however to receive your excellency s commands concerning the dinner really my dear m bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so				382.0885870119362
two hours later thirty officiating ministers from the most populous and consequently the most disturbed parishes of paris had assembled there				979.3130051935191
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well the carriage again moved on				654.1504705870869
look at the comte de la fere a type of nobility a flower of chivalry				63435.28284853045
i must speak to him about it as to athos his face aflame his fists clinched his lips bitten till they bled he sat there foaming with rage at that endless parliamentary insult and that long enduring royal patience the inflexible arm and steadfast heart had given place to a trembling hand and a body shaken by excitement				4532.739074369241
an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my wife to have a little conversation with me it is so rarely i make such a request i am sure you can not grudge it to me debray muttered something bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the door like nathan in athalie				46450.139989066636
i think only that i have known you not a whole year				1810.1334544306906
ah monsieur said mousqueton then you have come here only to awaken our regrets i fear that is true said d artagnan in a low tone				928.4345687327825
after a short time the count saw bertuccio who until then had been occupied on the other side of the house glide into an adjoining room				200.20964521949094
what blows what blood he fainted				1435.1673905632413
as he descended the staircase morrel met penelon who was going up				1097.4554896646548
d artagnan came again on the morrow and was still better received than on the evening before				1156.6842414249718
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot				56933.77838730176
is she french no a venetian and her name is countess g ah i know her by name exclaimed albert she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty				5637.411743137743
go on signor pastrini continued franz smiling at his friend s susceptibility				24098.359897332033
i drew near and found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag				35988.48838105452
the two assistants carried andrea up to the scaffold the people all took part against andrea and twenty thousand voices cried put him to death				669.3784288130191
in that case gentlemen have the kindness to retire into the corners so as to give us ample room				179.4924408504088
let us break the carriage cried the people				1049.580920591373
he was a man of execution this worthy porthos				306.8686867688083
then you can let me have some money can you not whatever you say my dear count i am at your orders why replied monte cristo since we mutually understand each other for such i presume is the case danglars bowed assentingly				100950.98344551715
i have no hope of penetrating sword in hand to paris i know that well				603.4759242717935
they were playing together as usual when seven o clock sounded the patrol was heard passing to double the posts				10797.792318185391
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event poor girl so young so rich so beautiful				6338.572322608637
from a distance resounded deadened however by good shutters the songs of the tipplers enjoying themselves in the cabarets scattered along the plain				6757.801100178728
the air they breathed was heavy damp and cold				2018.3062766925098
but when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found themselves in the open plain d artagnan who was completely ignorant of what was going forward thought it was time to demand an explanation				1640.33159778771
during this short time valentine must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the woman disturbed stopped and leaned over the bed in order the better to ascertain whether valentine slept it was madame de villefort				574.1556375167985
why it is indeed a true royal jewel which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a denier				69625.3934566038
dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them				129.06107719920044
i wish to consult you on this passage molli fugiens anhelitu you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf				25502.945259604654
mine also are from him indeed sir i recognize you you are captain mordaunt mordaunt was startled				42730.58142508246
know that monsieur de bracieux is rich enough to drink a tun of port wine even if obliged to pay a pistole for every drop his manner became more and more lofty every instant then he arose and after finishing off the beer at one draught he advanced majestically to the door of the compartment where the wine was				1056.125486826953
speak monsieur speak at once said mazarin what is the matter the matter is my lord that the duc de beaufort has contrived to escape from the chateau of vincennes mazarin uttered a cry and became paler than the man who had brought the news				2459.296319297293
two hours afterward dantès sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht				3523.626045252618
teresa was sixteen and vampa seventeen				49210.74830416275
well then how is it that your eminence complained just now of want of information you think resumed mazarin that rochefort he was cardinal richelieu s creature my lord				634.929885307837
yes sir and as he said it was an ancient name				993.4863490693742
and since i do not give it said the musketeer				1942.5046474166907
i not only promise but swear it said monte cristo extending his hand				295.9781643982661
d artagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey				1595.092799169895
this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator who had just designated him by the name of aramis				418.764093736806
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled				20663.88813929458
he commanded with it it was the medium through which his thanks were conveyed				47022.8305572121
no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor i am a royalist replied the general i have taken the oath of allegiance to louis xviii and i will adhere to it these words were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness				73530.79630011551
there said d artagnan what did i tell you				95.60111457844765
well those studs continued mme				104.61716665591919
mute with horror the three friends had remained open mouthed their eyes dilated their arms extended like statues and motionless as they were the beating of their hearts was audible				10841.831943754194
the king smiled patted it with his hand and jumped lightly into the saddle				2741.2862348310905
he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed				1751.7288905630407
edmond my friend do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart				418.90309566858656
when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching				2281.262600147153
it neither increased nor decreased my income albert felt the blood mounting to his brow there was no doubt upon the subject				1890.4261737870518
the park is twenty acres twenty comprising kitchen gardens and a common				46390.066068798835
but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty				4073.2393483078245
the favorite of two kings immensely rich all powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice george villiers duke of buckingham had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive in the course of centuries to astonish posterity				83908.68135439848
two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling				539.304497650713
you are certainly treating your cousin very handsomely the poor fowl was thin and covered with one of those thick bristly skins through which the teeth can not penetrate with all their efforts				5598.717834907178
the queen pressed her brother and the emperor of austria to appear to be wounded as they really were by the policy of richelieu the eternal object of which was the abasement of the house of austria to declare war against france and as a condition of peace to insist upon the dismissal of the cardinal but as to love there was not a single word about it in all the letter				715.8854610498616
i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god last of all i speak to you				124.32390309486784
it happens well that we are going there this evening said athos to the vicomte we will pay our compliments to that poor man what then is this monsieur scarron who thus puts all paris in commotion				18096.23469080003
i too sir was almost dead when you arrived wait wait young man do not fatigue yourself with speaking				2904.047523526831
will our help come from you yes you are sure of it yes there was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer no one could at any rate doubt his will if they did his power				3735.50178742683
pardon me monseigneur for saying such things but they form my excuse				1981.4897361688595
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her				221.95568420372095
you would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald green sea you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning				49776.68074143913
out of the hundred and sixty three members designated there were only seventy three present for the rest fearful of taking part in such an act had remained away				644.2059878038368
i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor roof				8170.805012643173
the others withdrew				4415.614881141879
well then will you do as much for me in paris as franz did for you in rome with pleasure there was a cry of shut up from the audience				4622.84908695807
come this is no longer our home the words died away the steps were lost in the distance				2703.2144587937064
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day				437.9357709669772
come said d artagnan to raoul seeing that athos wished to be alone come let us take a turn in the fencing gallery that will amuse you and they both went into a low room where there were foils gloves masks breastplates and all the accessories for a fencing match				11327.034557130984
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces				5151.222998583048
at the hour agreed upon groslow came				1457.6074250008135
by the way said m de boville are you not going to the funeral of poor mademoiselle de villefort which i met on my road here no said the banker i have appeared rather ridiculous since that affair of benedetto so i remain in the background bah you are wrong				1324.280879793033
thus the soldiers of other companies than those which belonged to the red duke as aramis had called him often took part with the king s musketeers in these quarrels				50631.91458390957
the sea smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in another element while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermen s boats white and graceful as the sea gull or the merchant vessels bound for corsica or spain				9144.263614594936
thanks my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone a tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic englishman				1415.4553846788508
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the château d if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed				13561.0817763204
my friend said beauchamp in the most affectionate tone i should gladly make an apology but alas but what the paragraph was correct my friend what				593.6028194500951
answer me do not these crimes exist yes answered franz and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated ah duelling cried the count a pleasant manner upon my soul of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance				1505.5249425989487
then resting his foot on a small ledge he made a sign to show all was right				1394.162788086102
but be of good courage my lad in three days we shall be delivered from this creature and where i shall send her she can harm nobody you hear him cried milady with vehemence so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven and that felton might understand she was addressing him				67.73721791640803
this man might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have thought possible upon my word said dantès you make me shudder				5277.133766006078
mademoiselle paulet had already gone mademoiselle de scudery was going				2274.775554507916
between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass				1946.4285307654006
i should like to have seen the count take something in my house if only an ice				5352.461832446653
ah pardieu continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity monseigneur replied milady a fair exchange				26666.262802859863
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me				119.60047335380176
athos you have done wrong but my dear friend put yourself in my place replied the musketeer				1822.9061531500392
it is not natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond				1394.514505625067
how ghastly pale he is oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said franz				182.4258247756062
he took the arm of madame danglars and conducted her into the garden where they found danglars taking coffee between the cavalcanti				3070.033463991278
fresh sharpened by his victory full of hopes of future favor he was resolved not to recoil a step				2266.152324746508
the usher introduced him and retired without speaking a word				682.8216329320625
tell me what it says count will you allow me to send baptistin to inquire after someone you know i am at your service and still more my servants oh i can not live if she is not better shall i ring for baptistin no i will go and speak to him myself morrel went out called baptistin and whispered a few words to him				66.65093596474635

here s an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby				69096.01739710208
however the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite				14271.148865419718
you see i am calm and strong				5429.854131554184
he lost it the day before yesterday and olivain and the host took their way together toward the inn olivain according to the custom of serving men well pleased with their place relating to the tavern keeper all that he could say in favor of the young gentleman whilst raoul wrote on thus sir after a four hours march i stop to write to you for i miss you every moment and i am always on the point of turning my head as if to reply when you speak to me				110.3487917084529
oh woe to me yes you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest search search but what have i done to you exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality what have i done to you				185.458697619011

ten minutes later the escort stopped at ermenonville but the four friends went on with well sustained ardor guarding mazarin carefully				13126.91481717755
in this list there were three conditions which displeased mazarin and he offered the prince ten thousand crowns to renounce them ah ha ha laughed the three friends not a bad bargain and there was no fear of being taken at his word what did the prince do then the prince immediately sent fifty thousand francs to mazarin begging him never to write to him again and offered twenty thousand francs more on condition that he would never speak to him				74.92119048842602

it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the foot so perfectly formed it was none of these things that attracted the attention it was his pale complexion his waving black hair his calm and serene expression his dark and melancholy eye his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdain these were what fixed the attention of all upon him				79.53683329790911

what do you want screamed milady				156.47130801047265

the count dismissing his carriage followed him about a hundred paces behind				804.7481299942541

well said the cardinal eagerly rising with a promptitude which proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with which he had charged the count				295.5817042128099
but there as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the jolly miller without anyone host waiter or hostler coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse d artagnan spied though an open window on the ground floor a gentleman well made and of good carriage although of rather a stern countenance talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect				9842.036731055101

where are you going marechal asked the queen				327.67123852346845
thou alarmest me said athos who never used thee and thou but upon very particular occasions what has happened look you my friends cried d artagnan a horrible suspicion crosses my mind				445.5128087608421
oh the red duke				991.2263831936424
albert rubbed his eyes ordered his servant to introduce him into the small smoking room on the ground floor dressed himself quickly and went down				1367.9602102127758
count said emmanuel when they were at the end of the place royale put me down at my door that my wife may not have a single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said morrel i would invite the count to our house besides that he doubtless has some trembling heart to comfort				82272.00877597313
worn out at length he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late				3080.9442673864655
at the end of the dinner he entered in person				1365.953921163204
mousqueton was a norman whose pacific name of boniface his master had changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of mousqueton				2046.7074821916237
and i also said d artagnan i also				2115.2152301679275
i began to fear that he would not come				1261.2556031828876
no hermine replied debray you can not make me believe that on the contrary you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count s				1028.1960933546757
in the month of july				51018.85562544025
he let off his fire at but four paces				5258.59084713592
i was not aware that you were so intimate with her who told you we were intimate maximilian no one but you appeared to be so				514.4629450211409
however i swear i was not guilty i swear it by the queen looked around her for some sacred object by which she could swear and taking out of a cupboard hidden in the tapestry a small coffer of rosewood set in silver and laying it on the altar i swear she said by these sacred relics that buckingham was not my lover what relics are those by which you swear asked mazarin smiling				917.1639093425355
it was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate for maximilian had long awaited her coming				10889.23885139512
you know very well that the last was stopped on his way dashed on the rocks and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows they ascended five or six more steps and then dantès felt that they took him one by the head and the other by the heels and swung him to and fro				52667.893744800414
it was there a lodging was prepared for them				138.03876896489484
and now said athos it is not our plan to run anywhere and like madmen but we must map up our campaign				19228.266633601354
have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker				19192.303786031247
if bonaparte landed at naples the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach piombino if he land in tuscany he will be in an unfriendly territory if he land in france it must be with a handful of men and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population				64499.59690534904
to see him so self satisfied reconciles me with myself				739.69319890146
from behind the door a human figure appeared but the girl was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize morrel				718.8158803277837
then the shots were repeated without regularity but always aimed with the same accuracy				15714.066630947522
faria has dreamed this the cardinal spada buried no treasure here perhaps he never came here or if he did cæsar borgia the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as i have done raised the stone and descending before me has left me nothing he remained motionless and pensive his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his feet				951.2570031894812
what the devil shall we do now gentlemen cried athos				15.623477750711775
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky				5652.593186692039
and as i hear everywhere that at the court they are ill disposed to him i wish to warn him that he may be on his guard broussel heard the scream of the young oddity and enchanted with this excess of zeal came down to the first floor for he was in truth working in his room on the second				1317.0282151332485
did i ever tell you that my mother was lady of honor to marie de medici never				4116.826298459138
a key was inserted in the lock of the first door and the creaking of hinges was audible				10825.745169230318
felton said buckingham you will withdraw and place yourself at once under arrest you will hear me to the end my lord				695.8031803547761
my dear friend exclaimed athos how i should admire the resources of your mind did i not stop to adore those of your heart and he gave him his hand				275.503378496398
the stranger ascended a rough staircase and before a table illumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while the rest of the apartment was in partial darkness he perceived the abbé in a monk s dress with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned men of the middle ages				90792.35250456823
it is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good say not so quickly returned monte cristo say not so my friends angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to be				943.3944083096666
she seemed however by certain signs to recognize a door and approaching that door and now monsieur said she it is here i have business a thousand thanks for your honorable company which has saved me from all the dangers to which alone i was exposed				14518.881055028842
but sir once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an officer that i am detaining here and he glanced timidly at the count s blue coat				1695.9590737169299
london is far from paris very far and perhaps the commission with which you charge me is not without dangers what matters it if you avoid them hold madame bonacieux said the mercer hold				2578.9591412033747
lieutenant asked aramis				24.279767321864462
really i might even say that we have some reason to praise him impossible yes really it is owing to him that we are free owing to him yes he had us conducted into the orangery by monsieur bernouin his valet de chambre and from there we followed him to visit the comte de la fere				1928.2906749474016
he rose to return the salutation				11671.913080199345
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg				72556.34016048454
come aramis and we porthos said d artagnan will return carrying our shame to the cardinal and tell him cried a voice that i am not too old yet for a man of action d artagnan recognized the voice of de rochefort				1056.8599907404046
dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god				569.96684568075
a thousand pardons gentlemen but no doubt this man brings me the news i expected and rising also he went off at a quick pace				2087.372754676297
you remember said the count during the most profound silence that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it yes said danglars				333.5901549194424
it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan that is true said the king but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him				72.9266732388552
gaspard gaspard murmured the woman from her seat on the stairs mind what you are saying caderousse made no reply to these words though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the abbé said can a man be faithful to another whose wife he covets and desires for himself				327.2263964054531
calm and dignified said he				7.127324025951403
this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as possible whenever he met him or from asking in the kindest tone well monsieur cardinal how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor bernajoux of yours chapter vii				5807.621490265802
we must ask the comte de la fere the question				2074.7286228717526
breathe not a word of that or the comte de la fere will be furious you think the count will be angry with me think it				85.87901559196136
who asked his eminence				1327.994679312191
these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse oh exclaimed dantès his heart wrung with anguish				1722.5466181721365
on the first day of that month our four companions had landed at boulogne and in two parties had set out for paris				455.43630639246163
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks				2460.7180229260243
really if the house had not belonged to the father in law of the procureur one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had been committed villefort who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which were placed before him here took one and drank it off				1211.1575761504985
it is told that the duc d antin removed in a single night a whole avenue of trees that annoyed louis xiv				2616.037995845652
one man alone remained in his place gun in hand				319.42435977894075
a single look at milady apprised him of all that was passing in her mind				505.74049095937215
in doing us justice you will no longer treat us as men of vulgar stamp				53780.07011947039
now let us return to the first				1020.7035789609648
he recognized mordaunt who with bare sword was marshalling the musketeers behind the king and opposite the benches				13092.021300874225
alas continued the stranger doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered morcerf s brow we do not act thus in italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same lines and often the same uselessness all our lives but monsieur said the count of morcerf for a man of your merit italy is not a country and france opens her arms to receive you respond to her call				8894.762058654804
they knew the count s energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself				376.81634753575605
have you really no desire to meet him none whatever replied eugénie				2129.136332468823
porthos left the service and in the course of the following year married mme				162.8835776292426
some fragments of past splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging a sword for example richly embossed which belonged by its make to the times of francis i the hilt of which alone encrusted with precious stones might be worth two hundred pistoles and which nevertheless in his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for sale				112514.18476381118
how d artagnan and porthos earned by selling straw				4612.597035727499
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the sailors seated on a rock or undulating in the vessel one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and kisses				5226.1291707526225
oh said caderousse thunderstruck but for that black hair i should say you were the englishman lord wilmore i am neither the abbé busoni nor lord wilmore said monte cristo think again do you not recollect me there was a magic effect in the count s words which once more revived the exhausted powers of the miserable man				198.95011280038082
he even went so far as to show us the way out he led us to the park wall which we climbed over without accident and then we fell in with grimaud well exclaimed aramis this will reconcile me to him but i wish he were here that i might tell him that i did not believe him capable of so noble an act my lord said d artagnan no longer able to contain himself allow me to introduce to you the chevalier d herblay who wishes as you may have heard to offer his congratulations to your eminence and he retired discovering mazarin who was in great confusion to the astonished gaze of aramis				221.80967757731523
why that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not required me to make myself known why so because i am believed to be dead and have reasons for wishing nobody to know i am living so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent my secret from roaming over the fields the englishman looked at athos believing that he jested but athos did not jest the least in the world				675.6135123844826
an event took place in the church of st louis au marais				72866.92796125071
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me				121.0758533443088
athos offered the man half a pistole to accompany him but the man refused				6850.912320409537
that is a large sum				7543.287629575347
you see i can not escape even if i intended unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know i do not look round you then dantès rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the château d if				2487.1777752016933
on perceiving athos aramis advanced toward him took him by the hand and presented him to scarron				3531.026667751765
there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin				815.0492173662801
i see				694.8648625875621
d artagnan felt inclined for an instant to pursue master friquet but not wishing to leave raoul alone he contented himself with taking a pistol from the holster and cocking it				96.02957890740589
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek				17716.004188664567
then he saw a woman of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the two rooms				14465.325722157044
pardieu said d artagnan to himself to whose mind the niece of the theologian reverted pardieu it would be droll if this belated dove should be in search of our friend s house				399.2595176650171
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx like smile				535.1341339667856
what the devil do you want with a member of the parliament				4752.100321997396
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the baron and we will try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers go cornélie said madame danglars i do not require you any longer cornélie obeyed and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to debray				842.1531735792868
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal s death as a deliverance and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand				302.85249405752046
dantès could not understand a man risking his life for such matters				3357.0385097232825
no that is sufficient a man can pass through that porthos tried and passed the upper portion of his body through				1399.9871674536246
the count pretends i have not him to thank so be it i will erect an altar deo ignoto listen said monte cristo i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the father in law and the young man there is only mademoiselle eugénie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me and do you say this wedding is at hand oh yes in spite of all i could say				891.5071316598483
now madame danglars feared eugénie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eugénie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers				51959.36446010101
far beyond the door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be seen all craning to their utmost height to try and see				1085.6482327142269
why to accuse the man do you address the woman do i know m debray do i wish to know him do i wish to know that he gives advice do i wish to follow it do i speculate				67941.47156444169
the report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had taken place				878.2662643588377
god knows planchet that i should fly from a sight so sad if i did not wish to show my respect for the illustrious shadow of what was once the comte de la fere whom we loved so much planchet shook his head and said nothing				584.9373711458262
in the name of heaven cried dantès speak again though the sound of your voice terrifies me				109.94840973386071
it seems to me said d artagnan with a thousand livres each i do not speak as a spartan but as a procurator this word procurator roused porthos				267.5749769177168
it seemed to franz that he closed his eyes and in a last look about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a dream of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect				21459.97098216762
there could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged monte cristo then was in league with his father s enemies				1438.7886945677772
the executioner searched his face with the quick glance peculiar to those who are about to die and have no time to lose				2832.156991395749
planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her and found him				83.36334576462538
pardieu replied d artagnan for my part i am eating veal garnished with shrimps and vegetables and i some lamb chops said porthos				99.87601029735215
when she wakes she can sup and he made some steps toward the door				355.0530611187503
the prince leaped to his feet extending his hand in the direction whence came the sound there was no mistaking it it was the noise of cannon				15871.590572846733
adieu perhaps farewell at the hour agreed upon aramis arrived he was dressed as an officer and had the old sword at his side which he had drawn so often and which he was more than ever ready to draw				66199.08403615892
valentine found her grandmother in bed silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning tears were all that passed in this sad interview while madame de villefort leaning on her husband s arm maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow				44507.07627376528
why did he detain her				162.89188841807896
seven o clock said grimaud who had not spoken a word				633.4127630315462
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies				35105.06470902449
the past chapter				346.60986682996725
but i still trust you will not esteem me the less for it and that is my object beyond all others m de tréville was surprised to the greatest degree				102250.80089161209
i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence				2462.7006292545234
then he returned hastily shut his door carefully and began to study like a clever architect the plan andrea had left him				81.64763806063344
the extreme beauty of the countenance that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely grecian there were the large dark melting eyes the finely formed nose the coral lips and pearly teeth that belonged to her race and country				2830.8783777322105
just then the lamp again flickered the noise startled madame de villefort who shuddered and dropped the curtain				2886.656015150059
it was the soul of my husband well if my husband s soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter				2833.8023509798486
that will be sufficient you think so certainly very well then if they should hear of the separation ah yes what could i say that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari precisely				13023.642479443912
i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms				10049.619675929725
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them				128.4805769124779
what is this said aramis to juxon				31928.8850028725
this then continued aramis was my first opinion but as i am very ignorant in matters of this kind and as the humility which i profess obliges me not to rest on my own judgment but to ask the opinion of others i have inquired eh my friend aramis paused				3183.9441534984935
besides this as every great action bears its recompense with it the brave exploit of d artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost				1359.841158345373
towards the house the chestnut trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air				925.110453287555
believe me guilty as i was oh yes i too have suffered much have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your absence cried monte cristo thrusting his hands into his hair have you seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon no interrupted mercédès but i have seen him whom i loved on the point of murdering my son mercédès uttered these words with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense despair that monte cristo could not restrain a sob				16135.45185733156
it was a lovely starlight night they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its millions of phosphoric waves into light waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never rest as those of the sea sometimes do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp				3829.7070628742804
i who had sacrificed for you the baronne de i know it well the comtesse de monsieur porthos be generous you are right madame and i will not finish but it was my husband who would not hear of lending madame coquenard said porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which i preserve engraved in my memory the procurator s wife uttered a groan				1889.338466316475

my first duty directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to life was to restore it to its mother but in order to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to life partly on my sister s account and partly from that feeling of pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance				1499.410915759784
oh if that were so i should lose my reason and he folded her in his arms				512.0026943306112
the count however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three days rest with plenty of barley for their sole food during that time will bring them back to as fine that is as terrifying a condition as they were in yesterday				5372.191286992328
he kept on his way at the same rate heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road				2706.227224312175

it appeared however to milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening				15830.95622725201
mademoiselle eugénie however merely returned a dissenting movement of the head while with a cold smile she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle in which sat the countess g and where morcerf had just made his appearance				1213.648110748326

while the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of mademoiselle danglars i was reading the paper to my grandfather but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning you know you had told me all about it the previous evening i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the idea of speaking your name aloud and before so many people that i really think i should have passed it over but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could dear valentine well would you believe it				81.82165742800463
you are going now to pay your court to her again and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face it will be much worse than before instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen				3309.341762380806
you tell me said franz at the moment signor pastrini was about to open his mouth that you knew luigi vampa when he was a child he is still a young man then a young man				209.1578235715935
you are stupid replied the cardinal				191.8705025736024
oh is it you dear friends				403.96778878123513
danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor				2124.3568255907417
but i must see him instantly take care madame said athos for he knows neither his father nor his mother you have kept the secret				1468.1040215639462
the comte de la fere athos				215.3312630739463
he would then be lost and france perhaps with him				84.79168364833681
i would arrest ten of them ventrebleu a hundred even all the company and i would not allow a whisper from the moment they are suspected by your majesty said tréville the musketeers are guilty therefore you see me prepared to surrender my sword for after having accused my soldiers there can be no doubt that monsieur the cardinal will end by accusing me				113.94429255997338
the young girl looked at morrel				632.2148193437426
come in said franz				108.49392115639392
it was in the rue des france bourgeois close to la force				1649.47082068817
that will serve us for a relay said athos				12.29056601996648

finally as the hour for her interview with the count approached milady had everything about her darkened and ordered kitty to return to her own chamber and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself				356.51324201513467
milady was habitually pale her complexion might therefore deceive a person who saw her for the first time				356.0049683840614
then observe too that the woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex				9960.72048659698
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from nothing to make me what i am then count i admire you said villefort who for the first time in this strange conversation used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called monsieur				1314.6408111925236
during the six years which had passed since noirtier first fell into this sad state valentine s powers of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his wishes and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man s meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted				3013.718753134708
lord de winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it				88.95711603593006
at ten o clock the guns of the louvre announced the departure of the king and then a movement similar to that of trees in a stormy wind that bend and writhe with agitated tops ran though the multitude which was compressed behind the immovable muskets of the guard				1865.892215591442
his musketeers proceeded and followed him				73.82051661335824
the baroness then thought of m de villefort				528.8789525511343
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the house where we now are only instead of entering by the great door that looks into the street he came on horseback or in his carriage left the one or the other at the little inn and entered by the gate you see there monte cristo made a sign with his head to show that he could discern in the darkness the door to which bertuccio alluded				15073.466616475449
d artagnan with a sigh donned his uniform which he would have exchanged for that of a musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence				4544.0918590617
the old marshal turned toward the viscount grateful for that praise of his son whilst the prince exclaimed the young man is right let the prisoner be brought in meanwhile the prince took de guiche aside and asked him how the prisoner had been taken and who this young man was				1020.3965115315691
his brain was on fire and life and energy returned				707.8633672809317
if d artagnan forgets his host or appears to forget him under the pretense of not knowing where he has been carried we will not forget him and we know where he is				1071.3573868153164
did you see poor barrois die noirtier raised his eyes to heaven				806.481785399779
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error well then if it be so are you ready albert perfectly let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy yes let us do so the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said i signori francesi the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter				1904.8460075549813
i am going to fire gentlemen exclaimed d artagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are about				3409.491202767959

and what may be that description dark complexion hair eyebrows and whiskers black blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in his button hole a hat with wide brim and a cane ah ha that s it is it said noirtier and why then have they not laid hands on him because yesterday or the day before they lost sight of him at the corner of the rue coq héron didn t i say that your police were good for nothing yes but they may catch him yet true said noirtier looking carelessly around him true if this person were not on his guard as he is and he added with a smile he will consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance at these words he rose and put off his frock coat and cravat went towards a table on which lay his son s toilet articles lathered his face took a razor and with a firm hand cut off the compromising whiskers				51829.74889262689
i was about to become an abbé and all was arranged				11491.176015191479
arrived at ryston d artagnan assembled his friends				547.5351155338172
monte cristo shuddered and arose				2060.4979840762717
there one may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility i will inform you of in the drawing room namely that the credit of a banker is his physical and moral life that credit sustains him as breath animates the body and m de monte cristo once gave me a lecture on that subject which i have never forgotten				3000.7500290355238
adieu paris adieu his look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the night he passed his hand over his brow got into the carriage the door was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise				2204.294001076885
as for the numerous servants more numerous that evening than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the café de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their rooms thinking very little of their duty which was thus naturally interrupted				22231.042875220366
he removed his seat into a corner of the room where he himself would be in deep shadow while the light would be fully thrown on the narrator then with head bent down and hands clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole attention to caderousse who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him				76.75339573149387
i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible manner said he but valentine poor girl how will she bear so much sorrow as he thought thus he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains				12888.101878175243
it was like a besieged town				5745.859234329872
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise				2413.927878222155
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same				1743.170607474148
as the count was immensely rich excepting the danger carmela had run and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real misfortune the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle				70666.2805219569
you know sir that they wished to murder that good councillor broussel the father of the people really did they said d artagnan				36.85285592218883
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir				18275.424823752855
felton grew pale				591.4572105399658
franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon				3260.4813829889804
by no means				1713.4232198313462
do you wish for any further details				15658.581368026162
at this moment planchet brought out athos s horse the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle				2766.2850000833128
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm				13088.688090229667
and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker				60010.53846826838

first love is accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to overflow it will stifle you				181.87376978612397
d artagnan sprang up with a bound and at the same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the ground				1574.1567181807009
you no doubt observed the horses standing a few minutes since at the door certainly your excellency				2795.126672547864
i will tell it cried milady with a feigned exultation on the day when i shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith the look of felton revealed to milady the full extent of the space she had opened for herself by this single word				553.6665734528524
listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy if you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to god what do you say				903.7337269329156
so i shall never be a great man as he was but to compensate for that i shall be a good man monsieur de rochefort and i hope to prove it to you rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp like the hissing of young vipers				82921.62543645187
in a few minutes he had extracted three boards				48182.31233451732

he knit his brows and went direct to the tapestry which he pushed aside				5303.10058044874
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence				681.6413964408649
can he be afraid of this boy but an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short he bowed humbly and retired				770.6357651531895
he passed through several apartments of an elegance of which even the greatest nobles of france had not even an idea and arrived at length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of richness				55837.47828602066
if you heard the cry of mad dog you would take your gun you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog				5234.304375550248

a moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing room and went to open the door himself				379.94092983961315
suddenly an idea occurred to him he smiled and the perspiration dried on his forehead				1444.7230374599123
she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect				9929.734623732125
after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed towards an angel those suspicions which even when there is no crime are always alive in my heart but after the death of valentine there has been no doubt in my mind madame and not only in mine but in those of others thus your crime known by two persons suspected by many will soon become public and as i told you just now you no longer speak to the husband but to the judge the young woman hid her face in her hands				534.5233462445143
he was like a soldierly automaton or rather like a magnificent marionette				44493.92018936957

i felt myself fall to the ground my mother had fainted haydée s arms fell by her side and she uttered a deep groan at the same time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands				12221.437318837006
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that d artagnan heard her in the antechamber				3561.4709423462646

eh egad to give up broussel as they demand				26402.40854883356
the queen entered the great hall and it was remarked that like the king she looked dull and even weary				129261.6847454896
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire				50556.4992294162
i am called louis the just monsieur de tréville and by and by by and by we will see ah sire it is because i confide in that justice that i shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your majesty wait then monsieur wait said the king i will not detain you long in fact fortune changed and as the king began to lose what he had won he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing charlemagne if we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance				7004.40014880457
then d artagnan as the reader from whom we have not concealed the state of his fortune very well knows d artagnan was not a millionaire he hoped to become one someday but the time which in his own mind he fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant				7277.827393876975

our family although still rich for my father s income amounts to half a million has experienced many misfortunes and i myself was at the age of five years taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen years i have not seen the author of my existence				4749.55857465916
as soon as possible i am at your command sir shall we return together if not unpleasant to you on the contrary i shall feel much pleasure thus the future father and son in law stepped into the same carriage and morrel seeing them pass became uneasy				2442.04827348063
as a punishment for having spoken without permission my friend you will please to eat this piece of paper then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us you shall afterward drink this glass of wine				1098.6325157847305
we avoid imprisonment and we play the part of heroes the choice is easy it is true but in everything friend one must always return to the same question a stupid one i admit but very necessary have you any money something like a hundred pistoles that my farmer sent to me the day before i left bragelonne but out of that sum i ought to leave fifty for raoul a young man must live respectably				42423.04493657381

she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh				2434.5502097172
what is my daughter doing asked madame danglars				166.2690744712494
he has escaped by this means exclaimed he				15.161871999966372
the woman especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals				46577.761212447906
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud				972.7786042939775
abraham raised the knife against isaac and isaac was his son yes said cromwell but the lord did not suffer that sacrifice to be accomplished i have looked around me said mordaunt and i have seen neither goat nor kid caught among the bushes of the plain cromwell bowed				1274.5788313593764
never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope				1541.8581233976442
sir said milady is your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity				2205.8038821710793
it is magnificent said cavalcanti who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words				731.7266455124308
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition				48784.22107493901
paris is a horrible place in summer				51470.85969149821
you blackguard cried athos going toward him i ll cut your ears off at the same instant four men armed to the teeth entered by side doors and rushed upon athos				241.73004306697905
in the bosom of this corpse was plunged a poniard the gold hilt of which shone in the moonbeams				45501.001532225106
but talking of heat is there nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we will resume our conversation from where we left off as you please sir said caderousse who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his possession hastily raised a trap door in the floor of the apartment they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen				3120.5333167443996
but this time the papers were a mere matter of form				2498.360528215562
one thing above all the rest heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of danglars for cavalcanti				3092.639948360328
athos according to his system neither encouraged nor dissuaded him				58.385280302006606

mademoiselle de villefort my step daughter said madame de villefort to monte cristo leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards valentine with her hand				297.3035428995846
therefore he knew nothing either of the enemy s numbers or of those in command or of the purpose of the army				2634.9068953702567
the innkeeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty five years of age tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes he had dark sparkling and deep set eyes hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal his hair like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in spite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads				78893.19826001416
during the six years that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished				16421.37111804566
he made a movement of surprise and said father you are very young men who bear my robe have no age replied the monk dryly				103430.74758274488
you do not know what felicity from heaven what joys from paradise are comprised in a moment like that				646.8846335258796
haydée had remained until the close of the meeting				3582.5676020535807
danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young girls in attendance on the bride by whose side walked dantès father the whole brought up by fernand whose lips wore their usual sinister smile				583.060746908652
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a post chaise is an event				4273.659126239971
mademoiselle de villefort will share them with you for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her from her father now a madman and her brother who died last september with his mother				1617.777750032803
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused				6820.013235940445
be kind enough then madame to act more compliantly the conduct is infamously violent				51195.53657307577
well undermine in them the miserable prejudice of respect and fear of kings teach your flocks that the queen is a tyrant and repeat often and loudly so that all may know it that the misfortunes of france are caused by mazarin her lover and her destroyer begin this work to day this instant even and in three days i shall expect the result				9130.530194403542
they had traveled onward about half a mile when planchet came close up to d artagnan				88.28458772664143
bonacieux of whom his head if not his heart was already full				14196.476144503602
well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly				18640.638934133247
the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens paper and a penknife				19120.142119937776
go the count signified his intention of dining alone and that no one but ali should attend him				69.10695021994431
the beggar of st eustache				3847.791958493208
the first act of franz was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness				45192.74417653659
mounting on the breach with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other he said bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers who astonished at this apparition stopped fifty paces from the bastion gentlemen a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion				3131.217450720935
monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown				14241.550570029258
morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself by the arm of the chair				1153.9556375848763
come said he to himself be a man				222.84968335099808

the two gentlemen were obliged therefore to get off their horses and take a boat and in that strange manner they approached the louvre				9045.688602762233
we hear from yanina chapter				181.7140939967602
the beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms				530.6679750469561
it is you who stabbed selim				4718.632405472254
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast on me and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his lifeless cheeks				2455.2503736774665
he cast his eyes around and saw the horn full of powder which his friend jacopo had left him				77.52317140896093
what a devil of a face you have porthos				169.48425775618225

i did think of it but this letter has neither date nor postmark true said porthos				40.69234151378753
they had understood each other without speaking				2788.4159942015617

pull down the blinds said d artagnan				5.74507788211302
we were too devoted servants to refuse him a request of that sort				10915.710644638
this is torture to me cried athos				19.030646319497638
yes replied the man but at what a price listen friend said monte cristo				149.79251717105018
go young men				735.2518185756139
it shall be as you wish madame said villefort more especially since your wishes coincide with mine and as soon as m d épinay arrives in paris my dear grandmother interrupted valentine consider decorum the recent death				688.2945565280301
three months since it was m de saint méran madame de saint méran two months since the other day it was barrois today the old noirtier or young valentine you knew it cried morrel in such a paroxysm of terror that monte cristo started he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved you knew it and said nothing and what is it to me replied monte cristo shrugging his shoulders do i know those people				1083.1765525533624
this scrutiny was so much the more easy the coachman being sound asleep				3238.621024041953
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air				915.0339271985661
yes madame well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes i am sorry to say i can not replied the baron and i was just asking the same question of albert are you very anxious to know countess asked albert				730.7402319932712

diplomat or not i don t know i only know that he charged himself on my account with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been king i should have instantly created him knight of all my orders even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter well since we are not to sit down to table said debray take a glass of sherry and tell us all about it you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa it is a road your ancestors have traced for you said albert gallantly				52416.851582599236
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door				348.42703537644695
morrel had no particular reason for uneasiness monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live and so far he had always fulfilled his word				595.71814658207
franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket and presented it to the man who had spoken to him				74.78505837311414
but milady felt herself denounced even by his terror				1004.6811616172024
you had no pity for that youthfulness that beauty that weakness				4858.608071409424
he was masked likewise but i knew his step i knew his voice i knew him by that imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse of humanity				8953.400343575144
i also intend from this time to work on my own account				2123.0626414040844
since my misfortunes i have been subject to faintnesses which seize me all at once and i have just felt a cold shiver				77026.62304889662
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments				74591.85843544232
whilst supper is being prepared he said smiling you will not my friend be sorry to have the mystery which so puzzles you cleared up true monsieur le comte replied d artagnan who felt that by degrees athos was resuming that great influence which aristocracy had over him				72.30814063011867
gracious me said porthos there s phoebus ruined the cardinal will pay you a hundred pistoles i m above that let us set out again at full gallop yes if we can but at last the lieutenant s horse refused to go on he could not breathe one last spur instead of making him advance made him fall				3979.395158792249
the two young persons obeyed				1520.5088786163312
i went to france with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life				537.4002514393669
devil take the vain fellow said d artagnan				6.64779963049772
sir said valentine i will do all i can to live for there are two beings who love me and will die if i die my grandfather and maximilian i will watch over them as i have over you well sir do as you will with me and then she added in a low voice oh heavens what will befall me whatever may happen valentine do not be alarmed though you suffer though you lose sight hearing consciousness fear nothing though you should awake and be ignorant where you are still do not fear even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin				18626.795717114128
besides according to all probability they will wait at the door d artagnan made a violent effort over himself to keep his face from being too expressive				19750.046056375366
as soon as the door of gondy s study was opened a man rushed in				1127.0479970225633
you have misunderstood me all sympathy is extinct between us ingrate that you are ah				319.2547277048882
a longer stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence				18358.69707025451
come in tréville the duke saluted and retired				776.2208382921627
sometimes grimaud who feared his master as he did fire while entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration for his talents believed he perfectly understood what he wanted flew to execute the order received and did precisely the contrary				8316.661866620781
they halted for the king to dine				22897.828930969757

your pardon sir replied villefort quite astounded but you will excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men				812.126800735315
now take your courage in both hands and hear what this gentleman in black is going to say about his sovereign with full license and privilege never till then had a more brutal accusation or meaner insults tarnished kingly majesty				4062.9311810744694
d artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume				66361.78636248804
there was no great cunning necessary				4661.395387923188
he saw that he was on the highest point of the island a statue on this vast pedestal of granite nothing human appearing in sight while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island and covered it with a fringe of foam				9547.374669880457
in fact d artagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests				7134.523121899733
a dripping pan immediately that i may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird you was right said the swiss goose grease is kood with basdry there said the dragoon				36773.23532049125
a tear which appeared in the old man s eye expressed his thanks to the doctor				2049.6080957935997
my friend monsieur du vallon is of a very melancholy disposition so much so that one can scarcely get three words out of him all day				457.74237864443853
during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape				2081.299104386525
i don t know much about it said athos				11.70470594246795

you want to know how we came here				681.4873487079276
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid				36047.22567989824
the peasants were in great commotion				18851.77322815826
a folded paper fell from edward s breast				1566.6699157909577
at what said milady with the utmost ingenuousness				16214.956666638827
albert saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my mother he threw his arms around her neck				5549.196727736742
how is it that i have never met you at his house i am no acquaintance of m de villefort s answered morrel but i was of madame de saint méran albert came up to them at this moment with franz				749.3366201940563
there remained then no other place to fear but the traitor s cross the carriage was taking the direct road to it				96.95490075530685
what a disgrace to us oh never fear				1040.1559280483586
well ask your worthy jailer what favor i this instant solicited of him you demanded a favor said the baron suspiciously				184132.90505596358
monte cristo was more affectionate than ever indeed his manner was so kind that several times morrel was on the point of telling him all				664.0812476227928
villefort smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance				4449.665576047306
at twelve this man was replaced by another functionary and danglars wishing to catch sight of his new guardian approached the door again				469.11789434062575
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at length				10017.182161158873
i took him to the rue payenne to exactly the same spot where a year before at the very same hour he had paid me the compliment i have related to you				162.69929588448068
what is life to you nothing				497.39901327781837
the company looked at each other in consternation				90891.2879641376
the latter a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty two years active and lively the true soubrette of a great lady jumped from the step upon which according to the custom of the time she was seated and took her way toward the terrace upon which d artagnan had perceived lubin				88523.86454857701
what then ah my dear count said albert				185.02879034604905
gentlemen resumed the newcomer you are as i am in search of a woman who added he with a terrible smile must have passed this way for i see a corpse the three friends remained mute for although the voice as well as the countenance reminded them of someone they had seen they could not remember under what circumstances				1839.1334515539386
buckingham had returned to london mme				128.6524769406095
he conjured the evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks				46913.17935033282
he recovered a little reopened his eyes and hope revived in all hearts				9117.982533953933
mousqueton at the head of them wiped his eyes				399.6873441840764
and now i am a frondeur not of broussel s party nor of blancmesnil s nor am i with viole but with the duc de beaufort the ducs de bouillon and d elbeuf with princes not with presidents councillors and low born lawyers				93116.39678822804
where am i said she				34.06858251093809
but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste i must go to paris ah really to paris				430.79027727912853
more than two thousand persons had assisted as at a spectacle in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends an undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive				5367.920136186506
you have heard what i said				250.68605845003526
what has the count done				1617.0165410440507
morcerf like most other young men of rank and fortune had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance he had moreover his right of entry into the omnibus box				1101.1835708940146
what comments must be made and if the fronde knows that monseigneur has disappeared how the fronde must triumph it is frightful murmured mazarin				894.297619620154
edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray				41299.940282667005
let this house be the first repaid my son and respect this man father i will said maximilian				1991.6197459950965
villefort from his study heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a house the opening and shutting of doors the ringing of madame de villefort s bell to summon the waiting maid mingled with the first shouts of the child who rose full of the enjoyment of his age				2788.790972353407
what do you think of the count inquired debray he is not much amiss according to my ideas of good looks the count repeated eugénie as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the count oh he is so dreadfully pale i quite agree with you said morcerf and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out				385.6298044291896
at dessert d artagnan reposed in his chair crossed one leg over the other and lounged about like a man perfectly at his ease				4754.9336388240245
who goes there was asked a second time				323.11674779809516
when the clock strikes a quarter after midnight collect your men				826.5700588875611
although m de villefort flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the feelings which were passing in his mind he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his brow so much so that the count whose smile was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air				886.8711434214047
la ramee followed all these objects with his eyes his alarm every moment increasing				64923.50710466051
he resolved then to carry on the war alone and to look for no success foreign to himself but as we look for a fortunate chance				6723.858395152999
grimaud made a sign to denote that he had done so				506.7567768714193
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these bank notes it seemed to me that i was in a dream and as it always happens in a dream i felt myself riveted to the spot				2635.6658832586613
and you say that by his will he leaves me five hundred thousand livres are you sure of it he showed it me but that is not all there is a codicil as i said just now probably and in that codicil he acknowledges me oh the good father the brave father the very honest father said caderousse twirling a plate in the air between his two hands				445.71870783831
the man came straight toward him				75.99717024365557
let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone my dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me said athos				78.97961168542176
she was walking with her nurse marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback i stopped				1107.0939828773714
bonacieux had also reflected but it must be admitted upon something widely different from ambition				1894.4372592165741
no monsieur jester replied d artagnan but with our four horses we may bring back our three friends if we should have the good fortune to find them living which is a great chance replied planchet but we must not despair of the mercy of god amen said d artagnan getting into his saddle				2864.715011030264
my god my lord i have long despised thee				4750.654847908813
have you seen the king yes and all goes well we are to meet our friends at the hotel at eleven it was then striking half past ten by st paul s				1121.51653291803

milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single pang				61079.513431348096
you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felice s daughter				1652.5442896756545
ah ha said albert i see you were preparing for a game of cards no said the count i was making a suit how said albert				499.005877453214
no one answered				6781.1972494228685
the sum was collected in a minute				4438.785752760373
the worthy sergeant had recognized the minister s secretary and the millionnaire and by way of paying extra attention to his noble neighbors promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to beauchamp				767.7034533426945
you know you may say anything to me				96.39071887379609
the door opened and the man in the mantle reappeared				2869.411074715909
monsieur she said i i do not understand you and in her first paroxysm of terror she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the other she fell down again on the cushions				37585.45162784486
free chapter xxiv				21637.588100153527
noble heart murmured d artagnan				9.560899825293987
come come murmured d artagnan rochefort has kept his promise but where in the devil is he and he searched the cabinet even to the smallest recesses but there was no sign of rochefort				1209.3628047164514
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot				1780.894260458072
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned				718.9464830353925
suppose he is dead and that this property now belongs to some one who bears his name				940.258809502587
by the lord my good host				990.1191021443582

if the emperor remained on the throne gérard required a different alliance to aid his career if louis xviii				1850.2853157679865
where were you born continued the president				1518.5156146130487
through the darkness franz whose eyes were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky point he saw the fire more brilliant than ever and about it five or six persons seated				7868.052057924708
no you sounded me nothing more				1033.9602578251483
i beg a thousand pardons said the count there is nothing the matter but i slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my elbow				12918.989371359525
stop my friend i have an idea speak monsieur in your place i would do one thing what while his eminence was seeking for me in paris i would take without sound of drum or trumpet the road to picardy and would go and make some inquiries concerning my three companions				875.213160126012
oh unhappy woman cried the commissary				5409.025583368888
the rest of the floor was hired by a very rich gentleman who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged				5738.663446505318
the inspector begged the englishman to seat himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the château d if giving him all the time he desired for the examination while de boville seated himself in a corner and began to read his newspaper				57829.91372917331
they passed into the eating room a large dark room situated opposite the kitchen				2862.6189642821964
it was a quarter past midday				17618.399589445973
for the poison which she pours there is no antidote yes yes				1076.767759086049
aramis alighted and clapped his hands three times				2641.7444025592313
was he awake or was it but a dream				1848.9068183967743
oh work work my passion my joy my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the hand of d avrigny				2040.3775444701
aramis tried to withdraw his hand but the king still held it				100.55083434552253
but the wound remains and will reopen at the first loss no for i am only embarked in certainties replied danglars with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust well such things have been that there should be a famine recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine or that the sea should become dry as in the days of pharaoh and even then my vessels would become caravans so much the better				1009.7018555046451
this is the first time i have gone without my dinner for ten years and it is generally my best meal what do you think d artagnan asked athos				120.67688109324097
have we ceased to be men no said aramis but that fellow is a fiend and ask the uncle whether i was wrong to rid him of his dear nephew de winter only replied by a groan				1900.198458615646
felton then had spoken in her favor since lord de winter had not been willing to listen to him				74.63426058582583
very well until the moment when the comte de la fere resumed raoul said come bragelonne draw your sword then only i rushed upon the reptile and cut it in two just at the moment when it was rising on its tail and hissing ere it sprang upon me				107.32077618807256
duty before everything				917.0314055518121
our swords cried d artagnan raising his head and regaining his self possession				2927.1061790723666
a tailor said the host and for what to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes returned albert				983.2401613418299
you must depart instantly monsieur				1222.6688755506275
the next morning at daybreak valentine and morrel were walking arm in arm on the seashore valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room explained everything revealed the crime and finally how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death				691.0939097714008
the standard very well in half an hour we shall be on board and the friends spurring on their horses rode to the hotel the arms of england what do you say of that young man asked d artagnan as they hurried along				9139.18960493775
after breakfast the abbess came to pay her a visit				1502.5493604254896
speak make haste bind my arms my lord fast why bind thee that i may not be considered as your accomplice your hands asked grimaud				647.1419391831272
i don t very well know				1030.2951696448692
la ramee s mouth watered and he returned to the duke s chamber rubbing his hands				531.8920846816445
we must first see what the sergeant wishes us to do replied d artagnan				9.513503874445405
madame danglars therefore came not only beautiful in person but radiant with splendor she entered by one door at the time when mercédès appeared at the door				345.4509068856257
comminges left the head of the escort and went to the queen s carriage				1346.6036171919397
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no suspicion of it				100.98732387197059
it was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility				13736.699271224208
your horses are ready saddled in their stables are they not he said turning to d artagnan				12.89041771316052
hearing of your refusal to obey her she looked upon it as a declaration of war and as she considers you a man of superior talent and consequently dangerous she desired me to make sure of you that is the reason of your being shut up in the bastile				7446.892716100355
they were assembled in council at the residence of athos which always indicated an event of some gravity				7377.67450619449
depart then depart i implore you oh how beautiful you are thus				1735.1935209553933
morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream				1854.7338410793914
no and yet they refused to buy it why said château renaud				630.9234644315047
this important task was just completed as they arrived at the countess s box				1090.311102302801
they then dressed themselves				3282.379734039181
i am a frondist from my heart				399.34900712621993
no emmanuel i am but a man and your admiration is as unmerited as your words are sacrilegious and pressing his lips on the hand of julie who rushed into his arms he extended his other hand to emmanuel then tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness he made a sign to maximilian who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the death of valentine had so stunned him				82.03366932844374
to lift their hands against a minister of god come here sir said urban an old soldier who had served under the cardinal duke in all his campaigns come here there is nothing to be done with him whilst we may perhaps be able to save the other the wounded man smiled sadly				3393.857962105966
monte cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl s arm drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal smile my child believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the love of maximilian valentine gave him a look full of gratitude and remained as docile as a child				771.3563386508335
but what raised public astonishment to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the evening walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman s hut and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after persons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen years				999.0530691152427
toward midnight charles heard a great noise beneath his window				700.9435050663443
returned home with athos aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview but d artagnan confined himself to telling them that m de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign and that he had refused				6400.665800257068
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room				205.33722456476673
nothing had as yet occurred to shake cocles belief the last month s payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude cocles had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same evening he had brought them to m morrel who with a melancholy smile threw them into an almost empty drawer saying thanks cocles you are the pearl of cashiers cocles went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of m morrel himself the pearl of the honest men of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns				5700.7857699913975
the snow deadened the noise of his fall				3964.281694246026
besides he wore the uniform of the guards which next to that of the musketeers was most admired by the ladies				12391.94354688984
i was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world leave us				526.4356052498958
as to felton he hesitates				52308.18916476472
yet this catalan has eyes that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards sicilians and calabrians and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow				2460.54906462917
m noirtier de villefort we will now relate what was passing in the house of the king s attorney after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter and during the time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine which we have just detailed				79589.04439455966
i can discover and explain to you my grandfather s thoughts so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears on the subject				1761.4576936894643
do you think it is worth while said villefort				215.8004984260147
one could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak				1369.8316167549422
no he warms me with his rays and it is by his light that i see you nothing more				1170.6515152150532
edmond listened intently an hour passed two hours passed and no sound was heard from the wall all was silent there				983.4169319626955
yes she said at your advice i have made the trial and have you succeeded i think so madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room monte cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips she returned to consciousness				8939.612547979155
he arrived at his usual hour with a proud look and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the door keepers or the coolness of his colleagues				7929.383843539769
tomorrow at the hôtel field of the cloth of gold a lackey in black and red will wait for your reply oh said d artagnan this is rather warm it appears that milady and i are anxious about the health of the same person				1295.3989566378993
you may see matters differently d artagnan and think otherwise				4445.267208858778
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide				24115.832538631865
nor i nor i chorused the sailors				2312.638350265323
do you think she said with a ghastly smile that i shall be inclined to reopen this coffer to answer any future accusations mazarin overcome by this determination read the two letters				64626.558635792775
ah i have been running very fast mademoiselle but i must do m morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass				967.0870953329432
andrea assumed his gayest manner				898.9321352067427
in royal antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to be seen at all				648.3026274352522
i once knew a bragelonne is he still alive no sir he is dead and i believe it is from him my guardian whose near relation he was inherited the estate from which i take my name and your guardian sir asked the queen who could not help feeling some interest in the handsome young man before her what is his name the comte de la fere madame replied the young man bowing				2738.238356195572
the young greek as we have already said occupied apartments wholly unconnected with those of the count				277.8733175417261
it was no longer a rival who was beloved it was himself who was apparently beloved				70460.09093985535
so without losing time tell me have you the slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot beauchamp proceeded to relate to the young man who was overwhelmed with shame and grief the following facts				4857.00976660182
just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced touch it not grimaud he cried grimaud				636.8261609280133
only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as i have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession				2907.4934589501004
instantly a mask wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance				2866.529636922462
but is not your eminence going to the queen for what purpose monsieur de guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army it is well i will go comminges had seen rightly and mordaunt had really acted as he had related				8355.385524613255
the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but napoleon returned a special levy was made and fernand was compelled to join				55253.042627755734
but to return to what we were saying				11625.255528749065
d artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon d artagnan s sword				1120.392452688833
you see in me such as i am a person sentenced to be hung and on what account i rescued from the hands of mazarin s police a noble lord whom they were conducting back to the bastile where he had been for five years will you name him oh you know him well my lord it is count de rochefort ah				365.36297226661003
i could defy a nation be quiet porthos said d artagnan we are observed we are admired i faith answered porthos				90.61129936013778
yez what s the dream said the swiss				2447.700102620941
she will be the sooner with her mother				1577.9970449095058
and the headsman of bethune gave me a reply de winter fell back in a chair as though struck by a thunderbolt and in vain attempted a reply				704.036979886339
but how can lord de winter my protector my father asked felton possibly be mixed up with all this listen felton resumed milady for by the side of base and contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures				52351.40739857521
how long i had been in this unconscious state i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol followed by a fearful cry				1791.5306641697075
accomplish the orders of lord de winter said felton with a gloomy smile				603.4339128114551

you are not hurt asked d artagnan				7.595650123593139
alas said edmond smiling these are the treasures the cardinal has left and the good abbé seeing in a dream these glittering walls has indulged in fallacious hopes but he called to mind the words of the will which he knew by heart				425.3886880799713

m de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin				14465.353312602596
athos glanced at aramis				218.16913171711246
she reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others				699.5848176756691
d artagnan who though wanting in practice had a sound theory redoubled his agility				59325.53714249564

your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice				3474.5828701952278
athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes				389.86341921354386
a moment later he came down again holding in his hand the small shagreen case which he opened to assure himself it contained the diamond seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in then as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his head				497.34185658403254
the count had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that anyone should be admitted				3737.6576928452923

sir he said after a pause a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither but as during the greater portion of the year this island is deserted if the secret of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my return my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the rest of mankind at pleasure				1376.714495476248

then an idea came to him which harmonized everything				1068.1672086823182
porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar				9367.632887219284
it was in fact mordaunt whom d artagnan had followed without knowing it				80.96834109076303
do you know that he asked				766.7211855831955
my dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box why i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask at that instant the countess perceived franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head				476.4195465169325
as for the ink said faria i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from time to time as i require it one thing still puzzles me observed dantès and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight i worked at night also replied faria				4484.834183085895
gondy bowed respectfully				4330.209158215087
it is not i who strike m de morcerf it is providence which punishes him and why do you represent providence cried mercédès				1413.2743052901192
aramis discharged his bill placed bazin in the cart with his comrades and they set forward to join porthos				261.06732596361536
then wait said aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock				1897.3211004534317
do not surrender egad				2302.524036961634
and what grimaud dictated				84672.34023584785
then who reigns in france at this moment napoleon ii				3960.072304786122
leave all to me and tomorrow when you awake you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be satisfied my dear albert said franz leave all to our host he has already proved himself full of resources let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see l italienne à alger agreed returned albert but remember signor pastrini that both my friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the costumes we have asked for the host again assured them they might rely on him and that their wishes should be attended to upon which franz and albert mounted to their apartments and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their costumes				44449.34575476432
however ill our two friends were mounted they were soon far in advance of their servants and arrived at crèvecœur				205124.98199170656
oh heaven forbid				33312.903844940636
as for me i hate the court and have but one desire at this moment vengeance				1498.4345781362172
a thousand livres				2131.6749577459386
say rather crime replied the doctor				1928.1049488018016
no it has been stolen from you stolen				17067.807073164393
he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive				85137.35882482657
ah count he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss and she took two or three steps forward				776.2234292130576
i know not whom look and judge for yourself thank you i understand				1624.7966229502258
the white flag morbleu we must not leave a flag in the hands of the enemy even if that flag be but a napkin and athos ran back to the bastion mounted the platform and bore off the flag but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range they opened a terrible fire upon this man who appeared to expose himself for pleasure s sake				5668.983167866653
indeed the name of bernajoux was known to all the world d artagnan alone excepted perhaps for it was one of those which figured most frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal could not repress				12481.359585660275
she is what the english call a yacht where was she built i know not but my own opinion is she is a genoese and how did a leader of smugglers continued franz venture to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at genoa i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the sailor				3746.9512068864888
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young man being no other than andrea the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their steps towards his room				200.32080011584597
they have selected a field of battle on which i am an abler general than they that of a conference				9264.8384753281
but one fine day i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred francs a year and employed all day not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the water like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white bellied black clawed fellow insect four or five leagues distant from him				79.30328648946772
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river that s well said d artagnan				62.96854685545344
that dark point yonder is the isle of dogs				13304.165268164363
my mother applied her eye to the crack between the boards i luckily found a small opening which afforded me a view of the apartment and what was passing within				2654.6181259799223
you didn t know king charles to you he was only a foreigner and you were not obliged to love him so saying he stretched out his hand but the other pretended not to see it and he let it drop again slowly by his side				1437.1615761556984
i regret not having heard them				111.79333197538558
and your third attack if indeed you should have another will find you at liberty				1561.904299088146
sacré bleu said athos				10.44548128255564
come come tell me i am dying with curiosity and uneasiness athos said d artagnan getting rid of his female garments and appearing in his shirt prepare yourself to hear an incredible an unheard of story well but put on this dressing gown first said the musketeer to his friend				733.1753749320932
why said aramis one half were hanged and the other half were shot well i said d artagnan i answer that while there remains a drop of blood in my veins you will be neither hanged nor shot				21429.5598714369
as i had expected i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand marshal but i sent the ring i had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted				3758.270843873344
as he had said on a camp bed dressed in his black doublet booted unbelted with his felt hat beside him lay the king overcome by sleep and fatigue				5133.019707139915
at his right hand was placed the superior of the jesuits and on his left the curate of montdidier				67441.42618996969
this horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs and i don t like to humiliate people then your duchess is still at the waters asked d artagnan				93.14587502268279
not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted everything depends on you explain yourself pray monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba				4563.66100390491
a king said d artagnan it s a good omen master groslow look out for the king and in spite of his extraordinary self control there was a strange vibration in the gascon s voice which made his partner start				6371.718428632436
d artagnan and planchet entered pierrefitte together				730.533285509756
well go and fetch them and come to my apartment				708.9635747104679
that is not all the money gained in the exercise of my profession i have distributed to the poor i have been assiduous in attending church and those who formerly fled from me have become accustomed to seeing me				118.18752841273148
this feeling was so strong that at the moment when edmond was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest rock and from thence gazed round in every direction				2574.7605289385237
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color				5979.154395179014
it was an embarrassing load for a man seeking to escape i had not for a moment the idea of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures				4317.335692162564
grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully				4363.755229593972
but felton that s another thing				1565.5266050866105
the king wishes to get a sleep one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone				2108.9378771348092
yes and to hang me they shall not have the king nor hang me listen				1673.4437252848816
there are ten men to accompany you				160.8856270866518
he stopped however at the door for an instant				1065.1917110579584
finally the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same manner and the result of the sitting was that the procurator s wife should give eight hundred livres in money and should furnish the horse and the mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and mousqueton to glory				8244.106626294299
monsieur de comminges he said				358.84197776431614
cowardly court				985.6041041930456
but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peter s and a month to study it				95.68685499180552
but i know you to be a man of honor the count again struck the gong				10174.541691325812
there are only a dozen men at the most that would be nothing for us four it is too much for us two				1326.1633547035065
but i m his cousin he told me everything and desired me to watch instead of him and in his place to conduct wherever they wished to go the gentlemen who should bring me a handkerchief tied at each corner like that one which you hold and one which i have in my pocket and he drew out the handkerchief				4121.988442716317
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound silence				896.2408569117713
have i not from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas				4307.453071194745
in short at the moment in which she has just obtained from richelieu a carte blanche by the means of which she is about to take vengeance on her enemy this precious paper is torn from her hands and it is d artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to some filthy botany bay some infamous tyburn of the indian ocean				2312.4376581283204
she continued to look at him for nearly ten minutes and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned round once				2229.184532527803
it was the man he called his phantom it was his stranger of meung of the rue des fossoyeurs and of arras				17645.505590324432
good evening m beauchamp said monte cristo as if this was the first time he had seen the journalist that evening be seated beauchamp bowed and sitting down sir said he i just now accompanied m de morcerf as you saw and that means replied monte cristo laughing that you had probably just dined together				785.9858437244153
the keeper relaxed his hold				2482.643173157754
i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon				5228.0134718791605
after this second part of his discourse fixing his hawk s eye upon poor bonacieux he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation				1254.9409846713334
seven men in two days and those of his very best				5961.850599946649
gentlemen good morning as he left the room debray called out loudly my carriage bravo said beauchamp to albert i shall not go to the chamber but i have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m danglars for heaven s sake beauchamp returned morcerf do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere				12507.836432724713
she received him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages				21591.826388881138
then if he persists notwithstanding all this as that is as i have said the limit of my mission i shall have nothing to do but to pray god to work a miracle for the salvation of france				766.2986671141371
it seems a likely story to me and to me too besides we can but blow out his brains if he proves false said the gascon and you athos you know something of everything and can be our captain				717.3158243685145
when porthos heard the key turn in the lock he began to be alarmed lest they should only have exchanged one prison for another				765.7931207928629
but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida				44574.742952544046
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m de saint méran s and he arranged mentally while dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence				27947.336075867406
uneasiness took possession of the tender constant heart of athos and fearful forecasts were the torment of the impulsive aramis				371.86697127506363
he hastened with franz to seat himself free to recommence the discussion after dinner				4010.514147410914
who is in command here asked the cardinal				219.66049899550788
what happened then she asked				766.0480439274531
ah my worthy gentlemen cried i what do you want you must have a ladder said he who appeared to be the leader of the party				2642.6326275832557
that evening he had a long conference with several friends and m cavalcanti who had remained in the drawing room with the ladies was the last to leave the banker s house				411.0212061852239
but what the devil are you about aramis continued athos				126.74707984600792
the fact was nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of vampa or that of a jockey styled job when at the last moment a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the starting post				2640.124948229677
no one would listen or believe me because everyone thought me mad but you who must know that i am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you will alas murmured edmond to himself this is a terrible relapse				52998.877263692026
bonacieux what is that noise that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness				7890.760520950019
do you talk of your honor				3182.5719757803904
remain then where you are and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue				5071.273633396649
all looked around athos himself stared				73807.60628966334
however continued monte cristo drawing a small phial from his pocket i have an infallible remedy so saying he bowed to the baroness and her daughter exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the count and left madame danglars box				1077.9184855782587
certainly women alone know how to dissimulate said monte cristo to himself glancing at madame danglars who was smiling on the procureur and embracing his wife				1171.9523088021156
at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner				1347.9675083192692
pardon me doctor these worldly ideas were you a priest i should not dare tell you that but you are a man and you know mankind				73325.89822436738
the chateau he said to himself what chateau				15004.022463955496
he pushed on toward him but before he could reach it the shadow had disappeared into an alley into which grimaud deemed it scarcely prudent to pursue it				94.46777598056977
my letter is private and confidential and for that reason i send it to you by a man who shares my most intimate counsels				17233.329077974635
a passport for embarkation must be obtained and the party must be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to london				1634.2716076047786
ja replied the gascon determined to confine himself to this specimen of the german tongue				2564.3544058990633
almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of time a cab arrived and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs				3085.0546347744084
a quick glance conveyed his thought to porthos if athos knows where we are if he opens communication with us before long athos will act porthos was not very quick to understand the language of glances but now since the name of athos had suggested to him the same idea he understood				2725.8818146873427
oh yes said buckingham grating his teeth with rage				2176.567636877905
the footman was withdrawing but athos stopped him by a sign				3725.9310727689526
this did not seem sufficient the man or rather the ghost for he trod so softly that no sound was heard then poured out about a spoonful into the glass and drank it				93.120162047472
this time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh such a real ear clipper did porthos appear				7769.425836502701
at the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in adelmonte s country this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a rock where it dines off its prey				16496.635842931722
he fixed his eyes on that window he distinguished a shadow in the darkness then one of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling				6827.2495997572005
in the meantime there is bread water and fresh straw and that is all a prisoner can wish for				936.6940253798725
come finish your cup of coffee said monte cristo the history is ended chapter				372.85595640076644
i was obliged to pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves				25488.064842116368
really captain groslow you are too much in fortune s way				692.9434478047511
adieu then and be of good courage said athos				12.492594065397439
the queen has not only one son but two then monsieur de coligny was killed and yes said mazarin but the coadjutor is not yet made cardinal no my lord but he will be answered the guard				1782.764323243878
madame de villefort rose monte cristo did the same and the rest followed their example				3145.670880983632
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund				3792.5908732514545
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed				8978.787454286225
oh said aramis i always try to be prepared and then i knew you were seeking me from whom from master bazin to be sure he took you for the devil my dear fellow and hastened to warn me of the danger that threatened my soul if i should meet again a companion so wicked as an officer of musketeers oh monsieur said bazin clasping his hands supplicatingly				95391.52072806303
i detest him				54.97396883903758
come said the count mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary men morrel				1013.0207289898037
he entered and on his way met the waiter				37693.246282364096
and yet he said i must admit that i sent for you to appoint you to quiet service i have certain apprehensions well what is the meaning of that in fact a great noise was heard in the ante chamber at the same time the door of the study was burst open and a man covered with dust rushed into it exclaiming my lord the cardinal				260.3500254961169
now that this marriage which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither m de villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake noirtier s eyes demanded the nature of her mission				4292.612179715154
as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure it is a wound that confines him to his bed ah and a master stroke too i assure you				163.14638811590012
the chief approached and it was indeed planchet d artagnan had recognized the voice of his old servant				1364.9421174766185
i will go i will go d artagnan took the soldier s arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword				1125.5431562974643
she might say that athos had hanged her but then athos would tell that she was branded				12942.34550145024
he was restrained by the threats of the two gentlemen and by the presence of their attendants who doubtless had received their instructions				3833.0174705106097
tis well we will see if the king s name is not a passport everywhere replied the gascon				1055.282797007744
well you said porthos what then i can not wait oh				783.7926560052937
he had no doubt that it was the messenger from albert				1114.6709258097603
indeed said porthos looking complacently at his old lackey as he went away you are right d artagnan mouston will do mouston has a very fine appearance d artagnan smiled				600.6292339736686
in the year i was transferred to piedmont in france				820.0211084504291
yes see i send a ball into the moat a man is there who picks it up the ball contains a letter				745.7051581726107
the king was a few steps behind me when suddenly i saw something rise up in front of me like a huge shadow				3702.8953065934083
but then you yourself are known to others yes i am known so that proceed my dear monsieur cavalcanti so that you will remit to me these francs certainly at your first request the major s eyes dilated with pleasing astonishment				566.9456063140476
the second interview between the former musketeers was not so formal and threatening as the first				1051.7908575669087
as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place				920.934493562275
and why were you alone because you had been arrested edmond and were a prisoner and why was i arrested				2336.589793216483
dantès meanwhile went on his way				676.9992428837412
what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me				123.09305296675035
oh beautiful life				525.9551135910785
the cardinal was as we have said in very low spirits and nothing when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as gaiety in others				692.3872418749792
is it not true aramis said porthos turning toward another musketeer				2129.289640937095
they are aiming they are going to fire they have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the palais royal exclaimed mazarin				873.5779051328321
felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall				1258.3457179258432
then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders and on one of those lovely shoulders round and white d artagnan recognized with inexpressible astonishment the fleur de lis that indelible mark which the hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted				44909.39720712505
how had he discovered her arrival and caused her to be seized				54795.09558407295
the promise it was indeed maximilian morrel who had passed a wretched existence since the previous day				451.90069217706304
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to find their masters				14373.82303095519
monsieur said i does it still displease you that i should frequent a certain house of la rue payenne				86118.99970697374
you tell me of m franz d épinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the idea of being his wife but tell me valentine is there no other sorrow in your heart				407.00318484729183
i think him capable of everything well with the five minutes grace we have only ten left i will profit by them to tell you something about my guest i beg pardon interrupted beauchamp are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us yes and for a most curious one go on then for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning and i must make up for it i was at rome during the last carnival we know that said beauchamp				664.1898704103804
the servant announced m albert de morcerf				1232.9107801418616
planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master s guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill d artagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of d artagnan or rather of planchet after d artagnan had saved his life				547.4304304221538
thousands of men it is true will have to pay for my happiness with their lives but what is that to me provided i see you again				418.9268664218419
the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse yet had he come thought dantès he would have found the treasure and borgia he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing this rock				2116.716579204183
well bring it said athos				10.854768255933799
have my valise carried to the muid d amour rue des bourdonnais				48303.26706520158
we will discuss that subject at length some future time said he				23.17432968543903
with one wave of his hand athos made grimaud who followed the little troop understand everything and they passed on like a whirlwind d artagnan still directing them from behind with his voice				612.111212764141
athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been practicing in a fencing school				42776.736531878036
upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given				2793.2600149431705
the prince was said to be in person at bethune				4154.143280309939
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a door then went forward again				427.7336833519448
i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman that he may be at ease is that all he will know what that means he will guess at least				2328.662561063385
see said he my dear friend how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference by presenting dreadful scenes to their view				6847.391647765746
the aldermen did as they had done before and preceded by their sergeants advanced to receive their illustrious guest				3918.3878782660026
what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed porthos				32.21886211705363
speak out are we threatened with a fresh reign of terror asked another				670.1302109935743
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law				1517.4638839719266
when he drew near to the bedroom door monte cristo expected that he was coming in and raised one of his pistols but he simply heard the sound of the bolts sliding in their copper rings				77372.13551743992
the cardinal who sometimes became weary of the king granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant who promised to return about the fifteenth of september				5074.456946052197
we shall see the windows open and the lady enter by escalade				55826.190264145276
you have guessed rightly				7361.636043841771
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning				3753.342265422585
silence said felton i hear footsteps we are discovered there was a silence of several seconds				4791.1211790073385
although general d épinay served under napoleon did he not still retain royalist sentiments				83531.35045478721
jump directly down close to monsieur de la fere or on the honor of a gentleman i ll kill you monsieur monsieur cried mazarin you are breaking your word to me i did i promise you anything my lord mazarin groaned				2938.6900621445316
and you will add to them this knife said the duke pressing the hand of laporte				5137.564490500069
come let us see them here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the table francs in gold and francs in bank notes				3688.0756886616673
i learn all in the silence of my apartments for instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new piece of music and by thus watching the course of the life of others i learned what had transpired this morning in the house of peers and what was to take place this evening then i wrote then remarked the president the count of monte cristo knows nothing of your present proceedings he is quite unaware of them and i have but one fear which is that he should disapprove of what i have done				1676.0367087206553
oh madame i do not presume to call myself your friend but at all times i am your most respectful servant the countess left with an indescribable pang in her heart and before she had taken ten steps the count saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes				404.3763641869178
you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young man eagerly				3865.829530798186
although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x in who made him a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat pocket but at his button hole ah interrupted morcerf laughing beauchamp beauchamp keep that for the corsaire or the charivari but spare my future father in law before me then turning to monte cristo you just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron i do not know him returned monte cristo but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance for i have a credit opened with him by the house of richard blount of london arstein eskeles of vienna and thomson french at rome as he pronounced the two last names the count glanced at maximilian morrel				712.6124886390432
wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting up				1217.5874203955066
i have formed an acquaintance thanks to my good fortune with many noted persons and have at least for the moment a crowd of friends				586.5802807468222
in fact the blow was direct and severe				36836.4149746101
to imprison him monseigneur				2363.49931301815
aramis on the contrary struck right and left and was almost delirious with excitement				4329.251194846807
there still remained planchet s horse but he stopped short and could not be made to move a step				2249.0788780985076
on the of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the end of the month and that morrel had gone away and left his chief clerk emmanuel and his cashier cocles to meet the creditors				94572.57448812808
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on				620.3779232574242
you ve missed me cried aramis but i swear to heaven				711.958673537743
at the same time monte cristo s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours before whatever you want morrel come to me i have great power more rapidly than thought he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs élysées				2505.331065178873
have you not hit upon any asked danglars				153.60607998997514
then resumed he mad desperate determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything honor and happiness my poor brother returned to lille and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place surrendered himself and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison				1456.219393627013
athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms my dear count when one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money				951.4153209078863
have you not happy rogue that you are have you not your duchess who can not fail to come to your aid well you see my dear d artagnan with what ill luck i play replied porthos with the most careless air in the world				652.6894963581858
nevertheless even in my present state of perturbation i protest that i feel happy				1599.440214900237
he was captured again and conducted to the low and vaulted chamber in which ornano puylaurens and his uncle had died				6986.474190753429
from avignon to marseilles seven francs				736.8782738999845
what is the matter my dear m mouston asked d artagnan				8.640131880789072
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you				158.46588919757613
the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this time at any rate valentine will not die a superhuman joy expanded the old man s eyes which were raised towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude				2224.918716963948
there he is somebody has disturbed him without doubt said d artagnan				5.464616385237304
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry				1770.2669805015666
ma foi said monte cristo rubbing his elbow it s all your servant s fault your stairs are so polished it is like walking on glass are you hurt sir coldly asked morrel				578.3002033280496
now said d artagnan to himself noticing that silent play of countenance i am sure of it i hope the accident has been of no consequence they don t yet know sir on account of the swelling but the doctor is afraid some tendon has been injured at this moment a little boy half peasant half foot boy came to announce supper				1709.6437568436104
do you still wish to dispose of all yes but they will contest the will after your death no my father knows me replied villefort he is quite sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my position i can not plead against the poor the eye of noirtier beamed with triumph				9375.44417052162
well take your hat and gloves returned monte cristo				266.16424958697763
as the door was closed rochefort cast a glance toward mazarin which was answered by one equally furtive from the minister				2660.310285942185
at three o clock the sound of fireworks let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin				9379.736890721297
d artagnan followed him amid cries which strongly resembled curses				55524.02213173092
and yet their natural disposition revealed itself				2624.880928553997
arrived at the bastion the four friends turned round				16934.241439911704
it only remained to put it to the vote when the president resumed gentlemen and you monsieur you will not be displeased i presume to listen to one who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself				325.10670823021644
d artagnan returned				959.8860824846803
and if that were the case it would be worth while to make some sacrifice thank you no sir then it will be tomorrow yes but without fail ah you are laughing at me send tomorrow at twelve and the bank shall be notified i will come myself better still since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you they shook hands				514.0247537487642
some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren				74119.37973770806
her white and slender fingers her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan				58835.3514841218
no it will all go well m d épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m d épinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation				116076.91207677926
that s exactly what my wife said monseigneur do you know who carried off your wife no monseigneur you have suspicions nevertheless yes monseigneur but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to monsieur the commissary and i no longer have them your wife has escaped				5958.224249772936
this time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony i began to feel a devouring hunger				2188.470163158074
the matter was no longer doubtful				22036.235785679648
give it to me said d artagnan who when the gate was open deposited the key in his pocket reckoning upon returning by that gate				1673.5610295381634
arrived at the foot of the back stairs he desired them to wait				4172.104728771074
it is a prison within a prison the walls are double the thickness of the rest				1565.110859099362
stop cried d artagnan giving rein to his famous steed who darting forth overturned several men				870.7528289541962
he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences alleging in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his childhood				88574.786219238
it is impossible said the procureur				105350.4050574946
then d avrigny spoke				7445.600280588483
yes the marechal de grammont is right this will change the aspect of french affairs but i much fear it will do nothing for english even if it does not harm them				123.01724194042444
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition too				1500.4050602123443
the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her				250.90574307005227
noirtier looked at villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride				2872.335128105692
and what was most frightful continued milady her voice altered as if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute was that at this time i retained a consciousness of the danger that threatened me was that my soul if i may say so waked in my sleeping body was that i saw that i heard				1429.2607124712258
she was forced to return to tours she is not faithless she still loves me				119.61438947110356
if i had them i should think myself as rich as croesus then aloud are you ambitious as enceladus well my friend i bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish the shadow of a cloud passed over aramis s face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape d artagnan s observation				4643.4570259429565
this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a million to danglars				456.17179937545984
now continued aramis as the ladies did not see the singer come back and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound through his body it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus and the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock for a time				334.44273454069344
ah ah cried he seizing my arm and wresting from me the weapon that had so badly served me you want to take my life do you my pretty puritan				2719.166226300314
then we must fly said he				10.072459491492802
then that person is a most amiable person albert looked around and perceived franz				877.3366241489407
friend he said you have worked so hard with me toward building up our fortune that at the moment when we are about to reap the fruits of our labours it would be a ridiculous piece of silliness in you to allow yourself to be controlled by aramis whose cunning you know a cunning which we may say between ourselves is not always without egotism or by athos a noble and disinterested man but blase who desiring nothing further for himself doesn t sympathize with the desires of others				683.0303710511251
albert she asked did you notice that what mother that the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of m de morcerf yes but then he breakfasted with me indeed he made his first appearance in the world on that occasion but your house is not m de morcerf s murmured mercédès and since he has been here i have watched him well well he has taken nothing yet the count is very temperate mercédès smiled sadly				3403.062465267223
see the fatal example on the vendomois road d artagnan you so brave and you porthos so valiant and so strong you were beaten to day aramis and i are beaten in our turn				838.8747295719057
after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon				3028.585690778409
you see said lord de winter presenting d artagnan to his sister a young gentleman who has held my life in his hands and who has not abused his advantage although we have been twice enemies although it was i who insulted him and although i am an englishman				1428.8021199920588
one thing alone frightened her that was the remembrance of her husband the comte de la fère whom she had believed dead or at least expatriated and whom she found again in athos the best friend of d artagnan				205.77251434543743
come gentlemen addressing the troop let us return stop exclaimed villequier so mazarin was here				932.0901369436682
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere				6809.556209966417
mordaunt pale and trembling with anger rushed from the hall sword in hand followed by six pikemen pushing inquiring and panting in the crowd and then having found nothing returned				723.2097034574896
at the same time porthos and his adversary fired on each other and d artagnan turned to him				77.1439811682345
i know the world is a drawing room from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of honor paid that is to the purpose				1564.4535042286745
at this moment the accuser concluded with these words the present accusation is preferred by us in the name of the english people at these words there was a murmur along the benches and a second voice not that of a woman but a man s stout and furious thundered behind d artagnan				207.44723416668435
come on here you others he continued rising in his stirrups raising his sword and addressing those musketeers who had not been able to follow his rapid onslaught				57893.813753017406
michon seamstress tours the three friends looked at one another and laughed they were caught				24742.641650653863
all the rest of the square was paved with heads				2939.671119499684
next he went to the quai de feraille to have a new blade put to his sword and then returned toward the louvre inquiring of the first musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel of m de tréville which proved to be in the rue du vieux colombier that is to say in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by d artagnan a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for the success of his journey				1610.1871321496562
here is my pass countersigned said the latter				4697.722194247652
well now he said it seems my dear friend that something vexes you you are ill perhaps				2448.3841506426734
his father was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a count but i do not think he has much claim to that title why said the banker				3396.736550858914
listen how they pull him to pieces even whilst they praise him one takes away from him all claim to good sense another robs him of his poetry a third of his originality another of his humor another of his independence of character a sixth but good heavens				1593.2547293804937
he delayed presenting himself at morrel s but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him				77.46364216539872
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided				50408.601238812065
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch				2070.850209053765
mousqueton had a magnificent livery and enjoyed the satisfaction of which he had been ambitious all his life that of standing behind a gilded carriage				1395.8683485183365
by no means it really seems to me very curious yes indeed				1414.5465300874487
i have made money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded				20599.901486774
if he comes shall we not know it how nothing easier				16844.493691886822
night came and at ten o clock they anchored				54142.56371741761
jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what edmond wanted				3006.579321042204
have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die take courage said grimaud they are gone to find assistance who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud				586.1821184790579
well for my part i a bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to a scaffold in order to have a better view of the king s execution i remain athos turned pale				806.0950103292558
this communication continued the procureur in that cold and decisive tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion will we are sure meet with your approbation the eye of the invalid still retained that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind he listened nothing more				1269.184801779438
at midnight the two travelers were at dammartin but it was then too late to make inquiries the host of the cygne de la croix had gone to bed				905.1664235241236
cloud let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws				20669.465865235416
villefort stood watching breathless until his father had disappeared at the rue bussy				55184.95204156384
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber				891.6618828461359
she should have wanted nothing have you ever seen the queen of england inquired d artagnan				18.92674642628467
my weapons what weapons my military weapons yes my lord at any rate i think so make sure of it and if they want it have them burnished up				1106.764092319425
i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twenty two years ago you know alas and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh				688.3900706409469
what a misfortune it is you did not follow your first vocation what a delicious abbé you would have made oh it s only a temporary postponement replied aramis i shall be one someday				88963.4450850978
for me said d artagnan are you sure of that pardieu monsieur i can t be more sure				3492.192847643623
to this question the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them				135.144349139918
have you any money d artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket				1322.7195532149428
the matter is gallant				63722.625063062456
if they had discovered milady s retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to béthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends				601.0096967266416
in this place were together pouches and barrels the pouches contained of money in gold and the barrels were filled with pounds of gunpowder				12241.05721619557
he calls me his dear monsieur said the mercer to himself				335.2712734865335
why replied dantès i see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words which are rendered illegible by fire yes to you my friend who read them for the first time but not for me who have grown pale over them by many nights study and have reconstructed every phrase completed every thought and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this paper silence exclaimed dantès				545.7214957953381
this is a magnificent habitation said beauchamp looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace				1482.764305676359
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell s tent d artagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle				10304.37684520768
sir cried the latter am i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my house				372.244499721837
i never meddle save with what concerns me and i know how to make believe that i haven t seen what does not concern me but i hate hypocrites and among that number i place musketeers who are abbés and abbés who are musketeers and he added turning to porthos here s a gentleman who s of the same opinion as myself porthos who had not spoken one word answered merely by a word and a gesture				2771.4751171198636
i will make planchet brush my boots and when he has done i will if you like send him to you to brush your shoes he left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate				89523.29096146912
albert soon left her ordered his horses and having arranged his toilet drove to the champs élysées to the house of monte cristo				420.90113649260945
today he said with an effort today the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of noirtier s room where he had seen him the preceding night				1144.5709935928162
i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man				217.77188676027262
interrogate me i entreat you where is your wife in the first place why did not i tell you she had been stolen from me yes but yesterday at five o clock in the afternoon thanks to you she escaped my wife escaped cried bonacieux				3219.5651140061677
from whom asked the gascon				1284.5975284197957
the baroness took advantage of her husband s absence to push open the door of her daughter s study and m andrea who was sitting before the piano with mademoiselle eugénie started up like a jack in the box				1106.4480174605817
so i have a little adventure to propose to you when the count is gone				2576.76006810183
two men wrapped in their cloaks appeared				877.2471025221864
i think the only chance of saving your majesty has just been proposed by monsieur d herblay				3415.0884481596286
i suppose the count has the tastes of the day to be sure returned monte cristo it is very convenient then it is more it is magnificent peste let us not lose such an opportunity returned monte cristo				361.4210909602527
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud very well let us say no more about it				85.99686946424875
let us see said the queen what the count says and she opened the letter and read madame being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand i have commanded my son the count de guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens and that this victory can not fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe				6687.037152570588
his eminence bent his brow stopped for an instant and then kept on his way without uttering a single word				646.0132084584998
athos looked at them both and took their hands in his				1703.2278030767368
we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of wine to your health d artagnan to your health repeated porthos and aramis				293.22259925223244
aramis here cried athos				13.963548990151775
the daily renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long be delayed had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer a service in which he said his soul was in constant jeopardy				40364.08665768109

the road to picardy				20635.11681681555
he was very well known to the customs officers of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first thought that dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade				12098.179209392796
then he added aloud yes sir i am hungry very hungry and your excellency wants something to eat at once if possible nothing easier said peppino				2726.6514059342276
oh more than i can say kitty				899.0830306441964

the rooms had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental ideas the floors were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce the walls hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each chamber luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or convenience of such as sought repose				3079.422646637674
a man of fifty can not long bear malice with a wife of twenty three				6128.860730295948
grimaud thinking that they had come as he had to try the port wine effaced himself behind his cask and consoled himself with the reflection that if he were discovered the crime was not a great one				892.882977681029
the duke smiled				642.6976528332609
the boy triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the money of assunta whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent				14510.921624275934
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement				5950.195026185635
she descended and went through the passage				2254.4216973958437
athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements				5847.340925915272
he did not speak but showed the paper to dantès				691.8766789333364
he asked what was going on				556.0994639554766
you are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom you are charged with having surprised state secrets you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general and who charges me with this monseigneur said d artagnan who had no doubt the accusation came from milady a woman branded by the justice of the country a woman who has espoused one man in france and another in england a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me what do you say monsieur cried the cardinal astonished and of what woman are you speaking thus of milady de winter replied d artagnan yes of milady de winter of whose crimes your eminence is doubtless ignorant since you have honored her with your confidence monsieur said the cardinal if milady de winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge she shall be punished she has been punished monseigneur and who has punished her we she is in prison she is dead dead repeated the cardinal who could not believe what he heard dead				423.6203536285124
on entering the room noirtier s eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room				192.83558975183254
milady who had arisen threw herself quickly into the armchair her head thrown back her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace one hand on her heart and the other hanging down				1420.7602184391367
yes milady replied athos the comte de la fère in person who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit				1530.0183261920045
d artagnan read the letter with apparent calmness and said shaking his head see dear friend what it is to belong to the army				2573.315882633113
listen cried he pity me help me				88.05805821097529

you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom the young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution				6242.760203456883
adieu adieu your holiness said the mendicant opening the door and bending low before the prelate				39096.814508269716
what he asked the cardinal				238.23646730909383
i require honorable guaranties i am sir a living guaranty replied monte cristo motionless but with a threatening look we have both blood in our veins which we wish to shed that is our mutual guaranty				45780.92029786801

bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the bastille				7494.25620013907
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal				320.43426764355416
i only repeat what i have been told and like my informant i can do no more				1185.1270316134546

these citizens are dreadfully ridiculous observed d artagnan to porthos and went on his way				696.411275695812
the prince was therefore contrary to his custom gloomy and anxious when an officer entered and announced to marshal de grammont that some one wished to see him				72.61081019421663
in the meantime d artagnan was defiling with his company				3845.876935128411
the tocsin was sounded				9390.154901338738
you pledge yourself to that marshal added gondy turning to la meilleraie				16660.4474047248
nothing nothing only shut the window				693.5083677584959
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my father and the value of the picture which is as you see one of the best works of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it				87.29187204045971
this room was occupied by dantès father				543.8140395731666

my offers did not arouse him did not even tempt him so much the worse				7531.728800425628
nevertheless whether the passengers were really touched by the urbanity of planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the young man s road our two travelers arrived at chantilly without any accident and alighted at the tavern of great st martin the same at which they had stopped on their first journey				1610.3929149091884
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource				31607.29135947253

he hastened to the side door with ali entered hurriedly and by the servants staircase of which he had the key gained his bedroom without opening or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the house which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant				67054.70675016739
they were his friends and not mine				1303.1947689475717
you are there sir he said respectfully				27705.000790629154
oh ours is a theological quarrel replied aramis making a sign to d artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel				6398.975173860312
the host desired himself to serve him which d artagnan perceiving ordered two glasses to be brought and commenced the following conversation				1410.0775669727016
come come we must be off				1186.088678099044
when he had mounted his phaeton monte cristo turned and seeing bertuccio what news said he				49.680143005918325
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings				64606.839184374134
taste this and in an hour you will be a king not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of europe like france spain or england but king of the world king of the universe king of creation without bowing at the feet of satan you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of the earth				1588.8301795078892
or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another what is that break his arm wound him but do not kill him i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i and you that will be another thing i shall be brought home no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings				19341.761007690766
besides you must have something on the panels of your carriage to escape being searched by the custom house officers				3899.8967914702575
your mother will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam which she had from a bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that do not reach the heart				430.33121006242465

everything considered i am not sorry to retain grimaud he is accustomed to my ways and i am particular				17800.59752767933
here i am smiled porthos with his sublime composure				19106.544103809192
parisians and frondeurs as they were the two friends expected to find the same misery the same fears the same intrigue in the enemy s camp but what was their surprise after passing saint denis to hear that at saint germain people were singing and laughing and leading generally cheerful lives				34460.16701450029
d artagnan had passed himself upon her as de wardes for whom she had conceived one of those tigerlike fancies common to women of her character				2691.918189929145
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself				1077.719589186255
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost				1305.2731824456623
they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year and that franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited italy should act as cicerone to albert				1008.5335389042604
come then said d artagnan you are right				1251.3372036063017
d artagnan whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with had not whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this subject been able to assign any cause for these fits or for the periods of their recurrence				47915.89694956303
the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man if those clothes had not been torn to shreds still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hands of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat				1677.9486774739248
i have worn my cuirass these twenty years kept down in this inferior rank without going forward or backward hardly half living				2278.0384931704784
come come signor pastrini no joking we must have a carriage sir replied the host we will do all in our power to procure you one this is all i can say and when shall we know inquired franz				624.7622978576132
ah ha said he i hope all is over explained and settled yes said beauchamp the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it albert will tell you replied the count that i gave him the same advice				6482.2382358532295
but bear in mind that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the government you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected family alas madame returned villefort my profession as well as the times in which we live compels me to be severe				39387.412058807524
you told me that what matters it to you kitty				1506.8608107510763
you would have been summoned to the gate you would have believed yourself about to meet friends you would have been abducted and conducted back to paris oh my god				445.9478797248085
i thought we agreed for the price i asked that is replied the jeweller i offered francs forty thousand cried la carconte we will not part with it for that sum				7996.659835805201
my mother cried mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint i can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen and whilst d artagnan uttered a cry porthos raised the oar and aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea whilst mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to paralyze his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer				2100.435450431342
they are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty what do you fear vasiliki said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud				16082.4199392841
it may be worn at via reggio but that costume however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in paris that s unfortunate oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave paris but what shall i wear what you find in your trunks in my trunks				58902.66556868267
but although the jeweler had been mentioned first it was the secretary who first made his appearance				1199.863355996568
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince				1110.8611626675067
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word				579.2562080662389
and why asked scarron is he not a man of good birth certainly agreeable undeniably witty he has unfortunately too much wit well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man because he is an enemy of whom of the cardinal what answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man				179.08088955260467
i believe on my soul that they never mean to finish it oh yes they will only listen to that charming finale				66214.23753816502
it was not difficult to understand that he had gained the crown of his ambition and that the silver mounted wand he brandished was in his eyes as honorable a distinction as the marshal s baton which condé threw or did not throw into the enemy s line of battle at fribourg				82069.1245891667
never never i believe you said mme				25.70999472373006
and i asked mazarin after a moment s silence				789.2713303694248
at six in the evening the guests began to come				1279.6448826550654
without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance				2793.6676153106746
uncle and nephew				77479.49742455054
that head has never conspired murmured he but it matters not we will see you are accused of high treason said the cardinal slowly				3309.2344589562063
the bandit gazed on this scene with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him and yet here was one whose gay temperament was not for a moment altered as for franz he was enchanted at the way in which albert had sustained the national honor in the presence of the bandit				6312.427648394415
well penelon said the captain what makes you shake your head why i says i still think you ve got too much on i think you re right answered he we shall have a gale a gale				45391.04621537267

the ground is soaking wet yet i fancy as thou sayest that i see something at this moment the neighing of a horse struck his ear coming through darkness and space				6284.400731778501
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence				1723.3139525665608
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next door to the bell and bottle it had been stated by others that a number of travellers had arrived during the night				1159.3756225685224
at ten o clock the next day they met again				313.9112246415567
but with the rapidity of thought d artagnan seized athos by the waist and followed by porthos with aramis leaped down from the benches rushed into the passages and flying down the staircase were lost in the crowd without while the muskets within were pointed on some three thousand spectators whose piteous cries and noisy alarm stopped the impulse already given to bloodshed				14302.936410360777
he could not help thinking of m rochefort whom he had seen in notre dame could de rochefort have forestalled him with athos				260.8743186246487
the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage but d artagnan whose anger already excited was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos caught at his bridle and stopped him				81.58062359273256
for us also inquired athos				17.96354679313587
in that case we are as well off as we wish and yet said porthos i would like to know what grimaud is about silence porthos said aramis				158.13074693336367
in short what shall i say to you felton continued milady in the tone of a woman accusing herself of a crime				2521.7824032657863
see if the young man with the black doublet and the short hair who was with me just now is still in the palace bernouin went out and soon returned with comminges who was on guard				1858.7835288742665
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m morrel and then ran on to mercédès				1490.3375649546194
the ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage and everyone reconducted his lady to her place but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady to advance eagerly toward the queen				537.5194220207342
he again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first rate esquire after bowing to athos and d artagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted				32350.66568542487
thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model				60929.64568889356
in fact her position was terrible				5863.5014886377885
again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him				77.6806581509566
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris				452.54242493292213
they proposed a game of bouillotte				66574.51956535873
the door of the back staircase opened then the side gate of the garden and ali and his master were on the spot with lights				8215.90611059583
this was a question the young man asked himself whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed being in heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover				5362.210095041329
and the thing was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman albert had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his return he should astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love affairs				1618.707574077091
although athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress				1517.3032570110126
the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair do you really think so				574.3327996903032
she practiced all the evening and then went to bed replied mademoiselle cornélie				141809.7635376556
get your clothes together				637.6639086486742
my dear athos he said i am going away				504.682924037171
i believe while the countess g takes you for lord ruthven my mother imagines you to be cagliostro or the count saint germain				1832.3748371385711
and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked debray				519.7308893977126
then you love me said she				39.63187098434205

well upon my honor said athos your eminence is right in taking us with you we have seen several ill looking faces on the road and we have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces a quarrel and what for gentlemen said the cardinal you know i don t like quarrelers and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of what has happened for you might learn it from others and upon a false account believe us to be in fault what have been the results of your quarrel said the cardinal knitting his brow				1004.2979792600789
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began				2519.938474098745
and you disinherit your granddaughter continued the notary because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes yes so that but for this marriage she would have been your heir yes there was a profound silence				778.438493587004
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme				155.76848558443749
after the two friends had been chatting a few moments a servant from m de tréville entered bringing a sealed packet				39177.65864764064
m noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain				48269.23659089743
do i know said he and do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer				46368.65835880649
and what will that signify to me				103.60868779170801
there was a great murmur of voices which continued to draw near amid which she seemed to hear her own name pronounced				26092.521765119738
besides added he lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal let us give them apparent security that is policy this policy of louis xiii				1062.3688666319883
but could i do with a million retorted the count				204.212463223438
it seemed to explain to him the change in athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence				4844.048212892969
he had passed the night standing and without sleep				1484.9187974493514
seeing d artagnan about to leave her milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the comte de wardes				2673.1202481872074
at that moment he thought of the trees upon whose leaves the light still shone and as one of them drooped over the road he thought that from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion				10406.6695134499
the young girl then continued speaking slowly like a person who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which he is relating				51535.10481254849
if we stay here five minutes more there s an end of us yes you are right but where shall we go asked porthos				124.60147561075364
come hermine he said after a short time answer candidly something vexes you is it not so nothing answered the baroness				1796.1188250108214
my lord answered de chavigny with a low bow i have on the ramparts twenty pieces of artillery and in my casemates thirty thousand guns				7913.813765757847
so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man				203.16321412020088
ha ha said château renaud here come some friends of yours viscount				4346.792305036461
well over that coach house are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments ah diable bells did you say what do you mean oh nothing				568.6063038818095
you are here said she				35.31138411401619
pardon me said he my dear baron but one of my friends the abbé busoni whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in paris not having seen him for a long time i could not make up my mind to leave him sooner so i hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait nay said danglars it is my fault i have chosen my visit at a wrong time and will retire not at all on the contrary be seated but what is the matter with you				146.79450726590952
i pointed to the spot where i had concealed myself				782.1778898342527
but you continued m bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days				932.255044413532
what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures				11361.589710920869
the devil				709.323023768501
come my friends a moment s delay said athos our servants here we are they cried				1276.2610227345378
you see there are two wanting eight days my lord i will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if i can have them by the day after tomorrow my lord they shall be yours you are a jewel of a man mr o reilly but that is not all				567.832476173038
now let me tell you some news eugénie is to be married in a week and in three days there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival				15705.841414500212
and therefore said d artagnan to clip the hope which athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us no on the faith of a cardinal				288.0269319302159
this was the first time morrel had ever so spoken but he said it in a tone of paternal kindness and julie did not dare to disobey				64807.7039761128
pooh replied porthos i am what i am they rode on for an hour till the horses were covered with foam and dust				3185.94883853608
his eyes glittered with delight				2602.969053664287
yes must i leave alone no whom am i to take with me				127.10822524308833
they then summoned their friends who with blaisois mousqueton and grimaud promptly joined them leaving parry behind them who was to take back to london the horses of the gentlemen and of their lackeys which had been sold to the host in settlement of their account with him				75.66147769776413
buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into france as an ambassador he wished to enter it as a conqueror				16370.802630002145
every kind of revenge was practiced upon the duke by the governor in return for the insults of the innocent pistache				17859.107800620313
but these francs here they are and more besides				62200.97736212661
but for d artagnan all aspects were clothed happily all ideas wore a smile all shades were diaphanous				42088.490691706524
ali cried he striking at the same time on the brazen gong				9488.00367245706
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there				756.6505194369097
you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night				1131.321029021024
a terrible idea however rushed into her mind				459.80046231477303
the next day about nine o clock in the morning he landed at st valery				93913.95571760935
oho said they not in bed at a quarter past eleven				9259.600422972371
all this must be prepared against				140838.02542363948
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women				2329.1167560227036
dressed as aramis had been the night before the bishop got into his carriage and the former more disguised by his pallor and sad countenance than his deacon s dress got in by his side				1520.6096618397144
well my friend there is not a moment to lose we must let the king know immediately why what is the matter it would take too long to tell you besides you will hear it all directly and the least word dropped here might ruin all				578.5843007647786
when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair				55134.18892876958
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count s pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting				3759.1454822282612
he glanced around in order to seize on something on which the conversation might turn and seemed to fall easily on a topic				44664.61410083444
oh my god my god i thank thee madame said athos madame in the name of heaven whose empty glass is this mine monsieur said the young woman in a dying voice				608.8131591448711
the same day they came for me and took me to the bastile				6951.17741235263
that s all right said the man hop in and we re off				1189.2141761284222
die in peace i am lost murmured milady in english				2331.295679658296
endure nothing from anyone except monsieur the cardinal and the king				687.1074813563522
then he looked anxiously at valentine				731.0113717901721
here i am in the heart of paris but a moment ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade sellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east not such as i have seen it but such as my dreams have painted it				95.26078287665072
and the coadjutor and madame de longueville and if the worthy broussel were there whom you so stupidly helped arrest i should tell you to excuse yourself to him at once and kiss him on both cheeks well sir i will obey you although i do not understand you it is unnecessary for you to understand				1563.3133018888561
they went the whole length of the garden without uttering a word				684.9543461674008
faithful friend noble heart said the king i should not have been rescued				90204.4381323183
then you have thought that barrois was poisoned yes do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him no do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now attacked valentine yes then will she die too asked d avrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on noirtier				1771.9585787395104
on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady and bound her hands and feet				964.2759107299227
i will have him come in if you really wish it athos moved toward the door the duchess held him back				1248.677034164077
danglars is his banker is he not asked château renaud of debray				1071.0396771395247
presently the army came in sight of lens two or three houses were in flames and a dull noise was heard which indicated what suffering was endured by a town taken by assault				61777.69671422453
vicomte come here said athos the duchess permits you to kiss her hand the youth approached with his charming smile and his head bare and kneeling down kissed the hand of the duchess de chevreuse				2647.2208696842154
i was replied the procureur you begged me not to leave did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which madame de saint méran has fallen a victim i did				3147.9966981641705
when he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges of my innocence				3854.483673099436
i have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer				4628.681053942927
albert had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the guests at a breakfast of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling				9074.52155825349
ah yes it is indeed strange and the wretched family departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the evening				568.6551098468386
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming visits the bright pure gleam of heavenly happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole countenance with a look of ineffable joy and calmness as immediately after villefort s departure his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his mind				507.901994906619
it might be a vengeance of milady that was most probable				78003.88946944427
and the queen what queen madame henrietta of england daughter of henry iv she is at the louvre as you know yes and i hear in bitter poverty				33393.95137199537
porthos boasted of the strength of mousqueton who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size				21522.03105780089
bonacieux who was charged with going to fetch the duke and conducting him to the louvre was abducted				15064.025082719862
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinal s arm				1179.6265970253364
athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his finger but arriving at four crossroads he stopped again visibly embarrassed				19181.32500306976
i tell you that you know these things as well as i do since this gentleman has forewarned you both as a doctor and as a friend oh you rave sir exclaimed villefort in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken				1680.5141836733035
i will give it to none but the king monsieur said anne				8447.807474305397
he had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason and now these few words uttered by faria after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation				45182.18611597592
but that is not all after rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like st martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with me guess what a strasbourg pie asked beauchamp				665.8315056297429
no replied d artagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way ah you surprise me				98.86051781025398
could the prisoners see each other he asked				939.5690514525805
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and d avrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to say he is mad but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight				3783.1625122515998
my hand said she				31.64569883339173
we shall then be matched four against the remaining five				6381.983895739447
everything in her mind was lost for an instant when all at once she perceived that no signature was attached to the order				3256.851582137068
i thought i did not mistake				2937.7583609210164
if you die i will die with you that is all i can say to you silence cried felton we are here in fact they touched the sloop				4821.427978146872
there are situations which the heart of a father or a mother can not be made to understand				1676.0303151602002
remember the soldiers and sentinels who guard these doors				2118.7523650542475
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages				26304.366588752717
and the other one demanded the count				258.4857494892623
the confidence with which d artagnan spoke convinced patrick which was the name of this minister of the minister				2727.8309139973207
morrel overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every vein				13031.643617997204
well never mind how it is answered albert it comes to the same thing in the end				902.3828980954576
there are the horses				1828.7297109052895
he went to him				64.37155853395633
ah s blood how you have hurt me				68.08880421742758
the cardinal was left free to carry on the siege without having at least at the present anything to fear on the part of the english				2327.1473679994565
it is true however that it was the shorter and easier part				5412.7822380021735
that s his province ay ay said porthos pass the pen to aramis who writes theses in latin well so be it said d artagnan				52.66310469163652
this immediately recalled to d artagnan s mind the handkerchief which he had found at the feet of mme				225.33168043399326
when he reached the threshold of the door the prisoner stopped				1195.1980701461555
in the meantime my dear lucien here are cigars contraband of course try them and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves peste i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them execrable				54878.246724695215
there is the little door opening into the garden				1373.3745023648341
athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly				81895.55517068793
i am your prisoner said aramis giving up his sword to porthos				329.9385174331733
arrived in london you will seek buckingham i must beg your eminence to observe said milady that since the affair of the diamond studs about which the duke always suspected me his grace distrusts me well this time said the cardinal it is not necessary to steal his confidence but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator frankly and loyally repeated milady with an unspeakable expression of duplicity				61038.11174555034
ah it is you my lord said he				10.957097471690181
touches upon the strange effects a half pistole may have				1921.5919675645207
porthos impatient at his continued losses kept up a vigorous play with his knee				6296.08047166654
let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of france				787.4770358444345
you a frondeur on my word of honor said athos one must be either a mazarinist or a frondeur				18936.064309974125
now said he the sacrifice is consummated				75110.60167551141
and he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood				50195.98961939359
well be assured added he with the familiarity of a gascon you shall not wait long and he bowed in order to retire and as if he considered the future in his own hands				526.9245760363848
but supplicants for favor know how to accommodate the expression of their features and the daughter of henry iv				1285.7588235847688
it was the marquis de saint méran				2495.6160645602044
teresa felt a flush pass over her face she looked at luigi who could not refuse his assent				1630.3705125677288
he is a charming fellow i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he madame danglars was rooted to the spot she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a chair thinking of villefort of the dinner scene of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate				48947.981564719565
bonacieux at home chapter xviii				1957.528001908089
it vexes me greatly continued athos that you attach so much importance to these animals for i am not yet at the end of my story what else have you done after having lost my own horse nine against ten see how near i formed an idea of staking yours yes but you stopped at the idea i hope no for i put it in execution that very minute and the consequence said d artagnan in great anxiety				891.8978875961059
only imagine me a captain at twenty with a hundred louis pay and a share in the profits				39993.48266712103
he was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis				5491.230008242813
this new eruption was more dangerous than the others being composed of armed men				965.1540734919791
the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground				1580.8227553800248
follow me said an officer who came up behind the guards				1377.7048061756907
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect				8455.03720813277
monte cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command courage haydée dried her eyes and continued by this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pasha it was a friend				807.8273300624222
pray d artagnan said athos after a minute either take off that ring or turn the mounting inside it recalls such cruel recollections that i shall have no head to converse with you				184.82923670520663
oh it would be a sacrilege				51342.56065481234
i will be with you directly the young men rose and returned into the salon while the count again apologizing left by another door				335.6809501411514
this reasoning seemed to d artagnan so satisfactory that he no further insisted and about eight o clock in the evening the time when the vapors of night begin to thicken in the streets he left the hotel de la chevrette and followed by planchet set forth from the capital by way of the saint denis gate				1662.9595899059473
nevertheless time passed on and the rochellais did not surrender				23351.764102439898
all these proofs of an energetic resolution which albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother				1618.8588656910829
d artagnan meantime went into the house whistling a tune which he had begun before porthos went away				582.1809061498725
but here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards danglars who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp				3805.6050434419885
valentine had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm then trembling agitated and her heart beating with indescribable terror she awaited the event				4303.425098559285
i never had one				762.4417466965457
endeavor to remember the names of those faithful servants who crossed the channel in spite of monsieur de richelieu tracking the roads along which they passed by their blood to bring back to your majesty certain jewels given by you to buckingham anne arose full of majesty and as if touched by a spring and looking at the cardinal with the haughty dignity which in the days of her youth had made her so powerful you are insulting me she said				526.225038188456
perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such thoughts perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word on which his sense of honor was keen kept him from referring in any way to the possibilities of flight				3214.7665620291727
but hark				7840.681769400137
he was therefore silent and as athos was the least inquisitive of any man on earth d artagnan s confidence stopped there				922.9338502949388
the woman kneels on a prie dieu of painted wood and at a short distance from her stands the young girl leaning against a chair weeping				6309.953913178566
on his return home the coadjutor was informed that a young man had come in after his departure and was waiting for him he started with delight when on demanding the name of this young man he learned that it was louvieres				50955.25407524597
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller				12941.197673580014
i had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock and in the light of the sun its black arms bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without emotion that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message				7535.723505285215
now to supper said aramis				20.009754375409926
grimaud nevertheless was resolved for certain reasons not at once to come to a full rupture with the prisoner he wanted to inspire not a sudden repugnance but a good sound steady hatred he retired therefore and gave place to four guards who having breakfasted could attend on the prisoner				1306.772165939318
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated				13361.332270489513
did i tell you that i wouldn t serve any other				989.372952892708
now as you are one of the whole world i mean to say that you also are deserting me cardinal heavens				1731.14479590068
this coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified milady whose questions became more pressing				46915.9533057843
he felt that in returning to camp he should re enter slavery nevertheless he did return				838.9739370849629
the first sight that attracted the eyes of spada was that of his nephew in full costume and cæsar borgia paying him most marked attentions				33722.3049179407
let us alight here said athos				12.117582735447323
dantès reviewed his past life with composure and looking forward with terror to his future existence chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge				12510.198479394616
the chevalier murmured charles				2912.1707746399843
that s the whole story				1550.2498323549946

for the pleasure of a meeting with you i would go to the end of the world very well to morrow sir i shall rely on it				89.18068516520296
very well sir said monte cristo				90.9624719495223
the room was whitewashed as is the custom in prisons but it looked quite brilliant to a prisoner though a stove a bed a chair and a table formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture				5375.599375939289

at last said aramis we are ready are we yes monsieur quite ready said bazin but it took me some time to bring up all the because you always think you have on your shoulders your beadle s robe and spend all your time reading your breviary				9171.932407730133
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the steps at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the door of the room				199.61824068726574
oh do not say so it will break my resolutions but not mine mother replied albert				264.2301156145573

my lord said comminges who irritated by his wounds wished for revenge and longed to give back blow for blow shall i fire off a ball to punish that jester and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune in the future and as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle s saddle bow				2389.8513683336614
it was mordaunt				1807.2675150742168
well monsieur de busigny i will bet you said athos that my three companions messieurs porthos aramis and d artagnan and myself will go and breakfast in the bastion st gervais and we will remain there an hour by the watch whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us porthos and aramis looked at each other they began to comprehend				3131.4324617423204
two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire furniture				5430.817383095527
halloo cried jussac advancing toward them and making a sign to his men to do so likewise halloo musketeers				1253.9372668956246
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart				405.6212048611772
when mordaunt finds himself discovered he will destroy all friends and foes and on my word he would be bad company in going either to heaven or to hell you have some plan then asked athos				165.4140696335477
now then she said what next madame my friend du vallon is rich and has therefore nothing in the way of fortune to desire but i think i remember that there was a question between him and monsieur mazarin as to making his estate a barony				22012.41721285713
athos sighed deeply				2652.7276635160274
ah said porthos what a fearful day my dear d artagnan what				402.6934574568438
he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly				6994.580880712773
still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de morcerf s				1098.5785586226796
under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance really captain said d artagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french				3169.8166425852123
however we have them safe in prison and they are just sufficiently culpable for us to keep them in prison as long as we find it convenient				24708.68612391856
during all this time a sentinel who had been relieved at eight o clock had been watching his door				335.6831910607359
he went and resumed his post beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and this solitude				32043.337136706552
lord de winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty third and it was now the morning of the twenty second				1331.2662064231974
i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure then turning around and seeing that morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuel s hand significantly watch over him why so asked the young man surprised				4944.461829954096
d artagnan seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard				2614.000498690525
i adopt all customs speak all languages				72858.45051366757
but that which astonished him most was that the cardinal so deeply interested in preventing this young man from setting his foot in england had not succeeded in arresting him on the road				2696.558572040902
the cardinal exaggerated as i perceive but pray sir continued aramis who seeing his captain become appeased ventured to risk a prayer do not say that athos is wounded				2552.205614232867
my dear m d artagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands he paused				3232.4281530752596
d artagnan put the gold in his hat and in going back to the chateau settled the reckoning with porthos each of them had cleared two hundred and fifteen louis				5518.623968957287
when the soldier saluted charles athos s heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket				1307.3436896537137
monsieur du vallon and i are the only two who are armed				27552.651825045035
why i ll wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules and without staggering too done said danglars i ll take your bet but tomorrow today it is time to return				883.916248056315

the sentinel who was relieved at six o clock in the morning remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young man arrived on horseback with a little boy before him				79.14473667255955
and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the father in law i must address myself to the banker and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his turn				733.9697585229052
monsieur d artagnan made a compact with you and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond reach m				591.9806053643207
de winter dismounted at his hotel and went up into his apartment intending to watch the spy but as he was about to place his gloves and hat on a table he saw reflected in a glass opposite to him a figure which stood on the threshold of the room				201.10224443138762
read and answer or i will blow out your brains the sergeant saw that d artagnan was in earnest				24899.62905156832
do you want money				809.488486260599
her countenance with surprising mobility had recovered its gracious expression but some little red spots on her handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood came				1432.8261183061627
the queen				550.4865148716808
a double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet				995.1922969485103
i go he said only shall i enter the chamber where those gentlemen are no it is not worth while well do me the kindness to take my purse which i left on the mantelpiece all right he then proceeded with his usual calm gait to the stable and went into the very midst of the soldiery who foreigner as he was could not help admiring his height and the enormous strength of his great limbs				14922.682723432164
now if you marry m cavalcanti and i get the three millions or even if it is thought i am going to get them my credit will be restored and my fortune which for the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality will revive				54961.3143853651
the one i have hired for you where will it take me where you please after you have put me on shore at portsmouth what are you going to do at portsmouth asked milady				614.4879023252722
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat				2435.394318688961
it was only on the following day at about ten o clock in the morning as he was starting to call on m deschamps the notary that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from valentine although he had not before seen her writing				5097.957990651593
six days				951.3118897298892
as soon as his engagement with the patron of la jeune amélie ended he would hire a small vessel on his own account for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres and under some pretext land at the island of monte cristo				437.3741858337685
sire it is something more opaque than the fog indeed said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed athos				181.32191557585764
i will have three fleur de lis embroidered on it in gold and will give it to your company as a standard monseigneur said m de tréville that will be unjust to the guardsmen				83470.51107997408
are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of death or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred				77343.65866126612
i was still unable to divine for what reason m de villefort had this spade in his hands when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the earth				1534.9779360523717
he held the knife with which milady had stabbed herself open in his bosom at one bound he was upon the duke				1163.1237974565527
i must know what you mean to do said she				33.90799694428363
he was a relentless enemy that damned cardinal continued aramis glancing at the portrait of the old minister				2672.4473213650663
i remember now milady looked around her as if in search of something				3108.7855145964445
at the mention of monte cristo dantès started with joy he rose to conceal his emotion and took a turn around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca				51962.93234901288
you are madame s brother i learn be it so but fortunately you are not mine it might be thought that milady timid as women are in general would have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to prevent the quarrel from going too far but on the contrary she threw herself back in her carriage and called out coolly to the coachman go on home the pretty soubrette cast an anxious glance at d artagnan whose good looks seemed to have made an impression on her				228.59993278605845
does he regret me a little				1354.378176005694
grimaud s agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news				2453.04215334494
the groom in obedience to his orders tapped at the window of the porter s lodge saying pray does not the count of monte cristo live here his excellency does reside here replied the concierge but added he glancing an inquiring look at ali				3025.658386026308
god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when he at length issued from his tomb enriched him with gold and diamonds and led him to you ah i recognize you i recognize you exclaimed the king s attorney you are i am edmond dantès you are edmond dantès cried villefort seizing the count by the wrist then come here and up the stairs he dragged monte cristo who ignorant of what had happened followed him in astonishment foreseeing some new catastrophe				12081.29976933572
the house to which d artagnan and porthos conducted athos and aramis was the one assigned to them by general cromwell and of which they had taken possession on the previous evening				548.110326830478
the movement was executed in silence and with precision				16664.70610466257
every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine and extraordinary as it seemed each day found him less uneasy				2483.0374153568173
he had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the conference he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover patch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that valentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at liberty				1653.1456388834533
it appears said the baron seating himself in the armchair opposite that occupied by milady and stretching out his legs carelessly upon the hearth it appears we have made a little apostasy what do you mean sir i mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion				17764.068814280392
perhaps never in her life had this woman who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions felt her heart beat so violently				2531.5811575597627
as to d artagnan he fought purely and simply on the defensive and when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued with a vigorous side thrust sent his sword flying				59394.43161736542
the guard obeyed				1576.556765395438
the garden was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the corners were clumps of trees with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers				2263.2819475196675
his agitated features presented the appearance of pale and hideous terror				1033.5072619001455
adieu your excellency depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you saying these words the transteverin disappeared down the staircase while his companion muffling his features more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to franz and descended to the arena by an outward flight of steps				1449.9163037734766
i see my lord i am to be taken back to the bastile you are sagacious i shall return thither my lord but it is a mistake on your part not to employ me you				173.882874749416
her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess her eyes which cast the brilliancy of emeralds were perfectly beautiful and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and majesty				3928.846350844149
are you not a sportsman and a great wolf hunter				43650.64389070846
then he had been seized upon by danglars who with a rapid glance at the stiff necked old major and his modest son and taking into consideration the hospitality of the count made up his mind that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir				3494.2449857726733
decidedly you are a brave fellow said athos pressing the young man s hand				297.15444312327315
i have replied d artagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table				694.358101265441
what horses asked athos				11.867858735248793
pâtés made by the successor of father marteau are described				10695.255016563988
but continued m de tréville fixing upon his compatriot a look so piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his heart on account of my old companion your father as i have said i will do something for you young man				140.6370208600164
a red handkerchief encircled his gray head torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man s shoulder and which was the first thing andrea saw seemed of gigantic size				21891.893530245598
as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied maximilian				2130.1670619679157
paris now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that letter why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone assuring me he so advised me for my own interest and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the address noirtier repeated the abbé noirtier i knew a person of that name at the court of the queen of etruria a noirtier who had been a girondin during the revolution				121921.77268860287
no replied athos and he oh he				284.9374949471516
porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and contemplative organization and he had brought him away without any other recommendation				31508.486442490786
emmanuel julie farewell how farewell exclaimed julie do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport needless delays but increase the grief of parting said monte cristo and maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything requisite at least i advised him to do so i have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said morrel in his tranquil but mournful manner				935.9926001729337
but such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal such as is my supper it is yours to share if you will				1757.8932887580083
he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs he was drawn by four good horses at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a distance of seven leagues				8953.041728383245
well after all said d artagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we have seen many other such				12336.39440018255
albert recognized the bearer				5044.353704417735
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting room ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the orders of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress s wishes to the three other waiting women the latter had received most peremptory instructions from monte cristo to treat haydée with all the deference they would observe to a queen				522.0843627565299
danglars watched these preparations and his mouth watered				56628.099422694555
will your excellency deign to open it said the delighted bertuccio and you will find gloves in it elsewhere the count found everything he required smelling bottles cigars knick knacks				102625.6473761919
another person was confined in the château at the same time but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad priest ah indeed mad repeated monte cristo and what was his mania he offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty monte cristo raised his eyes but he could not see the heavens there was a stone veil between him and the firmament				79021.35802897449
he was dressed in a doublet and hose of a violet color with aiguillettes of the same color without any other ornaments than the customary slashes through which the shirt appeared				922.756071400977
the cardinal would reply with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic strong at once by power and genius you should not have allowed yourself to be taken then milady collected all her energies murmuring in the depths of her soul the name of felton the only beam of light that penetrated to her in the hell into which she had fallen and like a serpent which folds and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength she enveloped felton beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination				2911.9347168976224
she looked at him in amazement				1478.6162755058779
cardinal i must have the queen s papers but how to take them sire				3920.9447283716713
and you believe he died of hunger sir of hunger said caderousse				189.08254869791267
the monk exclaimed grimaud				39.161508180622896
your d artagnan				29.344890500073433
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together				660.9262962096118
faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther corner of his cell				2634.229771192409
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues				16975.845773131256
certainly his panegyric has been uttered they parted laughing she turning back to gaze at the poor paralytic man with interest he looking after her with eyes of love				1564.5325811208065
but this is tyranny cried one of them in very good french though with a foreign accent that this madman will not allow these good people access to their own wine				1134.8491660892817
in fact a moment later m morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the pharaon who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship and as dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own				759.8800494291621
i saw amid the shadows the table sink through the floor a quarter of an hour later it reappeared bearing my supper				1626.8673343855426

one of his guns was swung over his shoulder gaetano had the other and a sailor held his rifle his dress half artist half dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude				15629.786824967543
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying you promise sir that s agreed that i shall find you to morrow at charenton oh don t be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre				9362.809946914102
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around				2899.0030829755333
albert sprang from the porter s lodge to the steps				1576.2267769229709
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton				305.4842061520016
they look like shipwrecked sailors who have not eaten for six weeks m coquenard entered pushed along upon his armchair with casters by mme				208.135660019374
when the two were ready to go out the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon and prepared to follow his master				1397.3201150813547
major bartolomeo cavalcanti and count andrea cavalcanti announced baptistin				2094.76723964407

but continued the queen you have doubtless come for some important purpose				1660.0488019160885

when madame de villefort pronounced the name of franz the pupil of m noirtier s eye began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning glance at madame de villefort and his son				753.7211042700611
she entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the count s attention				2098.35923004828

hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man i am d artagnan don t you know me				78.33334372646343
two long hours he waited in terrible inaction				68861.17190660987
bonacieux and that the man was aramis				356.254258016301
the young man advanced rapidly into the chamber leaving the door open behind him and making a sign to milady to be silent his face was much agitated				3392.537671834343
well said he do you still doubt oh murmured the young girl				991.6499712756171

he will explain to you the steps that i expect you to pursue				78431.38749559922
go sir said the queen with her most bewitching smile go and return at midnight and d artagnan retired but as he passed out he glanced at the curtain through which the queen had entered and at the bottom of the tapestry he remarked the tip of a velvet slipper				66424.72399476798
a frondeur				17789.95677446614
oh my dear d artagnan resumed aramis giving to his voice a slight tone of bitterness trust me				116.90354594925772
he had his musketeers therefore as louis xiii				1031.9102990154151
i suffered frightful torments				78095.36875487305
mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne horse small but very handsome				6770.134686899328

project gutenberg is a registered trademark				1726.1891518989119
yes sir you have not been long detained no				340.47747425812446
athos approached and hung over the youth in an attitude full of tender melancholy he looked long on this young man whose smiling mouth and half closed eyes bespoke soft dreams and lightest slumber as if his guardian angel watched over him with solicitude and affection				5664.886625065308
my son				710.541703139779

if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up				1233.3923623657638
then he raised his eyes towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that other judge named god				535.6299071914578
i went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking tenderly at a lady and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the second couplet				70630.23466834832
he bowed with great friendship to the count				292.9442111815076
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting				41437.07559944017
yes appearances were against me and i was about to suffer dishonor				11033.201476987373

then you will lie here said d artagnan				7.464851270966232
i had provided myself with a dark lantern				5923.45440297687
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over				1865.1245393776767
well said beauchamp what still oppresses you my friend i am broken hearted said albert				313.7718992662952
a man has carried off your mistress a man has seduced your wife a man has dishonored your daughter he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to expect from heaven that portion of happiness god has promised to everyone of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head or pass a sword through the breast of that man who has planted madness in your brain and despair in your heart				424.0405155439777
charles was perceived through the door lying dressed upon his bed at the head of which parry was seated reading in a low voice a chapter from the bible				71926.85094648457
the villefort family vault chapter				267.333813555631
i will say two words about it to the cardinal s esquire likewise				10788.518186139772
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion but what are we going to do there you know well that we go to breakfast there but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you				133.48455099914017
in your case it would be a crime				2519.0506479128903
two persons passed near me allow me to conceal their names for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single word this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering morrel oh yes very gloomy my friend				753.6718677728743
we have a king ten years old who doesn t yet know what he wants we have a queen blinded by a belated passion we have a minister who governs france as he would govern a great farm that is to say intent only on turning out all the gold he can by the exercise of italian cunning and invention we have princes who set up a personal and egotistic opposition who will draw from mazarin s hands only a few ingots of gold or some shreds of power granted as bribes				65996.10962653601
then walking towards morrel he took his hand the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a profound stupor				46502.308368005884
her hands clutched her armchair she ground her teeth inwardly her eyes followed the motion of the door as it closed behind lord de winter and felton and the moment she was alone a fresh fit of despair seized her				251.2866104488266
but why did she return to tours without telling me anything because she was in fear of being arrested why has she not written to me then because she was afraid of compromising you d artagnan you restore me to life cried aramis				213.51265359314547

what are you doing asked rochefort				642.0966553259874
if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves for my fortune is theirs before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude				58704.089059977916
they soon tired of the sport				45754.382658899325
eh rascal said d artagnan do you not recognize his highness the prince s carriage prince or not said the man open				984.2463493047
the room was inundated with blood dripping from the mattresses upon which lay the wounded man speechless the monk had disappeared				1276.866692239835

now if i had taken the veil all this fortune would have descended to my father and in reversion to his son ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should be so avaricious it is not for herself that she is so but for her son and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of maternal love but could you not compromise matters and give up a portion of your fortune to her son how could i make such a proposition especially to a woman who always professes to be so entirely disinterested valentine i have always regarded our love in the light of something sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul				7499.0891836941155

but though he held the cardinal s promises as of little worth he affected to be completely satisfied for he was unwilling to discourage porthos				243.60748497726243
villefort fully understood his father s meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders				1290.0318412308459
god is always the last resource				32958.411407646294
habitually he spoke little and slowly bowed frequently laughed without noise showing his teeth which were fine and of which as the rest of his person he appeared to take great care				1850.6973886448736
this woman exercised over him an unaccountable power he hated and adored her at the same time				353.33053693430935
know then what i thought i had already told you that in participation in this world s affairs more especially in their moral aspects the count of monte cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east				11940.309230813857
turn chartreux or trappist and relate your secrets but as for me i do not like anyone who is alarmed by such phantasms and i do not choose that my servants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening				521.4133782452485
who is this groslow asked porthos				207.2079893409545

formerly he would have approached the queen as a young man who bends before a woman but now it was a different thing he answered her summons as an humble soldier obeys an illustrious general				5487.832347395462
yes indeed that s the right thing				1566.8746198852614
no madame they struck me always struck me				92.02316760368703
but what can they intend to do with the poor creature and how shall i ever meet her again friend said athos gravely remember that it is the dead alone with whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth				1508.8819450363599
at once dantès resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic companion and to remember that what has once been done may be done again				428.15057526108166
against calumniators said m de tréville				690.6169016252535
i thought so but we will return to my lord duke presently				18956.427561769175
but his temper cooled down like his friend s he not only gets used to his captivity but jokes about it so much the better said athos				144.25332691069423
he rose and took a few steps as if to rouse himself from his torpor and went as far as the window he saw glittering below him the muskets of the guards				1344.7568902201472
well then resumed faria with a bitter smile let me answer your question in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad prisoner of the château d if for many years permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and despair dantès remained for a short time mute and motionless at length he said then you abandon all hope of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve nay be not discouraged				69932.03770932776
surely said albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the countess g and who is the countess g inquired château renaud				996.1684391989508

mousqueton collected a store of crusts bazin who had always been inclined to devotion never quit the churches planchet watched the flight of flies and grimaud whom the general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master heaved sighs enough to soften the stones				5288.54003326223
alas i have them no longer how is it that you have no friends in your prosperity when you had many in adversity it is because in my prosperity i forgot those old friends monsieur because i have acted like queen marie de medicis who returning from her first exile treated with contempt all those who had suffered for her and being proscribed a second time died at cologne abandoned by every one even by her own son well let us see said mazarin isn t there still time to repair the evil				6707.71862188337
without doubt she murmured				2527.3198800894406
i thought i was right in believing that cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow				3313.703117044849
he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble one				923.7911017539121
ah said the count watching andrea s countenance i do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your father was sent for from lucca				151280.54817495894
the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind				508.91000551165126
his lackey who by an unforeseen piece of ill luck had quarreled with the officers disguised as stable lads miserable scoundrel cried d artagnan you were all in the plot then				769.0800092444055
hush he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee the sergeant began to laugh				2537.1970124234217
it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her				245.0010912937282
as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by d artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over				1871.9503915829612
listen d artagnan				9.54181444247382
it is not here he cried				1259.6040011050716
soubrette and mistress meantime as we have said despite the cries of his conscience and the wise counsels of athos d artagnan became hourly more in love with milady				790.7766742634764
it is then a service which you propose to render us count asked anne of austria after a moment s silence				825.2566488654422
what had you to revenge on the marquis de saint méran oh it was not on him monsieur it was on another this is strange returned monte cristo seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse monsieur said the steward it is fatality i am sure				3728.4618991430425
thus the house had become unrecognizable and bertuccio himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of trees				2143.2604488788115
athos muttered d artagnan you think of every one you are indeed a nobleman				12527.736893895668
come forget him for a moment and instead of pursuing him let him go you are too late madame the orders are issued well should he be arrested do they think they will arrest him i hope so if they should arrest him i know that sometimes prisons afford means of escape will you leave him in prison the procureur shook his head				503.7161911537231
as for andrea he was launched and when he was once launched nothing stopped him				72.34269705154156
ah cursed basilisk it will be a happy day for me when i can cross something more than a look with you the king is really very handsome said porthos and look too though he is a prisoner how carefully he is dressed				61718.1026841827
i had an affianced husband a man whom i loved and who loved me a heart like yours felton a man like you				176.8486707314215
well happily i don t say nay to it				86.17337832152455
five minutes after m de tréville was asking d artagnan what he could do to serve him and what caused his visit at so late an hour				1514.9392340558686
come with us said albert				169.8227310691198
good evening maximilian i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay yes i recognized mademoiselle danglars				450.83466402533764
mother nanette began by picking up the louis then she picked up friquet				4441.114599253919
maximilian said he are your affections disengaged morrel looked at monte cristo with astonishment				675.1310925760479
two hours thus glided away				571.771880123469
i have pledged my last jewels sold your clothes and my own to pay his servants who refused to accompany him unless i made this sacrifice				15233.90769391629
at the end of a year dantès was a new man				249.90312465136222
go the valet bowed and retired and albert returned to his inventory				43363.192306739045
he s not a guest like the other one here just now observed mine host to olivain who had rejoined his master to see if he wanted anything and your young master has no appetite my master had appetite enough three days ago but what can one do				1024.7991593100633
he arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation				8751.885657416955
come athos and aramis go to the right porthos come with me to the left these gentlemen should file off into normandy whilst we by the nearest road reach paris he then gave his friends minute directions as to their route				4168.254999403099
i have no design upon your count and you shall have him all to yourself				1678.0734990079122
besides said aramis god desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner amen said athos and we will return to that subject later if such be your pleasure but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly and i am sure you will understand me d artagnan was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us but this creature must be a demon said porthos holding out his plate to aramis who was cutting up a fowl				7700.491671374683
on entering the court of his hôtel buckingham sprang from his horse and without thinking what became of the animal threw the bridle on his neck and sprang toward the vestibule				15636.242337221709
the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening				562.4735187405377
everything count said albert in a low tone to monte cristo do allow the signora to tell me something of her history				11652.38304402544
i think it does indeed cried the gascon who reckoned upon this letter for making his way at court				1227.003671184132
fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome fate				2422.035650971799
the two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of père lachaise where m de villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his family				4045.2391261154253
what is the matter monsieur said planchet				258.1274474803905
in fact said mordaunt with a calm voice and immovable countenance a single blow sufficed perhaps it was some one in that occupation said cromwell				2043.8372869744906
we lived together we loved we hated together we shed we mingled our blood together and too probably i may still add that there may be yet a bond between us closer even than that of friendship perhaps there may be the bond of crime for we four we once did condemn judge and slay a human being whom we had not any right to cut off from this world although apparently fitter for hell than for this life				537.3151823734908
this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall is i assure you a most agreeable surprise				1950.8505142496842
i recognized your name in it				85.87713189855616
but the young man had begun to follow or rather to advance before the boat				1537.272800651579
raoul has no fortune other than i possess poor child				1034.8007234943566
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart				408.3100395992693
i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the ministers of the occult sciences until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination				3168.187678993584
you see edmond i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my son and who told you madame that i have any hostile intentions against your son no one in truth but a mother has twofold sight				3188.3348422476447
a propos inform bazin will bazin go with us asked aramis				44.13844203777737
well asked anne of austria when d artagnan reappeared what does it mean it means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the palais royal oh this time it is too much exclaimed the queen and i will prove to them i have not left d artagnan saw from the expression of the queen s face that she was about to issue some violent command				4488.625269569867
well what do you propose to do she said at length come speak i will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament with which you are at war is it not so				520.257540598124
i understand you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject				1867.9815731743872
holà bazin come here this minute bazin appeared on the threshold dull and spiritless				31825.91805997796
let us be on our guard oh				850.6658224712271
those casks which i took for casks of port wine are filled with powder				14792.693517717667
it is likely he replied that we shall soon be obliged to separate unless you love me well enough to follow me to italy why cried the queen how is that because as they say in the opera of thisbe the whole world conspires to break our bonds you jest sir answered the queen endeavoring to assume something of her former dignity				2953.5544369700356
he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to spread and restore m de morcerf to the position he had long held in public opinion				5464.248210742176
he beat a retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him threateningly				67178.24072170668
besides it is important added he in a low tone that i should remain in paris just now to watch the paper ah you are a good and an excellent friend said albert yes you are right watch watch beauchamp and try to discover the enemy who made this disclosure albert and beauchamp parted the last pressure of their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger				1644.0722876797524
a family affair athos had invented the phrase family affair				1746.7951147154415
for instance the former servingman of some brave gentleman an enemy himself to mazarin as every gentleman ought to be hush				7019.740651622079
the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill				7703.003647307896
villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration				1679.902077827997
listen captain baldi there s one way of settling this said jacopo				7035.617960653309
the overture to the second act began and at the first sound of the leader s bow across his violin franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek girl who turned around to say a few words to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her box she became as absorbed as before in what was going on				689.8819397289539
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousin s with a face made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required				19156.82839120904
the decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the floor				1467.3397697243895
at half past one they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than ever and which gained them the applause of franz and albert				972.7275813637433
ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better this exclamation which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder				2754.176158852179
and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant general the count of morcerf peer of france oh cried the general as if branded with a hot iron wretch to reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me				98.16005394609363
good said he it was time and he sealed his will with three seals				12839.104791075919
that s more time than we want				2271.9321714792777
monte cristo advanced a few steps which were heard on the gravel				20330.200059772254
go leave me i would be alone				882.3429851859464
your devotion does not commit you too far monsieur de rochefort and then my lord continued rochefort you understand that to emerge from the bastile in order to enter vincennes is only to change one s prison say at once that you are on the side of monsieur de beaufort that will be the most sincere line of conduct said mazarin				575.6592794140525
when it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one				924.724988582852
ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese your family name is monte cristo sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation and yet the first day you set foot in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess my dear vicomte returned monte cristo i do not see in all i have done anything that merits either from you or these gentlemen the pretended eulogies i have received				4380.132655478472
d artagnan who had just dismounted then saw outlined against the wall the enormous stomach of mousqueton whose down drawn mouth emitted sounds of distress				8468.053403322036
she has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may obtain his pardon				14786.67087919507
my friend cried athos suddenly where have you brought us				419.3459724276537
my dear mistress turquaine said the gascon if you happen to have any money lock it up quickly if you happen to have any jewels hide them directly if you happen to have any debtors make them pay you or any creditors don t pay them why prithee asked madeleine				16324.09459670132
then he had eaten some without saying a word more danglars therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of the cavalcanti who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and lobsters sent from england by the same means used by the count to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga				59557.27634211763
but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us asked aramis				94.61528070029385
villefort again groaned with anguish and despair				2029.536895677401
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection				81525.10016090424
well will you take me or shall i take edward madame de villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one answer but to all her inquiries m de villefort remained mute and cold as a statue				3207.0132191597586

all all all are thine my adored mistress and he kissed the letter with passion without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table				694.246530964372
at the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number d artagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the chamber				862.8801804889395
this is a kind of usury banker that i do not understand take all then take all i tell you and kill me come come calm yourself				1621.7036160937555
my father is king s attorney replied andrea calmly				2135.236562666232

aramis returned laughing one hat on his head and the other in his hand and he and his companion resumed their walk toward the convent				3267.734427393743
go my son go my dear gérard and by your obedience to my paternal orders or if you prefer it friendly counsels we will keep you in your place				847.587004067682
more closely watched than ever the queen felt certain without knowing how to tell which that one of her women had betrayed her				249.70051040674778
milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes				378.7407667474997
then he paused				3356.596728840645
he is neither a gentleman in manner nor in feeling but a sort of buffoon a punchinello a pantaloon				36686.22531126185

dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible				1825.2067153549
your highness s most devoted servant in the bastile as elsewhere comte de rochefort the duke who had latterly been allowed a fire burned the letter but kept the ball and went to bed hiding the ball under his bolster				12831.062789566859
march forward but eloquent as he might be the eloquence of the grandson of henry iv				1246.87541665893
that count of monte cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night and where do the servants sleep oh they have a house to themselves				2403.0783592140965
ambushes and violences multiplied around me but i resisted				7093.883281493355
is it you aramis said porthos				13.733442905728793
poor child				941.5653125512349
your name the baroness danglars you have seen me twenty times possibly madame				769.0074009387151
for added he the future can not fail to mend i inevitably look for better times				2706.237547769458
milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked d artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england				927.7636597114573
the name of d artagnan was not altogether new to mazarin who although he did not arrive in france before the year or that is to say about eight or nine years after the events which we have related in a preceding narrative fancied he had heard it pronounced as that of one who was said to be a model of courage address and loyalty				8011.582981882762
i shall soon return and if you will wait only a few minutes for me as soon as i have concluded my business with that friend as it is growing late i will come back and reconduct you to the louvre thank you monsieur you are not brave enough to be of any use to me whatever replied mme				157.49157239678135
he caused me to be arrested had me conducted hither and placed me under your guard				1809.8331070165564
it was of this detachment sent as a vanguard that our friend d artagnan formed a part				5615.3264527326755
my senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities				47986.73260962595
i was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have anything soporific introduced into them				128.218938736182
the poor fellow does not know the purpose for which i am here he then made a sign for mousqueton to come to him				76.49960050379501
yes yes i see him well enough said d artagnan				5.075553907074921
go to bed and sleep at dinnertime we will rouse you although milady would very willingly have gone without sleep sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart ever thirsting for intrigues she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior				5568.206780477289
i was looking anxiously for some iris roots i planted here close to this reservoir and which some one has trampled upon this morning				687.3706253502546
you are a man of taste				1861.1861674302718
dividing the proceeds the apartment on the first floor of the house in the rue saint germain des prés where albert de morcerf had selected a home for his mother was let to a very mysterious person				1313.2448873906847
and what effect did this discourse produce anxiously inquired albert				236.3543191019054
the count of monte cristo said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery				20713.786328841088
why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual				73850.55571644954
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly				2115.1627829307527
he had his foot upon it that is all and i thought from having his foot upon it the handkerchief was his and you were deceived my dear sir replied aramis coldly very little sensible to the reparation				93075.29020669364
the prince assigned the count de guiche to his father and kept bragelonne near his own person but the two young men sought the privilege of passing the night together and it was accorded them				133.84280976991516
a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel nothing appeared to him perfectly impossible				1766.0530467641368
there it is cried the jesuit the world still speaks within you in a loud voice altisimâ voce				74431.61835239462
felton s orders were for the rest executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline				35516.501041762844
unhappy girl replied eugénie unhappy girl do you say sir				235.4915818796811
the lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth				9393.056818104274
see him and hear what he says m				427.86199300150577
who knows said gondy such men are like thunderbolts one recognizes them only when they have struck every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart				422.44091669616495
i had vague perceptions of space traversed of the rolling of a carriage of a horrible dream in which my strength had become exhausted but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine and yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality				54552.848138294496
planchet planchet added grimaud planchet with a gorget indeed ah gentlemen cried planchet so you are back again in paris				429.08254907768463
ah cried the cardinal i thought you were a gascon my friend i am a gascon said i only when i succeed the answer pleased him and he laughed				1579.4770505593278
oh thanks				2522.8155447778904
yes monsieur a most excellent sister married nearly nine years happy asked the count again				330.62612237925316
do not despair				2085.7430293853336
charles s heart melted within him at the sight of those two children whom he had not seen for two years and whom he now met at the moment of death				721.3595224409934
in the other he announces that he is about to transport his prisoners to melun since rueil seemed to him not sufficiently secure				18569.82538137001
he soon saw that the vessel with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the château d if and the tower of planier				47256.78121630957
say there is no need why dantès should die it would indeed be a pity he should				129955.84624363677
at a distance albert thought it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten				6222.159230603153
yes monsieur replied the terrified citizen in a tone so low that he was scarcely audible				11053.801875064946
lucien said the baroness i assure you i have no desire to sleep and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me i am at your service madame replied lucien coldly				9101.666838965664
i must then place my life my honor my reputation in your hands yes yes madame you must and i will save them all but how				3448.201081222837
my officer said the sergeant it is not permitted to stop here that prohibition is not for me said d artagnan				20.020882734648534
consequently he had appeared to believe all that the vainglorious musketeer had told him convinced that no friendship will hold out against a surprised secret				1465.0703583094642
he advanced slowly toward milady who had seated herself and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect or perhaps by design she allowed to be seen what is this madame he asked coldly				6750.644784387715
however the revolution which appeared upon his countenance was so visible that bonacieux was terrified at it and he endeavored to draw back a step or two but as he was standing before the half of the door which was shut the obstacle compelled him to keep his place				908.7490097913302
the pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with louis xii				9319.941693625748
ah i understand				1359.2648326451397
i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the secret cause of my presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had the power to read my heart				400.73369324419843
from this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer but to have everything he wanted				3052.6972490602443
was he to be carried back by the wind which had blown him there				975.7904420308755
one fine morning the king commanded m de chevalier dessessart to admit d artagnan as a cadet in his company of guards				1338.3630444274004
he will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to take				43983.98073478682
bonacieux and a convent was not impregnable				17810.44631541736
it is my father who has just left his study to accompany the doctor to the door added morrel				851.9148592167097
it is not aramis cried he				27.259401320668456
bah said danglars a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in love				1549.3054011774104
do you come from the end of the world said monte cristo you a journalist the husband of renown				13425.849192460684
and what was this man s name danglars what rank did he hold on board he was supercargo and had you been captain should you have retained him in his employment not if the choice had remained with me for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his accounts good again				397.85127809738907
at every noise he heard the simple puritan fancied he recognized the step and voice of milady coming to throw herself into his arms to accuse herself and die with him				77.53685000921878
thanks madame said porthos but i don t like to abuse your kindness besides i must think of my outfit that s true said the procurator s wife groaning that unfortunate outfit alas yes said porthos it is so but of what then does the equipment of your company consist monsieur porthos oh of many things said porthos				173.86090397637722
supposing that after having eaten the leather they eat the soles i can not see much that is left unless they eat one another poor fools said athos emptying a glass of excellent bordeaux wine which without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys merited it no less poor fools				66618.97768981325
however for my part i would rather die unshriven than have anything to say to such a confessor				19674.999235394574
was it not by chance he caused the earth to be dug up				1192.4900576716298
this was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen s coachmen on a cold night and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door				337.1598389497912
meanwhile the heat became excessive				75956.34796608535
how exquisitely coselli sings his part but what an awkward inelegant fellow he is well then what do you say to la specchia				34904.96525180995
at nine o clock tomorrow rita s father will be here with the money it is well in the meantime we will have a merry night this young girl is charming and does credit to your taste				1897.4323834406414
he urged the horse again into a trot				12779.564438727573
at this moment the door of the minister s box opened and madame danglars accompanied by her daughter entered escorted by lucien debray who assiduously conducted them to their seats				53944.85612154946
now then were a conspirator to fall into your hands he would be most welcome for my part dear mother interposed renée i trust your wishes will not prosper and that providence will only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into m de villefort s hands then i shall be contented just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any other slight affection of the epidermis				21452.95235282046
here said he i want to show you the kind of passport which i have drawn up and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life i consent to leave you then turning his eyes from milady to the paper he read order to conduct the name is blank interrupted lord de winter				943.5662649455209
ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room				214.88681882629018
has your uneasiness anything to do with what m de blacas has told me and m de villefort has just confirmed m de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect				20299.124856611947
the queen smiled but instead of answering see de winter she said i have at least gained one thing in being only half a queen and that is that my children call me mother instead of madame then turning toward her daughter what do you want henrietta she demanded				4687.6617241588465
it appears that the method i have adopted with this boy is decidedly the best				6259.524082442509
why are not my frenchmen here he murmured proudly and turning his eyes to the benches where they had appeared for a moment they would have seen that their friend was worthy of their defense while alive and of their tears when dead well said the president seeing that charles was determined to remain silent so be it				87.68761172765728
but would you believe that i purchase all this delight joy and happiness for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life at the small cost of francs per annum paid quarterly				50486.68476184081
the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable distance under the earth				1598.1289559486763
at this moment a man entered without even knocking at the door				366.15967038635773
still more he has lifted the corner of her mask that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong				5075.502359642761
a part of the good abbé s words however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as faria along the heights of truth where he was so much at home				1341.3607429169456
oh sir in pity send for a physician my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery of my boy with a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand monte cristo signed to the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions then opening a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of bohemian glass incrusted with gold containing a liquid of the color of blood of which he let fall a single drop on the child s lips				697.7754449299553
a complicated affair said porthos where will you begin it is arranged capitally his eminence expects me in half an hour good my friend said d artagnan turning to the servant tell his eminence that in half an hour i shall be at his command it is very fortunate resumed the gascon when the valet had retired that he did not meet the other one do you not think that they have sent for you both for the same thing i do not think it i am certain of it quick quick d artagnan				156.5840116944049
do you hear not a single creature				43874.092845482046
i will await you at the corner of the rue du musée and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i will hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me then emmanuel said the young girl with hesitation it is your opinion that i should obey this invitation yes				1062.3329002772757
beauchamp my good fellow you know i am starving said debray do not set him off on some long story well i do not prevent your sitting down to table replied beauchamp château renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast gentlemen said morcerf it is only a quarter past ten and i expect someone else ah true a diplomatist observed debray				894.5048907230918
i will tell them to send her to you villefort returned and d avrigny met him in the passage				2255.2431409293536
has he not come said kitty				728.3086623384562
there is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the person of her mother s admitted lover enabled mademoiselle danglars to defy malice and ill nature				3509.9891493352557
no no				502.9613578611669
you think then that you can help me more efficaciously than your brothers said gondy				1823.5425401206485
exteriorly nothing in the room showed that it was the habitation of an abbé				1168.5155214338997
it was just in time for valentine s head swam and she staggered madame de villefort instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her husband in dragging her to the carriage saying what a singular event				4322.238098715688
the sitting commences at two it is now three and i am to speak go then and monsieur and i will strive our best to forget your absence replied the countess with the same tone of deep feeling				4762.49438394427
master broussel is being strangled it was friquet s voice and dame nanette feeling herself supported recommenced with all her strength to sound her shrilly squawk				53020.10985627238
of what use is it to be a churchman pray				60739.46823364432
oh i wish it you with all my heart added caderousse with his hoarse laugh				2413.2016746077156
a quarter of an hour afterwards the door of valentine s room opened and monte cristo reappeared				2793.0349278143367
they had the misfortune to be devoted to that very queen for whom just now you were seeking servants but how is it that you know so much of these matters i know them because the men of whom i speak were at that time my enemies because they fought against me because i did them all the harm i could and they returned it to the best of their ability because one of them with whom i had most to do gave me a pretty sword thrust now about seven years ago the third that i received from the same hand it closed an old account ah said mazarin with admirable suavity could i but find such men my lord there has stood for six years at your very door a man such as i describe and during those six years he has been unappreciated and unemployed by you who is it it is monsieur d artagnan that gascon cried mazarin with well acted surprise				1935.0265744950302
that was what he could not know				1102.2027075792453
the fifth sharer in edmond s bequest was his own father too true too true ejaculated caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die i learned so much at marseilles replied the abbé making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dantès i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end				847.867538201974
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin				532.2488022755576
the king excited by the cardinal made a terrible clamor				41828.87473165236
you must take grimaud and olivain both sir asked raoul astonished				1352.1248566453587
what are yanina and its vizier to you edmond				1162.8420842898033
od s bodikins said groslow as the four friends entered i had almost given you up d artagnan went up to him and whispered in his ear the fact is we that is monsieur du vallon and i hesitated a little and why d artagnan looked significantly toward athos and aramis				320.49569710718885
well he found us on his road and will not be baron this time				352.52678662906004
i beg you to excuse me and propose to the chevalier and athos bowing retired and remained leaning against the mantelpiece a spectator of the scene				1198.1567346448326
m cavalcanti remained master of the field				13077.483742204624
well it is impossible but that master aramis that keen scented bloodhound and athos that wise and prudent nobleman will discover our retreat				4108.738611263318
you have no right to put me to death alone				856.96042817464
it is a duel then cried mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation				39359.92571117669
there said he demand thy child of carlini he will tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his companions				884.1620074519914
monte cristo then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the door taking care that the light should shine directly on his face				941.9205174371608
he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in m de tréville s stables one for himself d artagnan and one for planchet and bring them to athos s place				906.3264894848172
you see my poor friend that i am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps i am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to mazarin i cried d artagnan not in the least you spoke of a mission did i				683.4164278113335
it was only a momentary glance but it seemed to the countess to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that one look				993.5839424912464
every folly you committed would embroil you with the court and they would put you into the bastile instead of vincennes				5666.28063042933
not one of them will do as he says he murmured with his little monkey smile but they may do as they please the brave gentlemen				1796.5668074594098
this plan succeeded and signor pastrini himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his excellency wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him to albert when morcerf himself appeared				857.1471926961525
i have a son				748.591995839891
one step farther into rest two perhaps into silence				895.8443536901875
the utility of stovepipes it was evident that without suspecting it and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection				62823.72537652607
listen he said today is the of september is it not yes today then at eleven o clock your father has nearly three hundred thousand francs to pay yes we know that well then continued emmanuel we have not fifteen thousand francs in the house what will happen then why if today before eleven o clock your father has not found someone who will come to his aid he will be compelled at twelve o clock to declare himself a bankrupt oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young man				208.5230827308456
night had closed in and paris seen thus by the light of lanterns flickering on the pools of water crowded with ferry boats of every kind including those that glittered with the armed patrols with the watchword passing from post to post paris presented such an aspect as to strongly seize the senses of aramis a man most susceptible to warlike impressions				47053.60392593007
the man somewhat crest fallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said				375.5159164078951
cavalcanti s asked beauchamp				480.73048798356854
a war of partisans unworthy of a king the example of robert bruce will absolve you sire no no				478.98349773497665
teresa followed him with her eyes into the darkness as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the house with a sigh				668.1589793806999
if you do escape remember that the poor abbé whom all the world called mad was not so				539.9230657798672
he will see us if we go out then you must come up into my room ah said mme				36.8531722341459
well mercédès beloved by you i would tempt fortune you would bring me good luck and i should become rich				6317.7816978081955
they were both aroused at seven o clock by the entrance of an unliveried servant who brought a letter for d artagnan				222.5677335724456
i don t very well know what but still something monseigneur said d artagnan this was what happened to me never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it				87.67256044338544
the two cavalcanti bowed to the count and left the house				445.0229859270269
when once more in her own apartment anne fell into a chair and wept then suddenly struck with an idea i am saved she exclaimed rising oh yes				1126.6664945673897
i admire i love him for i know his former adventures but i shall not speak to him until the day after to morrow and why day after to morrow asked madame de chevreuse				2671.7516320177833
the poniard was pointed at the sixth rib and buried up to the hilt in his body				1511.0743863600094
the devil exclaimed porthos there s vulcan foundered zounds cried d artagnan then we must stop				3248.99054206004
nor was that surprising				75898.78188482442

suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard				1451.774523992598
as he was finishing this work the sound of horses prancing in the yard and the wheels of a carriage shaking his window attracted his attention				2142.5880874301047

how will you prove continued the jesuit without allowing him time to speak that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to god				484.7428506734597
milady was then able to judge of the effect she had produced				7726.635679112867

i place no confidence in their hypocritical faces				8112.285114274665

that is never done				1458.3610446122398
andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king s attorney				3124.633922734292
i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said planchet and if i am taken i will swallow it well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said d artagnan				102.00131393176301
this horse is decidedly or rather has been in his youth a buttercup resumed the stranger continuing the remarks he had begun and addressing himself to his auditors at the window without paying the least attention to the exasperation of d artagnan who however placed himself between him and them				133.5726722186605
but it s of no importance continued d artagnan with natural assurance it s of no importance				4542.501712135494
d artagnan was again in the presence of the circe who had before surrounded him with her enchantments				62558.928666915715
listen to me edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him				86.38986890745545
but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of health				5788.611036225806
coquenard recognized her present and could not at first comprehend this restitution but the visit of porthos soon enlightened her				242.1173004487398

though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape				2073.674288849069
i then swore that this woman who had ruined him who was more than his accomplice since she had urged him to the crime should at least share his punishment				3579.2994048747983

grimaud extended his arm and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river within a hundred paces of a ferry				13148.790852629192
the calash contained mademoiselle danglars and mademoiselle d armilly				9953.532124202822

farther on a still greater terror seized him on passing by the cemetery of st jean where state criminals were buried				36105.30131736727
i am an assassin then and not an officer of justice and he closed his eyes with a groan				1922.9439654806176
the will as soon as barrois had left the room noirtier looked at valentine with a malicious expression that said many things				1943.9964960126908
but he added in this war prisoners stand a chance of being hung the deuce they do said mousqueton i think i should like the siege of rochelle better than this war then porthos meantime asked d artagnan to give him his instructions how to proceed on his journey				2474.8139436501306
franz thanked the count for his attention				2058.518171470865
i don t know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was rather rather strong in greek he spoke the romaic language did he i think so that settles it murmured franz				695.5298433728115

vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover				5393.628934727906
albert extended his hand				277.2638229736428
but ere he entered his travelling carriage albert fearing that his expected guest might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the care of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo on which beneath the name of viscount albert de morcerf he had written in pencil rue du helder on the st may half past ten a m chapter				360.03384604525974
counting his treasures replied the governor				1545.318246946143
come come said monte cristo confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in thomson french				3177.6618802950225
but said aramis if they dare to condemn their king it can only be to exile or imprisonment d artagnan whistled a little air of incredulity				15690.975045055193
i know what is become of vasiliki and haydée				2948.8739291597108
caderousse scarcely yet relying on this promise put his legs out of the window and stood on the ladder				2043.1512995167693
i will no longer detain you m de villefort for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and rest				1490.931074457274

sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome				2183.0213102405937
milady reclining in an armchair near the chimney beautiful pale and resigned looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom				21864.685882826085
have you seen alas did you recognize valentine groaned				2852.5357416682596

if i take you you will be hung the young man did not wait to be told twice but passing under the horse s head disappeared at the corner of the rue guenegaud				13462.030428008224
we performed the usual burial service and he is at his rest sewn up in his hammock with a thirty six pound shot at his head and his heels off el giglio island				6692.345134766942
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the custom house officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues mortes				70979.53976278444
ah monsieur hypocrite i understand how you study theology the three blows were scarcely struck when the inside blind was opened and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter				18391.62450506219
since mazarin has sent for you it is because he wants you				149.97183385076715
they passed through the gate like apparitions without the guards thinking of detaining them and reached the open country				2831.834245618576
but he can easily become one if he is not already it is no uncommon thing in italy				2408.847889870497
now as a half smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily imagined				30250.453776829425
this time however his address although polite was cooler than usual				3093.268228254722
science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of strength fancies if i may be allowed so to term them				129.60198467960612
knocked on the head				520.5056778811534
that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room your humble servant going first to show the way at these words moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his guest				4601.753279014354
however i had better find him out first since he can t want money				824.2282535795953
one would say you were carrying me off and they would be right pardieu oh i think you swore eugénie and the two young girls whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief the one on her own account the other from interest in her friend burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape				1987.7981130832618
many men might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose appearance was more significant if the expression may be used				3897.2867647997723
he resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the comte de rochefort and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to send to london				1648.5948600801685

a servant wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlord s hands who forthwith presented them to the two young men he said please to deliver these from the count of monte cristo to vicomte albert de morcerf and m franz d épinay				3453.805880146107
athos assisted by porthos who lifted him up like a feather arrived at the top				12704.43059780101
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand				288.5911351429673
porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly and shuddered when he felt the knee of the procurator s wife under the table as it came in search of his				1638.1789124678846
this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make my fortune				874.3230220028555

excuse me excuse you for what				514.3062125843352
tréville was one of these latter				2287.3765480704596
let us try not to find them out by accident but from our notions				79359.69594748571
besides as m de tréville saw the queen almost daily he might be able to draw from her majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress				1529.8957634100082
because as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us he took him for the chief said d artagnan				14.958558961671313
i will teach you how to laugh to morrow but in another manner but whilst they were indulging in extravagant joy at the palais royal to increase the hilarity of the queen mazarin a man of sense and whose fear moreover gave him foresight lost no time in making idle and dangerous jokes he went out after the coadjutor settled his account locked up his gold and had confidential workmen to contrive hiding places in his walls				11690.784578892288
valentine rose to fetch the dictionary				6801.800182206771

but alas i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security i trust we shall never find it so in our experience oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness until that time continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in a word and i repeat it because it expresses all i wish to convey we will wait and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name morrel looked obedience to her commands				13349.232511002969

he opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were and found porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis				372.99572676936856
and the count pressed her hand in reply as he had done eleven years before on the staircase leading to morrel s study				3559.9496428059274

thirty strides brought them to dry land the young man stamped on the ground to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his road for it was quite dark				2085.0171270941582

here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said d artagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it there is no desert where a bird can not pass over one s head where a fish can not leap out of the water where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal				243.84375499804835

from the top of an eminence d artagnan perceived a group of people collected on the other side of the moat in front of that part of the donjon which looks toward saint maur				57463.16989433758
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness at these words there appeared in noirtier s eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there you are mistaken i can still do much for you do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said valentine				799.9199510944502

the will was never wanting to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall tis true i said so and i say it again and i answered you porthos that it was not a good plan that we couldn t go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves that is true we should need clothes and arms well said d artagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better bah said porthos looking around				2845.9219912609906

• you provide in accordance with paragraph f a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within days of receipt of the work				1262.7178850991022
but for the moment let us do as did the amorous gascon we will see after the worthy mercer later				3087.2914696981725
it resulted from these antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which they met besides it would not be unlikely that they would have an opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready				753.6298216318186
well said he filling the glasses let us drink to captain edmond dantès husband of the beautiful catalane caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp				47127.029841176416
m bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed				3657.9652273900624
take care for i warn you that the first man that comes within the length of my sword and my sword is long i rip him up the chieftain of the party drew near				3333.179519759947
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some water from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid				37154.9018999257
so au revoir dear athos au revoir said the musketeer making a sign to grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought				80695.7293858422
then at the other extremity he heard the footsteps of those who were pursuing him				78.35164846685072
i have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to tréport well then that is settled but you will come and call on my mother before tomorrow before tomorrow that will be a difficult matter to arrange besides i shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure well you can do better				980.7818011661723

i ask pardon of your eminence said d artagnan but i was so fatigued don t ask my pardon monsieur said mazarin for you fatigued yourself in my service d artagnan admired mazarin s gracious manner				911.4930602679228
in the meantime anne of austria approached comminges and conversed with him in a subdued tone whilst mazarin glanced uneasily at the corner occupied by d artagnan and porthos				307.39430182389145
finally the prince led the right wing resting on aunay				6421.998653098238
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself				377.12768190369064
you were writing said monte cristo with a searching look				1019.577468372664
my father and m danglars served together in spain my father in the army and m danglars in the commissariat department				8456.391959764567
he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pères where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess				1640.0343997125015
the king seeing that he did not reply repeated his question				1929.6069007661886
i will then release you from all your promises even that of procuring my admission into the musketeers for before everything i wish to avenge myself beware young man cried tréville				880.0600961570048
by a chance which added yet more to the intensity of the darkness the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven o clock and the streets which the young man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity				1165.8346095026252
morrel threw a glance around but before it reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived				53606.63564443759
is it large middling how is it arranged faith i should require pen ink and paper to make a plan they are all here said caderousse briskly				83686.19682930097
i shall hear this morning that m danglars make a speech at the chamber of deputies and at his wife s this evening i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france				766.7204543812416
your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear m de morcerf these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the doors of that fashionable world of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china oh that i do and with infinite pleasure answered albert and so much the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of marriage my dear franz do not smile i beg of you with a family of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society connected by marriage you mean said franz laughingly				20343.87347054967

matrimonial projects the day following this scene at the hour debray usually chose to pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office his coupé did not appear				7110.674187237799
toward paris who stopped him two young gentlemen who were on their way to join the army and the name of one of whom i heard his companion mention the viscount de bragelonne and it was this young man who brought the monk to you				181.8142867337396
the truth was it had been entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m danglars and his architect who had been selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day				459.50654211944607
do you know him				54.03633479055315
madame de villefort instantly stepped back close to the wall and there shaded by the bed curtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of valentine				924.6883910185155
does he often go to auteuil added he				431.2317386344111
arrested he exclaimed he was taken at compiègne and all is over madame danglars rose from her seat pale and cold				2034.9538826192786
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse				58164.984883413345
pooh said porthos it is always that				507.9954875163841
join the escort cried aramis				25.917633886571515
besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture				5385.014869953067
were i in her majesty s place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate i should release broussel and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen				375.76668402071925
i depend on you				169.16589810194915
you ll bet for me and those gentlemen for monsieur groslow by this arrangement d artagnan could nudge porthos with his knee and make signs with his eyes to athos and aramis				324.042824950429
i wish to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime thing in the world is to recompense and punish satan bowed his head and groaned				2390.374488178904
that gascon has saved a queen and made monsieur de richelieu confess that in point of talent address and political skill to him he was only a tyro really it is as i have the honor of telling it to your excellency tell me a little about it my dear monsieur de rochefort that is somewhat difficult my lord said rochefort with a smile				490.8424120234305
the little house was surrounded by a low quickset hedge two or three feet high				16173.566631397036
let us drink heartily and while we do so tell me a little of what is going on in the world yonder chapter xxvii				16093.282478788407
you wish to know what i will do yes i will find him as i told you				68.58560388878136
i do not dare offer to share my apartments with you as i shared yours at rome i who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence for except myself these rooms would not hold a shadow more unless that shadow were feminine ah said the count that is a most conjugal reservation i recollect that at rome you said something of a projected marriage				6016.293426511857
thus for instance the excellent abbé adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in this way some marvellous experiments really yes i will mention one to you				164.8896701729021
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge				12627.606760674555
the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves				3360.257581137528
the dining room was scarcely less striking than the room he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value and at the four corners of this apartment which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their hands				546.4662335210069
maximilian crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards				10093.986114171712
at thirty five which was then his age he passed with just title for the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of france or england				917.3808545612546
they are destined to produce at least ten				6821.034451609574
the poor mercer remained standing at the door while the eyes of the personage we have just described were fixed upon him and appeared to wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past				2875.64744699011
but how is it he is not already returned				720.2472905376353
it was night when the two adversaries reached the field of battle				1673.4868156877715
felton did not enter				1744.6183423576745
the accusation chapter				222.4634336386881
at length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him				71.58786109761077
years have elapsed many events have happened alas				1114.8160392637697
what vessel is that asked milady				135.797623403916
no no like shakespeare s polonius he died for another				787.5675361375535
he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias				42554.81783058325
the singularity of this step and above all its formality had not a little surprised the banker who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing first to the drawing room				200.44673557370808
he pushed the door open and entered				573.551999150807
then the question was put to him who was the best jailer in all the prisons in france				800.8817363553601
the young woman continued to advance and in addition to the lightness of her step which had betrayed her she emitted a little cough which denoted a sweet voice				641.1818427470068
here it is said he				7.240313916807185
i was hipped to death and still further upon my honor i don t like english horses				1822.0883917743195
at last he heard the voice of la ramee				2143.9943606131887
and now my dear friend said faria sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at the moment of separating from you forever i wish you all the happiness and all the prosperity you so well deserve				3788.787806186317
how did these letters come said he				12.40401428702786
here said she here is a ring of great value as i have been assured				4976.754187101629
i made no resistance i was no longer master of my senses				2452.4714053481707
his voice had become rough and hoarse his face was furrowed with wrinkles his eyes burned under the blue veined lids and he tottered like a drunken man				220.6498114972708
upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the russian ambassador				73830.97894452492
many young men of palestrina frascati and pampinara had disappeared				1292.176753157529
let out your prisoner				1109.7281830867319
ah yes said porthos there is nine o clock				994.9683370697577
it appeared then to d artagnan that m bonacieux wore a mask and likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon				2193.358356082704
d artagnan smiled this jealous anger of milady was his revenge				4773.402800390282
bazin set out the next day for tours and was allowed eight days for performing his commission				3387.0839807042626
my dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you				151.21266874477834
the sight of this creature who had nothing of the woman about her recalled awful remembrances				15949.049931498757
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me and you you would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis				190.75664333631116
i thought that calumny was stifled or extinct you have spared me till now but since you speak of it once for all i tell you madame i do not ask you to tell me said mazarin astounded by this returning courage				712.6338963677746
they had not yet begun to slay but it was well felt that the inclination to do so was not wanting				25446.14493062774
but d artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious				12815.336096969417
felton let me die well then we will live and die together cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner				1370.6313505312107
you are very fortunate to have lost believe me my dear d artagnan				26.462022257539846
the elder prisoner pondered the matter				507.87172249082914
so sir you lived at lucca did you				96.27266714456982
motives of hatred against dantès				543.7614020403422
he said nothing he only girded on his sword wrapped himself in his cloak and went straight to buckingham palace				1482.082171810933
well one of these two men said he must certainly be at noisy or be coming there this evening for i have seen his servant art thou sure said the man in the cloak				1239.9621240059455
both however cast an inquisitive glance into the tankard it was full of gunpowder				11739.988916387514
this costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellow creature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption ah said franz then you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably				50154.35944729369
but as for me i have been a coward i have denied god and he has abandoned me mercédès burst into tears her woman s heart was breaking under its load of memories				10718.249627313327
ah that s it he cried you have your promotion and i my barony we are going to fetch our brevets said d artagnan and when we come back master mazarin will sign them and where are we going asked porthos				125.00370681948044
the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it				90.0542677975453
as if the same idea had animated these two beings mercédès was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in his				1524.9540286765866
my friends said parry mounting the scaffold and standing beside them would you work a little more quietly				1463.8420361373485
dantès saluted villefort and retired				763.5703460180393
to make you two costumes between now and tomorrow				1418.038040195352
m bonacieux was at his door				320.41990523867344
my dear danglars said morcerf we have been acquainted for many years and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each other s failings				33001.75261178293
the count advanced to meet him				68.91096201005085
porthos was the first who came to himself				349.575476449744
you are almost a boy i see that you require someone to answer for me i admit that would reassure me greatly do you know athos no porthos no aramis no				547.5828961896825
he found as provident a host and a fresh horse				976.6651196305287
then a fearful crash was heard a cloud of dust mounted toward the sky and all was over				1866.3985387921962
the opinion of athos was that d artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish				7927.327232770225
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else woman woman why do you have such ideas cried caderousse or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man what do you mean added caderousse				363.9458457573752
what was i saying				15147.594207184025
but was it on her own account or on account of another that she exposed herself to such hazards				53916.15698868013
i have almost killed myself by my needless haste				1375.901371067658
and yet he did not wish to be at paris when the count was there				969.8939883922316
you asked for candor and you have it				78.38352386266226
it was dark and silent as the tomb				2805.7534058938327
well sirs cried the queen on perceiving the two friends you have come faithful friends				550.7632514242157
will you allow me father said carmela				18272.13107678244
there remained in the banker s house only danglars closeted in his study and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes madame danglars terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and eugénie who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her room with her inseparable companion mademoiselle louise d armilly				8760.603688998519
but in that same banker s study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocket money you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry				23109.881936257018
ten minutes after one is taken the effect is produced				7229.521670628754
kitty entered to bring some sherbet				47862.46225877886
since it is opened i will take advantage of it to enter your room do not disturb yourself do not disturb yourself and passing his hand through the broken glass the count opened the door				328.53829802491055
the whole but how my god by a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which i likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinal s police and what did you understand by what we said a thousand things				1957.1724003948998
come i have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget fatigue and cold monte cristo perceived that the young man had turned around indeed morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a word				624.9458372972248
do not touch the axe said the king and resumed his speech				7339.76431719268
just as the court was settling down in the cathedral a carriage bearing the arms of comminges quitted the line of the court carriages and proceeded slowly to the end of the rue saint christophe now entirely deserted				5296.080459679256
you already know two of them and you appeared to appreciate them like a judge				4465.424187408356
what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the law of reprisals what cried i do you a magistrate speak thus to me all these corsicans are mad on my honor replied m de villefort they fancy that their countryman is still emperor				7154.097851043848
athos entered without the least mistrust and took out two pistoles to pay the bill				25022.22246324859
i have a fancy and mean to get a housekeeper well you shall have your five hundred francs said andrea but it is very hard for me my poor caderousse you take advantage bah said caderousse when you have access to countless stores one would have said andrea anticipated his companion s words so did his eye flash like lightning but it was but for a moment				619.460084133293
at eight o clock in the morning morrel entered their chamber				894.9750537950777
napoleon in the island of elba is too near france and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans				13355.956076713219
in the evening at the appointed hour the four friends met				4629.166647379269
he was still young he was only four or five and twenty he had nearly fifty years to live				5105.28997805269
oh real enough from anxiety doubtless at any rate they postponed the matter for two months				2519.4374565863823
so you like it you rogue so much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard living do you see said caderousse all my happiness is marred by one thought what is that that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly do not let that disturb you i have enough for two no truly you may believe me if you will at the end of every month i am tormented by remorse good caderousse so much so that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me true remorse and besides an idea had struck me andrea shuddered he always did so at caderousse s ideas				4300.856719987569
that would not be endurable in any case and is still less so on the part of those who came to bring the queen the message of a liar sir cried de chatillon				8402.186540658717
only a few minutes ago they brought me the tavolettas what are they sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening before an execution on which is pasted up a paper containing the names of the condemned persons their crimes and mode of punishment				3539.8131548987917
there is one comfort we are all in cash said d artagnan				6.238330983727885
athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone				1082.3050533121643
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming				10922.135524998557
it is true she said the arch hypocrite see i see said mazarin that everybody kneels before him although he be but coadjutor whilst i were i in his place though i am cardinal should be torn to pieces				6001.325506008089
benedetto if still living will become the instrument of divine retribution in some way or other and then be duly punished in his turn				914.651352648166
we have cruelly wounded as you know that personal pride by which d artagnan is blindly governed				69830.87190935336
planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol				2052.3973351253094
chapter lxi				70864.96316761925
his warm and fickle imagination which in gascony had rendered him formidable to young chambermaids and even sometimes their mistresses had never dreamed even in moments of delirium of half the amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the least concealed				11942.028816727965
madame de saint méran chapter				296.690897979219
he would have written or at this instant someone knocked at the door				353.95716781828617
the king even while obeying him like a child hated him as a child hates his master and would abandon him to the personal vengeance of monsieur and the queen				532.0678764808027
you would then be in present possession of the letter				733.499530647877
d artagnan looked attentively at the building				15320.18702320352
madame said athos when must we set out you consent then exclaimed the queen joyfully				3242.298532131067
it was evident that he shared his master s apprehensions				4563.234503699349

i would lay a wager he has stolen it do you think so answered d artagnan but little convinced as he knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this letter was and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity				22350.17231135666

as to you that is not my concern and i shall sup either with or without your permission the young man s eyes kindled in secret but he restrained himself				350.39288106721233

i have perhaps offended you in your creed but it was without wishing to do so i swear				84894.6127687049
those who are known are not the most dangerous i know it and appeal to your penetration				56357.80466131388
ah this visit was expected				2414.610547687097
stop said he i have an idea well that s something for i have not the shadow of one said athos coolly but as to d artagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to ours has driven him out of his senses				2452.2281760753044
besides he said a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about on the contrary it is a matter of the utmost importance edmond replied the old man				189.7292089185108
there are many stories related of him and among them this				1454.2583986689936
it was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as i have heard him say but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i agreed and how much did she give you for this fine enterprise a hundred louis well come said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth something				3284.302314120341
he committed a crime it is true but he repented of it and the four friends quit the room leaving to planchet and fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont				73722.06358295427
what do you think of the story chalais s esquire relates asked another musketeer without addressing anyone in particular but on the contrary speaking to everybody				4763.6209005627825
i do not know you read this letter he said handing it to her				171.89764686649156
he would have spoken but his voice failed him				73.30533494077088

behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with wax lights				8400.439899237062
except your signature and your partner s m morrel and why should he not have this asked the owner he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over danglars brow				1033.8784179728143

you have no enemy here there is no one but fernand my brother who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend and at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards edmond and offered him his hand				288.4215106780255
the officer entered				551.6205987682133
no do not seek any longer to discover the reason				1481.2788582197834

what can i do for you valentine valentine looked around her she saw the deepest terror depicted in noirtier s eyes				401.5935402017961
he had divined in the past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could cover and he felt from one cause or another that this woman was his own as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior to the danger which threatened her				212.76261062929615
his desire for blood returned burning his brain and pervading his frame like a raging fever he arose in his turn reached his hand to his belt drew forth a pistol and cocked it				96.89939238021226

the street was laid out a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the line of the proposed street and so making it a branch of communication with the faubourg saint honoré itself one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris				470.7635743992296
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every rock in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity franz was not without uneasiness corsica had long since disappeared and monte cristo itself was invisible but the sailors seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation				3109.90343342548
as to d artagnan who as yet knew nobody in the capital he only found one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the guards				1344.697257147374
yes sdeath				197976.34332892633
he is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse the executioner muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection				2272.1412660448655
his piercing look was fixed in vain on the satirical face of the gascon and the unchanging countenance of porthos				390.6462912349057
you will excite your blood and that would produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy				47080.715516969445
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothing without reckoning mousqueton s wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more ay ay said athos exchanging a smile with d artagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good master in short said porthos when all my expenses are paid i shall have at most thirty crowns left and i about ten pistoles said aramis				242.81030078038987
well all that was useless				2354.721638436058
in fact at one of the doors which opened into the queen s apartment appeared the pretty mme				171.97405726091503
will you eat any of these beans cousin porthos said mme				25.54794075986709
all falsehood is a mask and however well made the mask may be with a little attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true face				946.0405048787638
d artagnan was looking at athos whose face betrayed all those emotions which the king possessing more self control had banished from his own				766.9548403142227
the breakfast chapter				265.06867847123414

caderousse s knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry the corpse was conveyed to the morgue				86465.13001911726
now said the deputy answer me frankly not as a prisoner to a judge but as one man to another who takes an interest in him what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter and villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter dantès had just given back to him				75.43233193574382
you may imagine there was something startling and ominous said haydée shaking her head and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the scene in this long file of slaves and women only half aroused from sleep or at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake				6740.011291977028
i should bombard the troops till not one grain of gunpowder was unexploded yes but after you had fired off your thirty thousand guns they would take the donjon the donjon being taken i should be obliged to let them hang you at which i should be most unhappy certainly and in his turn the duke bowed low to monsieur de chavigny				45966.41384661024
i could interpret one of your looks then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown instantly but on my part said milady how should i repay such a service				828.6849525097463
time was getting on however and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert but at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber his friend entered the room in perfect costume for the day				458.9680668909471
i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much				1633.7145163553132
a presentiment instantly told d artagnan that this carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous the young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently				2301.545989988333
inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this carriage contained the corpse of the marquis de saint méran and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two				1327.0793339125682
go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven o clock we will then terminate this conversation				1411.015172624128
i was at the end of my journey and of my credit				3212.1432736295706
is he still as stingy as ever				1657.8062087414457
i gad				84447.66979195032
don t you remember porthos we saw her at general cromwell s the roll call continued				3195.558435140201
therefore in my opinion my dear baron the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no one to blame but themselves danglars made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between himself and the baroness whose frowning brow like that of olympic jove predicted a storm				4255.755593994411
this child has caused me to recover what i had lost				1296.8847453020148
a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but i am content				15968.728849733961
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body				1453.8437780096733
true he might in such a case rely on the kindness of signor torlonia				27241.420227680363
but we must be going the two immediately started across country toward the road to paris followed by mousqueton who after being too cold all night at the end of a quarter of an hour found himself too warm				11426.438890939122
i think i understand his reason said morrel				81.73910306366736
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression				3205.1419962439045
will you sell him to me for that sum no but i will play for him what at dice no sooner said than done and i lost the horse				907.5867086317535

the unknown spurred his horse to a gallop				1431.8945027653258
ministers princes kings will pass away like mountain torrents civil war like a forest flame but we we shall remain i have a presentiment that we shall yes replied d artagnan let us still be musketeers and let us retain as our battle standard that famous napkin of the bastion st gervais on which the great cardinal had three fleurs de lis embroidered be it so cried aramis				293.32440546731556
he saw a lady a fashionable elegantly dressed lady and yet the door remained almost closed				2036.6138434675756
the matter had been named to him by d artagnan who in the first place pointed out the money to him then the glory and then the danger				3177.0467575717016
it may be supposed that dantès did not now think of his dinner but he insisted that his comrades who had not his reasons for fasting should have their meal				67258.11460735249
so my dear host be not uneasy and continue to take all the care of him that his situation requires monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator s wife and not to say a word of the wound that s agreed you have my word oh he would kill me don t be afraid he is not so much of a devil as he appears saying these words d artagnan went upstairs leaving his host a little better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be very much interested his debt and his life				530.107529666811
of the important cities given up by henry iv				1234.4237805573518
if my vote and interest can obtain it for him i will readily give him the one and promise the other				1016.4096385877821
charles having proceeded with aramis as with athos embraced them both				2825.970467437091
he was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment				828.7718895808135
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man so saying haydée arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act				2307.1311584638133
you must try to see her and have an explanation with her				246.46001373810762
monseigneur said marshal de grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son count de guiche and his traveling companion viscount de bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him what eagerly replied the prince will i permit				15697.410918933372
he hoped to meet with m de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs				2729.3623042468766
come athos said d artagnan giving his hand to the count you are going to see something curious added the gascon				1546.6422236215915
would you like me to send edward to you for a short time it had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by closing his eyes his refusal by winking them several times and if he had some desire or feeling to express he raised them to heaven				737.039570813137
morrel fell back in his chair his eyes fixed on the clock there were seven minutes left that was all				672.5262636030109
i have replied d artagnan				4.622721344275909
i will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be closed against me you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you wish me to do so yes well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron by whom are you charged by the baron himself oh said albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable				8380.499484207014
he was less stiff than formerly				20799.45921838564
friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that shall i take out any more of them asked porthos				165.732401867408
nothing nothing replied the priest go on it was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand that his writing might not be recognized and fernand who put it in the post but exclaimed the abbé suddenly you were there yourself i said caderousse astonished who told you i was there the abbé saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no one but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness true true said caderousse in a choking voice i was there and did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the abbé if not you were an accomplice sir replied caderousse they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception				93931.51177054232
besides i have lost nothing by this journey because i see you yes replied anne but you know why and how i see you because insensible to all my sufferings you persist in remaining in a city where by remaining you run the risk of your life and make me run the risk of my honor				3208.200115839436
well exclaimed the queen who remarked this movement and his paleness				7453.272963198431
i scarcely thought you were so curious as that i am always curious to see the downfall of your honor s enemies and he was not among the least of them				136.15501334771528
monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees said i confess how you obtained this animal benedetto maintained the truth of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his imagination than to his veracity				45708.32752613245
look said he to the procureur whose heart beat so loudly that it might almost be heard here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which m noirtier and barrois partook				50755.92069687474
she raised her head with an effort				5765.993890379436
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled				19320.670587274195
i may sacrifice my soul but what matters it added monte cristo				403.57886987493595
he assumed his costume and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own face				940.0113526841174
he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen				520.4344503744339
well monsieur said he you appear to be more stupid than i am for you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two ah said the englishman is it you my master				1485.626322349445
go away now mouston so he s called mouston thought d artagnan tis too long a word to pronounce mousqueton well he said aloud let us resume our conversation later your people may suspect something there may be spies about				3692.573440097387
the explosion would have done what the axe had failed to do				1130.6447535276882
i knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a woman				520.9064211379255
he s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head				537.4602178484665
this voice was that of my father				509.72310416326724
not yet replied porthos				12.106638155496782
he credited this woman who appeared to him the equal of a demon with agents as supernatural as herself at the least noise he imagined himself about to be arrested and that planchet was being brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends				537.6027289766379
thus for instance don t you in the first place want a horse yes a horse well then				906.5080191238399
hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel				55108.27305202085
but the count did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between lucien s visit and the curiosity of the baroness				1943.977956705799
what will that cost you my dear monsieur mordaunt yes the written order said porthos who now began to comprehend what d artagnan was aiming at we ask only for that however inclined mordaunt was to have recourse to violence he understood the reasons d artagnan had given him besides completely ignorant of the friendship which existed between the four frenchmen all his uneasiness disappeared when he heard of the plausible motive of the ransom				4294.725076603335
the young people felt a mutual esteem but the queen who at first sanctioned their affection changed her mind and monsieur the duc d orleans who had encouraged the familiarity between them has forbidden his daughter to think any more about the union				16649.91656548354
you do not madame at least i hope not				606.289848487585
they had reached the ladder which led to the boat				1548.3128172485692
it was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes fingers placed upon the lips little assassinating smiles which really did assassinate the disdained beauty				4368.881169045233
get up he continued his way toward the quai des grands augustins while the two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate porthos				308.731786952879
he is leaving them they are beating the rappel cried chatillon we must discover what is going on in fact they saw the soldiers running to their arms the trumpets sounded the drums beat the duc de beaufort drew his sword				1121.6304470039695
i accept it said she he has a right to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent putting the letter in her bosom she took her son s arm and with a firmer step than she even herself expected she went downstairs				1706.561739400282
but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything was explained to him by this letter dated from villeroy m d artagnan mm				10720.723568873333
a mousetrap in the seventeenth century chapter xi				4199.416887200455
this was not enough he must now learn to write				3677.0341009128615
monsieur porthos was six feet high this man is scarcely five nevertheless said d artagnan the people are bowing very low to this person as he spoke he rode toward the tall horse to the man of importance and his valets				11503.708798098536
nothing is lost then and now madame till i see you again				370.2783952147355
some minutes after the superior of the convent sent to inform the musketeers that the burial would take place at midday				15802.974980739184
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs what say you duke i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these never ending labors				16733.041415893942
not here he said doubtless she is in her bedroom he rushed towards the door found it bolted and stopped shuddering				3158.286883741799
the pharaon is entering the harbor morrel fell back in his chair his strength was failing him his understanding weakened by such events refused to comprehend such incredible unheard of fabulous facts				4726.676322799368
making a sign to la houdinière and cahusac to stop he alighted from his horse and went toward these suspected merry companions hoping by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge which concealed his approach to catch some words of this conversation which appeared so interesting				50452.75193284746
bring it to me or rather no no i may be found here therefore help me back to my room while i have the strength to drag myself along				8882.182626401285
the next day came and passed the day after a week i then wrote to the cardinal				297.51257851714456
ah those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels like mère simon s son who has not chosen the worst strawberries				87764.96594214553
and i have an idea of our leading a delightful life upon this francs child sighed mercédès				1421.9083183955454
the pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound that drew out of dantès forehead large drops of perspiration				4124.465738581345
it is singular said d artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i can not yet remember a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor				16791.75745571803
very well my lord it shall be so d artagnan saluted went out and hastened to repeat to his friend mazarin s flattering promises which gave porthos an indescribable happiness				1819.8525031438812
how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted son you have never spoken to me of either alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life				544.2049613002898
i am free then sir cried dantès joyfully				3477.0590265621763
more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard				1472.2176471607195
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formed a little fairy like figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue				5113.437078510091
it was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france				799.1936539047251
nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the count of monte cristo appeared on the threshold				2102.35632962402
clemency is a royal virtue employ it and you will find that you derive advantage therein thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen				503.7543829064427
yes let us go to the library please the marquis took his arm and they left the salon				3090.584919647904
ah gentlemen he cried as the two friends entered you are very happy				1492.1593585508124

danglars was joking in a friendly way but fernand looked pale and agitated were they alone there was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named caderousse but he was very drunk				8524.504588550508

i do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept secret mordaunt followed bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out				464.09068508717303
then he descended with cautious and slow step for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality				2635.0337969991865
well said morcerf for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppæa while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl				921.0214465527763

to the tender eye of a father or a lover the first glance would have sufficed to reveal valentine s condition but to this hireling valentine only appeared to sleep				1458.8381675488936
pronounce one single word muttered d artagnan and you are a dead man the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring				35379.519879074614
oh no it is as simple as possible replied monte cristo				129.77730343805334
beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream				1823.591234609978

on a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two dice boxes and dice				3243.872791478453
but the easy chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor and he soon made his appearance in the room				202.38910525120642
through this window shone a mild light which silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group outside the park				6907.239583401814
from what he has told me i know you now				1008.3464837154735
at this moment a horse neighed				51742.08716610199

then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden trees which were nearly divested of foliage madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the drawing room into the garden				1395.560874311476
i wish continued mazarin finishing as it were the speech this sudden movement of the queen had cut i wish in fact that you should now do for your husband what you formerly did for your lover again that accusation cried the queen				386.8951494511553

but peppino instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the count s hand and covered it with kisses				5240.382949274678
m the epistle is laconic said d artagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter				702.0306139106534
as if the catholic religion was not the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions				41968.00650290052

the queen breathed more freely				2565.2948957321214

lord wilmore resided in rue fontaine saint georges				27750.641935254473
but he was no longer there having withdrawn on the previous evening to la bassee misled by false intelligence of the enemy s movements				5753.755391813523
everything about the count seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the expression of his face and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be understood				2724.682361654479
besides maximilian morrel though hardly two and twenty had great influence over his father				582.0815318670838

yes yes she said softly to valentine let her leave but do you stay madame de villefort left and valentine remained alone beside the bed for the procureur overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death had followed his wife				1099.0946652486462
no by your brilliant and almost sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation				36249.34440380606
return to greenwich and bring them here				898.3742136085483
bonacieux knocked as at the shutter three light and regular taps				41096.96902806964
madame danglars in whom the events we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to madame de morcerf s when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort				507.7479876186553
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries				46901.36950499639
you speak first oh no				382.6802643027025
pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance				1505.7108876518212

they proceeded thus to peronne				86885.53815826874
here comes m morrel back				968.8109993399902
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem				45601.82855014672
true interrupted the young man i had not looked upon it in that light now replied monte cristo there is only one source of uneasiness left in your father s mind which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank				7534.58810392673
unfortunately he was an honorable man he married her				188.9856498311354

my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god				555.0998811883807
oh for pity s sake you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if morrel one of my friends had not stopped him listen to me my son has also guessed who you are he attributes his father s misfortunes to you madame you are mistaken they are not misfortunes it is a punishment				3570.677100998878
he found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery admiring himself before a glass				979.0300605405857
oh curses woe death to you he tried to follow monte cristo but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the spot his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living fire				2661.858348636513
they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother of pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the floor				1367.6647528249857
valentine we may easily conceive where morrel s appointment was				1032.8298638274034

everything that savors of mystery charms them				128.6040225052231
oh shall i then again become a fatalist whom fourteen years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence				1721.1229439033082
try again whispered the count who depended on the secret spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might be try again you have a few minutes work there and he advanced to the window				681.3450317512951
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that m danglars trembled too morrel morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this can not be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartism i mean about the year yes replied m danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner indeed answered maximilian and what did your father say then valentine oh such a dreadful thing that i don t dare to tell you always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile				553.6866384848811

he freed his weapon made a lunge and touched his adversary on the shoulder				721.8267863634162
provided charles is dead it is the axe not the man we must thank and yet without the man the king would have been rescued cromwell smiled				649.4536293677448
i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall see at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port				5501.173294842238

several strokes resounded on the door this time milady really pushed him away from her				247.02028599725472
valentine instantly ran down				983.2425055718463

i have however already told you sir i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter yes but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed said villefort				336.95491906558743
it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence				4581.435283275324

why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand and i have noticed that what that while the writing of different persons done with the right hand varies that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform you have evidently seen and observed everything let us proceed oh yes yes now as regards the second question i am listening was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage with mercédès yes a young man who loved her and his name was fernand that is a spanish name i think he was a catalan you imagine him capable of writing the letter oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me that is in strict accordance with the spanish character an assassination they will unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never besides said dantès the various circumstances mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him you had never spoken of them yourself to anyone to no one not even to your mistress no not even to my betrothed then it is danglars i feel quite sure of it now wait a little				1513.887814796323
as being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him i don t call those friends who betray and ruin you murmured the wife in her turn in a low muttering voice				570.9684236738187
no monseigneur				2541.4725198453907
the boat approached as near as it could to the shore but there was not depth enough of water for it to touch land				4564.183303345139
what someone is talking in the street it is the voice of of my husband				1464.7574189423565
at ten o clock milady began to appear restless				62945.107154292615
after a few minutes of silent embarrassment athos spoke				5026.849251802814
mazarin replied d artagnan bursting into a laugh				2388.5970311261135
he found the prisoner in the same position as if fixed there his eyes swollen with weeping				6606.452595492075
but i wonder she is not here				831.486533564461

suppose we warn the masters let s wait for grimaud but perhaps they have killed him grimaud would have cried out you know he is almost dumb we should have heard the blow then but if he doesn t return here he is at that very moment grimaud drew back the cloak which hid the aperture and came in with his face livid his eyes staring wide open with terror so that the pupils were contracted almost to nothing with a large circle of white around them				113.68601557967774
here i am exclaimed porthos				16.352186042959282
as she told the queen she had not seen her husband since his liberation she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the comte de rochefort who had become the best friend of bonacieux and had persuaded him without much trouble that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife but that it was only a political precaution				8155.11863129397
we can now part come i shall engage your passage and you my dear boy i shall stay here for a few days longer we must accustom ourselves to parting				67323.50741724439
both went into the bedroom and as the door of communication remained open d artagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid				2638.2838056482756
faith sir said raoul smiling although his pallor betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair you are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been long under any obligation to me				112.91593031589527
you are insane monsieur monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting and d artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to d artagnan to serve him as a safeguard				50543.772220824605
the opening of this door disclosed a brilliant light and she disappeared				1339.12141851209
the young man remained immovable				4335.928310911722
you have indeed a noble nature edmond and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment				722.4838070329032
in prison he had suffered his beard to grow his head fell on his shoulder his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious				7934.421768393269
what do you mean to say				827.6589942045712
the day passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage				8323.58091248257
the officer reappeared				2754.714661838441
but you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear not but cried the young officer speak then speak confide my shame to you cried milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another confide my shame to you a man and i a woman				479.06527088693076

so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize you dearest valentine said the young man the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love but yet i can not find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly i adore you				96.51213674708006
to wait at monte cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart which yearned to return to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank power and influence which are always accorded to wealth that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man				228.40565957122
the lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture such as became a man of good birth who had in the course of his life been frequently in the society of the highest nobles				61947.843767853374
the unfortunate barrois has been poisoned said d avrigny and i will maintain this assertion before god and man villefort said nothing but he clasped his hands opened his haggard eyes and overcome with his emotion sank into a chair				1023.2927443283806
and now remember one thing monsieur officer that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness i promised him to wait replied morrel and i will wait at this moment barrois entered				481.648513290314
the lady always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage it drove away sometimes towards the right hand sometimes to the left then about twenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief				4093.9146871241933
the ballet at length came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience				4683.671264786643
the reader may ask how came planchet here when he was left stiff as a rush in london				1612.0070711087303
even ali who had hastened to obey the count s summons went forth from his master s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over his patron s meditations whatever they were the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the door holding his breath lest its faintest sound should dissipate his master s happy reverie				2578.457454638818
at times there passed before me clouds which pressed my brow which veiled my eyes this was delirium				3646.0331041948016

my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious				43493.695889098424
he rose however as they approached				2819.1615406212236
close to the hedge the steps stopped				1128.6097410030968
ah my dear fellow said he to franz you did not see what there that calash filled with roman peasants no well i am convinced they are all charming women how unfortunate that you were masked albert said franz here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments oh replied he half laughing half serious i hope the carnival will not pass without some amends in one shape or the other but in spite of albert s hope the day passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of roman peasants				10263.557852675984
i pardon you said he for the poisoning of my brother and the assassination of his grace lord buckingham				2136.545299353166

should that diamond ever fall into my hands again he reflected i would turn it at once into money i would buy with the proceeds certain lands around my father s chateau which is a pretty place well enough but with no land to it at all except a garden about the size of the cemetery des innocents and i should wait in all my glory till some rich heiress attracted by my good looks rode along to marry me				112.64027063304287
after remaining for a short time in the parterre surrounding the house and gathering a rose to place in her waist or hair she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the gate				1671.5137754639898

midnight struck slowly and sadly every hour seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl				1008.8610892510405
certainly you must give the orders for i intend residing at the house it was unexampled for a servant of the count s to dare to dispute an order of his so the steward without saying a word followed his master who got into the carriage and signed to him to follow which he did taking his place respectfully on the front seat				1870.4513980263869
monsieur le lieutenant you have been very prompt				38182.50675907602
bonacieux addressing this epithet to her husband				1459.9084361978432
his air of perfect serenity made mazarin uneasy				2448.469378205475

we could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us aha				50788.36215423954

here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host for i now recollect you				149.3984756116998
go to the parliament for it was from this parliament the enemy of monarchs that the daughter of the great the sublime henry iv whom you so much admire received the only relief this winter which prevented her from dying of hunger and cold and with these words henrietta rose in majestic indignation whilst the cardinal raising his hands clasped toward her exclaimed ah madame madame how little you know me mon dieu but queen henrietta without even turning toward him who made these hypocritical pretensions crossed the cabinet opened the door for herself and passing through the midst of the cardinal s numerous guards courtiers eager to pay homage the luxurious show of a competing royalty she went and took the hand of de winter who stood apart in isolation				54117.37200614463
but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against you				179.18099744193017
monsieur porthos what do you say to that i say it is easy enough answered porthos				68.73633926045079
athos is so cool so brave and handles his sword so skillfully no doubt				1806.6178555502295
ah i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his heart hum said the major				1814.2397409696093

franz and albert descended the carriage approached the palace their excellencies stretched their legs along the seats the cicerone sprang into the seat behind				803.6318557835989

tis true				991.2821578842194
the regiment of the guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom and d artagnan followed by a lackey and traveling with four magnificent horses despite the simplicity of his uniform could not fail to make a sensation				12930.353875667377
egad cried d artagnan it s quite clear that the king and his escort have been by here the devil said porthos in that case they have eaten everything bah said d artagnan they will have left a chicken at least he dismounted and knocked on the door				332.0395148756734
we even have as you may have heard introduced a barrel of powder under one of the angles which in blowing up made a very pretty breach				7933.68025132784
it was for this she summoned you this morning and that she told you to return at five o clock was it worth while to wish me to swear this morning that i would mention the appointment to no one muttered d artagnan				160.81851437386453
he stooped and with the most gracious air he could assume drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it and holding it out to him said i believe monsieur that this is a handkerchief you would be sorry to lose the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered and had a coronet and arms at one of its corners				27058.931101796752

i feel the blood flowing towards my brain				3857.8670054325644
milady had told the truth her head was confused for her ill arranged plans clashed one another like chaos				42899.91068109501

it was not difficult to conquer as she had hitherto done men prompt to let themselves be seduced and whom the gallant education of a court led quickly into her net				32771.01670002945
providence appears to me to have no share in this affair and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find one both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last month				1337.6912082732038
bonacieux expected to see milady but she did not return				948.2404022038553
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our plans and we have fully ascertained beforehand that valentine s future husband will consent not to live in this house for that might not be pleasant for the young people but that you should live with them so that you and valentine who are so attached to each other would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you will be a gainer by the change as it will secure to you two children instead of one to watch over and comfort you noirtier s look was furious it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man s mind for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle				3522.6348691451935
the three friends were likewise greatly delighted				38092.74348455054

he was a man of forty to forty five years but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair which was cut short in the military fashion				4443.783688453403
in an instant he was placed in the stern sheets of the boat between the gendarmes while the officer stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the boat adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon				49919.29688412344
horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen garden and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation				82394.57714161655
aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them				113.75401489248722
whatever command she had over herself milady could not help starting and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister this start did not escape him				81.21635645617013
it is so hot at marseilles that really i believe that the respectable inhabitants will in time go without any clothing whatever				3857.506465710302
this famous invention of yours must i tell you replied the duke on what i most reckon and what i determine to try first yes that s the thing my lord cried his custodian gaily				42842.54876709975
if you do you know that my hand stretches far and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have from me no signature				6157.849821693485
i offer my best respects and services to you my lord d artagnan then returning to the officer said sir have the kindness also to awaken monsieur du vallon and to say tis by his eminence s order and that i shall await him at the stables the officer went off with an eagerness that showed the gascon that he had some personal interest in the matter				498.561594941687
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural ma foi said château renaud i would rather end my career like m de morcerf a pistol shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe and moreover it kills said beauchamp				590.4419332573333
oh my god				340.26421013992143
why here they give you their hand they press yours in return they keep up a whispering conversation permit you to accompany them home				1331.9170325830657
the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening				556.7803037629147
well said renée i can not help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own a physician for instance				41172.52435248252
i have already told you answered the abbé that i loathe the idea of shedding blood and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self preservation no matter				487.11508257647455
i can not help thinking that he has brought his son to france to choose a wife do you think so i am sure of it and you have heard his fortune mentioned nothing else was talked of only some said he was worth millions and others that he did not possess a farthing and what is your opinion i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression well and it is that my opinion is that all these old podestàs these ancient condottieri for the cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces my opinion i say is that they have buried their millions in corners the secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons who have done the same from generation to generation and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them certainly said danglars and this is further supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land very little at least i know of none which cavalcanti possesses excepting his palace in lucca ah he has a palace said danglars laughing come that is something yes and more than that he lets it to the minister of finance while he lives in a simple house				336.84808870793694
franz could even feel her arm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage				1411.3045168066676

franz and albert had brought to rome letters of introduction to them and their first question on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion				1290.5461967022527
whom do i see yonder where in the street facing your window in the embrasure of that door a man wrapped in a cloak it is he cried d artagnan and the citizen at the same time each having recognized his man				197.41307235434485

what could he say				833.8640704912265
in the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between the two kingdoms				6048.059939060112
m de tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning only when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual he informed him that the company of dessessart was on duty at the louvre and that he might repair at once to his post				2611.645764563224
come continued d artagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice				5908.407539997704
the third attack now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbé s meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to dantès all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a man could do in these days to his friends and then dantès countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies				1425.2460477554653
in march there was a question about a grant to a railway				27783.610521311162
at the time when he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for him but had consulted young maximilian s taste				1954.6859299568448
athos and aramis again questioned planchet but he had seen nothing of d artagnan they wished to take planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five o clock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis xiii				1040.901660694824
he was forced to confess to himself that this reasoning was not only comprehensive but just				10339.06551938178
what is your name i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat				53967.497033935266

a few dingy olives and stunted fig trees struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict				45978.339054057644

it is impossible to say whether charles who kept his eyes constantly closed had noticed the insolence of the puritan captain but the moment he heard the clear tone of d artagnan s voice his eyelids rose in spite of himself				367.7405711570951
i am going away the day after tomorrow do what you please monsieur chevalier				27789.94391033192
there to his great astonishment d artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into				61679.267987434694
richelieu and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can and he left the chamber without once looking behind him				74.28790202980996
well said he to the young girl are you willing my dear kitty that i should give you a proof of that love which you doubt what love asked the young girl				883.6823553248508
behind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps				1494.953965060516
it seemed to me as if you were yourself preparing for some dangerous undertaking about which i did not dare to question you since you told me nothing				471.90890305956185
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to d artagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly oh monsieur said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer				2053.774770794331
bonacieux shrugging her shoulders				1251.7072024238494
the young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity				7222.2033023801005
at eleven o clock albert had not come back				1158.5980468776388
for the rest the orders had been issued by the count he himself had given a plan to bertuccio marking the spot where each tree was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the paving stones				5614.91947284282
i don t see why we are very comfortable in those we wear to prevent recognition said d artagnan				11.201525308367735
silence child				791.4858869041875
the outlook was sad				7212.436365809321
why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited				5604.33765330138
i had a betrothed albert a lovely girl whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis painfully amassed by ceaseless toil				28200.82613667934
ecco said the guide and pushing danglars into the cell he closed the door upon him				85.45842453794774
he talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing himself talk				6089.377320870481
ah said d artagnan to himself can this be the seigneur du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds				5714.906009904946
then albert launched out in praise of mademoiselle danglars voice and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous evening				542.6724570296735
so you have seen the arm that was all				593.2157307414342
how sir she cried as d artagnan finished you dare to tell me the details of your crime to give me an account of your treason pardon madame but i think that either i have expressed myself badly or your majesty has imperfectly understood me				95.58871594596185
worthy fellows said morrel as he went away may your new master love you as i loved you and be more fortunate than i have been august rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of morrel to renew his credit or revive the old				2885.0638845475637
you must return to the rue des fossoyeurs i will accompany you but however near it may be replied d artagnan i can not go thither in this guise that s true said athos and he rang the bell				2339.448279421773
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared				940.9064503335526
i know it monsieur everything is turned topsy turvy in the world nowadays while this dialogue was going on the two young men and the poor lackey descended				5069.871287735303
athos bowed				1306.3466459644294
at these words madame morrel rose and threw herself into her son s arms				523.2649680905361
he no doubt thought that prisoners who died in the château d if were interred in an ordinary burial ground and he conveyed the dead man into his own cell took his place in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the moment of interment it was a bold step and one that showed some courage remarked the englishman				1454.456737303389
then valentine s attention was engrossed by the clock in her room which marked the seconds				4778.845865995862
one individual went from door to door bending under the weight of swords guns muskets and every kind of weapon which he deposited as fast as he could				5475.202513932116
but we must not lose time				292.44874292483433
come then and take it friend said the gascon				1045.5812241188296
de salvieux my brother s chamberlain yes sire he is at marseilles and writes me thence does he speak to you of this conspiracy no but strongly recommends m de villefort and begs me to present him to your majesty m				566.9431732526825
we owe nothing to our enemies and let me give you a piece of advice take care of yourself monsieur d artagnan for from the moment i withdraw my hand from behind you i would not give an obolus for your life i will try to do so monseigneur replied the gascon with a noble confidence				8858.808864686482
as a punishment for the crime i had committed answered bertuccio				1731.8036496285426
i have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron s heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some manfred some lara some werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society you say i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag				25530.394677623863
how much do you want all you have in gold i have five hundred pistoles or thereabouts i have as much				1572.5602165769521
the news caused a great sensation throughout the house madame de villefort would not believe it and valentine was thunderstruck				14322.291500975318
ma foi i should wish to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my fellow creatures				4599.656018745111
speak then i am all ears d artagnan related his adventure with mme				220.59668480937262
he shouted again				335.42846233794825
then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort do not be in such a hurry to do that said valentine with a sad smile				439.34928015588156
it was five o clock in the afternoon i ascended into the red room and waited for night				1147.4453679207907
well then it appears that we are the crœsuses of the society				3214.0798871486013
he was desirous of an explosion because in that case the mine throws forth fire and fire enlightens				51447.6470426965
oh oh he at length muttered do you see what				528.5018121347764
nothing but one word said d artagnan				5.739115789362234
he were a dead man said the gascon if there were still a vitry at the court and if vitry entered at this moment but for my part before he could reach the good prelate i would kill vitry at once the cardinal would be infinitely pleased with me hush said porthos listen madame cried the cardinal seizing hold of anne and drawing her back madame what are you about then he added in spanish anne are you mad				1378.167370165789
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not everyone who likes to be made the centre of observation and the subject of unpleasant remark i agree with you monsieur said the young man turning pale and in spite of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his companion such consequences would be extremely unpleasant nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said monte cristo for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another				694.7220708475733
we will divide our regiments into two squadrons				33262.61869267429
everything is ready is it not yes the cargo on board yes five full casks and fifty empty ones good we are carrying port wine to anvers excellent				6188.2506385729
the day passed away in utter silence night came without recurrence of the noise				2179.3789604733843
how badly				23717.10320775054
and then there are robbers said la carconte				3619.5643888698614
you must dress him up during my absence				2982.7836639694597
we have a precious fellow here monsieur grimaud said the duke for your sake i beg of you never come within the reach of my fist hush				7116.454174905672
the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum				53509.58937794953
here said caderousse draw me all that on the paper my boy andrea took the pen with an imperceptible smile and began				2501.498027545949
steps sounded in the chamber and drew near				3376.0129229405316
debray maximilian morrel and m de château renaud did they speak of me not a word so much the worse why so				558.4780631938798
over a species of altar and beneath a canopy of blue velvet surmounted by white and red plumes was a full length portrait of anne of austria so perfect in its resemblance that d artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it				96.33323671196699
there was something melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the middle of the night but each of those strokes which made up the expected hour vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man				229.7103291160769
no was the old man s reply i will not leave this house for my poor dear boy loves me better than anything in the world and if he gets out of prison he will come and see me the first thing and what would he think if i did not wait here for him i heard all this from the window for i was anxious that mercédès should persuade the old man to accompany her for his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment s repose but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man asked the abbé				954.9272963725249
you have committed the first wrong since it was you who suspected the queen what				617.9572362874982
d artagnan who never turned his head did not perceive it				87.50904445027189
at three paces from her seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old worm eaten table was a tall young man of twenty or two and twenty who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled				9677.07562630486
yes among your friends of other times among those who aided you to contend against the duc de richelieu and even to conquer him what is he aiming at murmured the queen looking uneasily at the cardinal				286.98338008236914
you are welcome sir most welcome repeated the astonished caderousse				240.5498446630192
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of				2002.1184738355307
in business sir said he one has no friends only correspondents it is true murmured the englishman then you have but one hope but one the last the last so that if this fail i am ruined completely ruined as i was on my way here a vessel was coming into port i know it sir a young man who still adheres to my fallen fortunes passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the house in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me he has informed me of the arrival of this ship and it is not yours no she is a bordeaux vessel la gironde she comes from india also but she is not mine perhaps she has spoken to the pharaon and brings you some tidings of her shall i tell you plainly one thing sir				364.5565343885792
porthos foamed with rage and made a movement to rush after d artagnan				141.84031753986483
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond				1245.0443392488412
you a deputy procureur to found an accusation on such bad premises				38968.799273726654
the duke came straight up to him and said monsieur de tréville his majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hôtel				1790.5399868489314
but yourself monsieur said athos who began to be annoyed by this inquisition give me i beg you the proof that you have the right to question me your name repeated the cavalier a second time letting his cloak fall and leaving his face uncovered				7622.596489866112
and you said athos you forget that you committed a very different kind of imprudence in pronouncing lord de winter s name				921.6285895394847
if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the contrary he appeared his noble countenance his brilliant eyes his amiability his polite attention even towards madame danglars soon dispelled every impression of fear				1017.8690329169592
i don t know what it was				1036.770400263608
in one was depicted the illustrious coxcomb receiving a shower of blows from cardinal bentivoglio whose servant he had been another the illustrious mazarin acting the part of ignatius loyola in a tragedy of that name a third the illustrious mazarin stealing the portfolio of prime minister from monsieur de chavigny who had expected to have it a fourth the illustrious coxcomb mazarin refusing to give laporte the young king s valet clean sheets and saving that it was quite enough for the king of france to have clean sheets every three months the governor of course thought proper to threaten his prisoner that if he did not give up drawing such pictures he should be obliged to deprive him of all the means of amusing himself in that manner				1032.3542264401458
the lackey bowed and let them pass				2190.8371562817024
d artagnan				18.92759479303968
great heavens suddenly exclaimed debray				609.6509739542058
well signor pastrini said franz now that my companion is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this luigi vampa				5451.173561704384
who sent you come come you are going on quickly m benedetto yes and to the point				1233.9506214837763
d artagnan searched his pockets and took from one of them the order for the passage				2239.6985192556926
but there are no more said she				52.80440926566292
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i will say to you you are a magistrate do as you will i thank you doctor said villefort with indescribable joy i never had a better friend than you and as if he feared doctor d avrigny would recall his promise he hurried him towards the house				350.459719579492
i want air that is all will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase				1127.8694715126087
then unfastening the diamond ornament which the queen had sent him he placed it in the hands of the priest who accompanied juxon				12888.532072166036
the prisoner glanced at the windows they were grated he had changed his prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither				37949.15562702478
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont i think ah said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter you wring my heart and who is this cavalier henrietta asked the queen				409.31650067010486
still further the sea very rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast destroyed every day some little vessel and the shore from the point of l aiguillon to the trenches was at every tide literally covered with the wrecks of pinnacles roberges and feluccas				50236.50451074392
i should make an excellent gambler if i were not too hot headed but i was hot headed just as if i had been drinking				6297.41959754051
ghosts at first sight the exterior of the house at auteuil gave no indications of splendor nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent count of monte cristo but this simplicity was according to the will of its master who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside				4555.916232351349
the baron appears thoughtful today said monte cristo to her are they going to put him in the ministry not yet i think				3505.954521833425
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket				6552.446966606888
bonacieux retired				747.5286644892091
mazarin was desirous of setting out instantly for saint germain but the queen declared that she should wait for the people whom she had appointed to meet her				228.55677090410535
alas poor albert				891.576001123618
baron danglars follow me said the man				155.5870602828912
he took monte cristo aside				5426.225347645584
however the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness				12569.550668771259
it was the king who was passing through the streets which led from the louvre to the hôtel de ville and which were all illuminated with colored lanterns				10496.29501757264
at last louis xiii				992.882998794489
everything d artagnan even folly has its limit then your means it appears are improved you have a capital house your own i presume				67559.93808027511
you will excuse us sir but we are told that a battle is expected and we do not wish to arrive the day after it go my young sirs said the sick man and may you both be blessed for your piety				119483.80146386907
nevertheless rapid as the movement had been d artagnan had had time to get a glimpse of the head of an old man				234.00796831097202
i am endeavoring he thought to make this man happy i look upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought				32320.907201809234
yes with frenchmen and frenchmen like you and monsieur du vallon added the other				961.4962798911369
the concert must be a delightful one they suit each other remarkably well said danglars				193.60555883493905
the first object that met the eyes of d artagnan on entering the room was brisemont stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible convulsions				25464.449081319242
well said athos				9.958209661997754
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawing room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by signs				14692.042537008474
if you will only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure anything ah maximilian that is the very thing that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my stepmother and her blind preference for her own child or to be as i now am insensible to any pleasure save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both i will not admit that word returned the young man it is at once cruel and unjust				8485.73353265361
besides his presenting you the cup under the name of lord ruthven oh but that is dreadful				15717.76863408061
grimaud took advantage of that instant to draw from his vest a charming little note with an aristocratic seal and presented it to the duke without a word				643.9289698018397
simpleton exclaimed mousqueton suppose any one came into the room ah true cried blaisois with evident admiration but it will be dark in the cellar grimaud always sees dark or light night as well as day answered mousqueton				1538.691865938117
besides were not those riches chimerical offspring of the brain of the poor abbé faria had they not died with him				83.36859302755943
well if you know them you know that they are good and free companions				908.8560474425395
here is a glass with one already prepared said villefort entering the room				202.50089080693206
d artagnan and planchet spurred their steeds and took the road to paris				462.7528928993696
the brother did not perceive this he had turned round to play with milady s favorite monkey which had pulled him by the doublet				10460.799484349905
you know my dear count said he the ceremony is to take place this evening				511.92481898439945
he was very taciturn this worthy signor				50753.98454908509
have you not let it go out of your hands no d avrigny took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his hand and swallowed them				139.77405652553588
whilst he thus hesitated the host re entered the room followed not only by a surgeon but by many other persons whom curiosity had attracted to the spot				2094.556490183313
i set off for france after having fixed upon the plan				2600.4270925056885
the envoy presented his letter of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly then began the questions which were similar to those which had been addressed to the abbé busoni				4636.898853181312
the evening of the betrothal chapter				346.03600669494256
what a pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead				474.5651044923165
i found my knife where i had placed it under my pillow and while feigning to sleep my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively				11090.368223785454
d artagnan i am your prisoner treat me as such ah				345.81250007881135
bonacieux prophesied				49741.89684670876
here i am your excellency said peppino with an eagerness which danglars thought favorable to him				72.27804654547876
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthos s long cloak and d artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it				91.36766346508263
chapter lxxx				57236.08540747958
the spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its muzzle in order to strike raoul on the head with the butt				23960.99884202034
prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no				680.688744069739
scarcely was the captain s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the island of elba instead of making for marseilles direct as to taking command of the vessel replied morrel that was his duty as captain s mate as to losing a day and a half off the island of elba he was wrong unless the vessel needed repairs the vessel was in as good condition as i am and as i hope you are m morrel and this day and a half was lost from pure whim for the pleasure of going ashore and nothing else dantès said the shipowner turning towards the young man come this way in a moment sir answered dantès and i m with you then calling to the crew he said let go the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port hole				2482.6621142942568
guitant and comminges at the head of the guards marched first then came the royal carriage with d artagnan on one side porthos on the other then the musketeers for two and twenty years staunch friends of d artagnan				239.81240405555943
ah ha said the shipowner i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three times inquiring if there were any news of the pharaon				1314.0259959357443
the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale				27830.25700665957
he had gone down about three quarters of the length of the wall when the cord broke				27306.60257024188
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly				48527.38775802064
why people jest with death and people are wrong d artagnan for death is the door which leads to perdition or to salvation granted but if you please let us not theologize aramis				266.00831428465335
from being slender he had now become meagre once pale he was now yellow his deep set eyes were hollow and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an integral portion of his face				941.1792746478544
dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria who having also been visited by his jailer had come to invite his fellow sufferer to share his supper				1674.0989788203835
oh man man race of crocodiles cried the count extending his clenched hands towards the crowd how well do i recognize you there and that at all times you are worthy of yourselves meanwhile andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground and he kept exclaiming he ought to die he shall die i will not die alone look look cried the count seizing the young men s hands look for on my soul it is curious				29640.923603132727
they all rushed towards him for all loved edmond in spite of his superiority yet jacopo reached him first				1019.9625896482688
what shall we do				692.490258198838
when d artagnan had finished he said hum				128222.86402731483
pray was danglars acquainted with fernand no yes he was				1043.195292165134
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob				84987.0404740997
or solitary confinement				8865.81537290697

d artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron				2399.860600926007
as soon as she saw him she seized his hand her own hands were moist and icy cold				2055.942160904851
well pardieu there is yours my dear friend replied d artagnan				4.759900091528017
athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier				10709.952804047889
really honest men are not so scarce as i thought don t be in a hurry to weave crowns for our scotchman				2723.1354182756704

why do you not apply to them if you stand in need of help that is to say stammered milady i am not really very intimate with any of them				131.30382143566425
to be sure yes				1013.8659287080022
this time said athos first breaking the silence d artagnan has given us an excellent program and the letter must be written at once the devil				691.053707151558
m de morcerf approached her				147.2968237996937
gentlemen said the president when silence was restored is the count of morcerf convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this house yes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice				608.2722715283747
then my brother determined to substitute cunning for force				1703.8768443909566
he related to athos all that had passed except the letter to m de wardes				2719.5150339349057

without caring about them myself i live among those who are much occupied in them				140.0806465691437
noirtier paler than even the young girl more eager than villefort for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately				23683.900052995235
our bark flew before the wind				3447.3560503552867
then a sudden idea crossed the mind of d artagnan				174.21999705223269
then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act then one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance yet conscience remains remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh				678.6977807416228
come come said the old man be comforted my poor child there is still hope hope repeated danglars				428.3296593605691
i breathe more freely in fact porthos breathed so loud as to do credit to the free play of his powerful lungs				39204.75599125203
i have met him several times at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in paris				459.74302241707215
the princes and princesses were invited and their carriages had crowded the court since noon then after dinner the queen was to have a play in her apartment				769.0866103394029
is he prosperous and happy he died a more wretched hopeless heart broken prisoner than the felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse who turned away and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head				541.4849853303162
i have just made m de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned				731.3537510083569
it was this that made me start when you said the other day at m de morcerf s that messrs thomson french were your bankers				11867.642002780434
speak now the queen herself releases you from your promise the queen said d artagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended				38850.42771904336
it is his way and you must take him as you find him at this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act				2305.909242321014
from this moment vampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and everything served him for a mark the trunk of some old and moss grown olive tree that grew on the sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their heads and thus he soon became so expert that teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand				291.1797163687339
the englishman delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a kind disposition pressed d artagnan in his arms and paid a thousand compliments to the three musketeers and as porthos s adversary was already installed in the carriage and as aramis s had taken to his heels they had nothing to think about but the dead				494.94955709059167
there were sentinels a guard in the court stacks of arms and horses saddled				36773.4106693596
general d épinay died five minutes after franz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his hand over his eyes as if to dispel a cloud but after a moment s silence he continued the president went up the steps after pushing his sword into his cane a track of blood on the snow marked his course				1823.825160193068
friend d artagnan continued he speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself if you escape of which there is not much chance i would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future				1626.9953383024538
what is that he inquired				4899.437898562683
oh he exclaimed as though a red hot iron were piercing his heart				446.81141353714224
remember raoul this				1048.0875531567715
what does he want with me said monte cristo				107.73727302514138
he is quite a child and tis a child he loves athos became thoughtful				3731.318250598491
do you know said porthos that to twist that damned milady s neck would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of huguenots who have committed no other crime than singing in french the psalms we sing in latin what says the abbé asked athos quietly				1454.6238898107806
one morning he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all day leaving the kind hearted assunta who loved him as if he were her own child to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence				2764.172660886621
i have my sword and no one waiting for you outside no then you had better come with me thank you sir but the way by the subterranean passage would take too much time and i have none to lose cromwell placed his hand on a hidden handle and opened a door so well concealed by the tapestry that the most practiced eye could not have discovered it				84.221177789928
tréville had grasped the weak side of his master and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships				15474.721792239578
the servants standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at noirtier s old servant who had heard the noise from his master s room and run there also remaining behind the others				689.0836837704283
monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling ali a horse for m de morcerf quick				4238.056397808072
to fight that was to disobey the law that was to risk his head that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself				378.73950256591314
so he was called the queen s invalid with a pension of fifteen hundred francs				761.8050545920769
then he went to call on monte cristo and heard still more				1153.7685681144185
this evening said the governor				1457.282876812289
indeed count said madame danglars i am ashamed to own it but all your frightful stories have so upset me that i must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a chair				1028.9641618613875
maximilian goes with me said the count in his kindest and most persuasive manner therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brother s account once more farewell my dear sister emmanuel adieu morrel repeated				1381.7245676302182
raoul mounted his horse and both leisurely took their way to the rue tiquetonne				7302.989100091695
nevertheless you ought to remember that that great that sublime monarch when proscribed at one time as my husband may be demanded aid from england and england accorded it to him and it is but just to say that queen elizabeth was not his niece peccato said mazarin writhing beneath this simple eloquence your majesty does not understand me you judge my intentions wrongly and that is partly because doubtless i explain myself in french speak italian sir				312.25724240467366
it was her practice to pass hours either in her oratory or in her room without either reading or praying				8001.221609508303
tis true thought the gascon where has he heard it				70.59665779360701

how many shots a hundred that s quite as many as we shall want				2080.6650313526766
m villefort i beg to remind you my mother speaks to you if the marquise will deign to repeat the words i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to answer said m de villefort				387.97404911968897
accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following				12645.49066719296
he can not acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through m cavalcanti and gives him fifty thousand francs for it fifty thousand francs for being your father				536.0619767022696
the storm increased the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly the thunder began to growl and the wind the precursor of a hurricane whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen				1150.7949422646125
they have allowed all this time to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up events which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in order to tarnish the lustre of our high position				1260.3586133003457
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself				1099.9162198848103
the fact was that emery s son had run a great chance of being suffocated one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he gave up all the gold he had swallowed				16174.86232576299
athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen bonacieux undergo				57427.72448727767
i recognize grimaud by his long legs and his determined slouch				24742.594457855143
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him off				1226.3988466048925
faith you are indeed right not to return to it				86.88598555759569
i wish to see him at once ah said the jailer do not always brood over what is impossible or you will be mad in a fortnight you think so yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a million of francs to the governor for his liberty that an abbé became mad who was in this chamber before you how long has he left it two years was he liberated then no he was put in a dungeon listen said dantès				513.5088193951302
one plays with anybody but one fights only with equals and that is but just said athos and he took aside the one of the four englishmen with whom he was to fight and communicated his name in a low voice				607.6657961211118
fortunately we have the great cardinal his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates to the bottom of the heart bonacieux was repeating word for word a sentence which he had heard from the comte de rochefort but the poor wife who had reckoned on her husband and who in that hope had answered for him to the queen did not tremble the less both at the danger into which she had nearly cast herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced				54639.59176327159
what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church				1571.046987575202
with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the return of madame de saint méran and the death of the marquis that something would occur at m de villefort s in connection with his attachment for valentine				941.263650808893
we hope that the reader has not quite forgotten the young traveler whom we left on the road to flanders				4095.015836871016
we can therefore use up four horses as well as one				976.7838829569462
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks				52894.15329814954
edmond made great exertions in order to comply but at each effort he fell back moaning and turning pale				822.1086612876966
no no my boy i prefer remaining honorably in the capital andrea scowled				40561.156015254186
then did you not observe the agitation in the palais royal the passing to and fro of busy people				1152.2516754584815
i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which				9104.557746604234
what shall we do yes why the same we had intended doing three days since set off what although you are not now going to be married you intend still listen louise				10024.970988098614
she then replaced the bonnet and saw with pleasure in a little pocket mirror that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible				3171.8245321417676
he perceived his mistake but the friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial and one of them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness				29956.30554731353
the young man turned round thinking that danglars or monte cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting				6857.808672904687
write my lord he said				333.2122640512058
no i grieve not on my own account i shall always find a resource my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which i shall be able to procure will remain my own				731.0141603825721
caderousse entered hastily				9868.352924751478
the man who had the appearance of being a butcher descended a little steep and isolated street looking on to the river with two of his friends				611.4720433881536
how perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room				204.27596230488254
you are right father i understand you then extending his hand towards one of the pistols he said there is one for you and one for me thanks morrel caught his hand				264.5596712032272
oh m d avrigny i beseech you do something for her where is she in her room with the notary and m noirtier just as he was his mind perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking and the same love for you eh my dear child yes said valentine he was very fond of me who does not love you valentine smiled sadly				3391.780678308197
the queen had confidence in the courage of d artagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced				38816.80028592368
alas murmured he with intense suffering i might then have been happy yet then he carried haydée to her room resigned her to the care of her attendants and returning to his study which he shut quickly this time he again copied the destroyed will				1790.5656009121064
to you my preserver perhaps				2422.122271265447
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud				6340.549324154013

there was a great deal going on that morning and many business like persons at the palais business like persons pay very little attention to women and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer				26218.512883121446

why of downright starvation starvation exclaimed the abbé springing from his seat				1705.1333888812842
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well this is a council of state d artagnan remarked to porthos but we held better ones at la rochelle with athos and aramis at the saint gervais bastion said porthos				213.50257456511608
supper was served				1080.6306275307418
standing before the chimney was a man of middle height of a haughty proud mien with piercing eyes a large brow and a thin face which was made still longer by a royal or imperial as it is now called surmounted by a pair of mustaches				42441.65959276346
is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words				709.4157052744683
porthos ventured to put his head between the railings to try if his glance could penetrate the gloom				2743.5419912465863
one opposite to me the other with his back to me good				1433.2142425134195

aha cried d artagnan they re coming toward us so much the worse for them said porthos				34.35614286264637
science becomes in their hands not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive one the one serves against all their physical sufferings the other against all their enemies				1441.2249237682793
oh i would advance ten millions on his signature				5934.0558404417725
d artagnan went last still shaking his head				508.8008169863639
planchet and bazin came last				1151.050684351402

at them echoed de guiche				1414.3239598446262
he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion				1817.5890236346477
tis enough to kill the body without killing the soul bazin made a despairing sign which meant that while perhaps he approved the moral he altogether disapproved the tone in which it was uttered				2426.896947326224
now then what do you say to that alas				1173.0503658138
why my good fellow you must be mad then in a suppressed tone as if speaking to himself this is annoying continued he				576.2376577924175

danglars immediately advanced towards the door and opened it				93.8129288719123
the king who was entirely surrounded walked alone in a great empty space				6286.312876253501
well cried milady in a sharp voice				530.740856207435
fortunately the affair was not managed so secretly but that it became known to the queen				545.7074440807389
the door immediately closed and d artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity				1173.5717996016638
younger sons he said who enlisted in the musketeers under feigned names in order not to lower their family names				5254.139427340972

porthos as we have seen had a character exactly opposite to that of athos				323.9844232944753

the carmelite convent at béthune chapter lxii				11011.263732987063
then an idea crossed my mind which was confirmed when i saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box two feet long and six or eight inches deep				5844.876650511172
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself and the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in paris				411.47223088816696
poor athos said he he will never guess what all this means				1736.1477809280257
d artagnan therefore returned to the rue férou				8783.986400535987
never was there an apartment at the same time more warlike and more elegant				47113.18917190336
i come for your commands my lord he said				382.80126512901035

charles returned in silence to his chair rested his elbow on the table bowed his head upon his hand and reflected				1792.98778402023
the conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man				252.9084710905599
i am completely ignorant nor does it much disquiet me you re in the wrong there for if you knew my name perhaps you would not be so pressing what is your name bernajoux at your service well then monsieur bernajoux said d artagnan tranquilly i will wait for you at the door go monsieur i will follow you do not hurry yourself monsieur lest it be observed that we go out together				596.0750334909417

however a few instants after she had finished her religious song milady thought she heard a profound sigh				683.3349630802796
the cardinal folded and sealed his letter				708.7154819596866
in a word the island was inhabited yet edmond felt himself alone guided by the hand of god				580.4359997417052
they stopped him at the door				336.9859303093689

don quixote took windmills for giants and sheep for armies d artagnan took every smile for an insult and every look as a provocation whence it resulted that from tarbes to meung his fist was constantly doubled or his hand on the hilt of his sword and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw nor did the sword issue from its scabbard				2948.17235243074
haydée said he you well know why do you address me so coldly so distantly asked the young greek				4512.738706196137
the point of the sword had touched a rib and glanced along the bone				13365.792840682832

we will arm our four lackeys with pistols and musketoons if they send an army out against us we will give battle and the survivor as d artagnan says will carry the letter well said cried aramis you don t often speak athos but when you do speak it is like st john of the golden mouth				2670.16216491625

this way				675.263739773089
the inquiries soon commenced				3390.4611961486457
you are among friends said athos in english so cheer up and tell us if you have the strength to do so what has happened the king muttered the wounded man the king is a prisoner you have seen him asked aramis in the same language				931.2784708767418
but d artagnan stopped his hand and in a hoarse voice cried wait athos stopped				1052.6051606234003
no i shall go incognito count under the name of marie michon you are adorable madame but do not keep raoul with you why not because he is in love he				487.06630735853247
during this passage felton related everything to milady how instead of going to london he had chartered the little vessel how he had returned how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the interstices of the stones as he ascended to give him foothold and how when he had reached the bars he fastened his ladder				2018.1792434377717
the baron took the young officer by the arm and turned his head over his shoulder so as not to lose sight of milady till he was gone out				424.25732750323135
be content i will depart but you will not follow me you will not watch me i will return home instantly ah i was quite sure you were a good and brave young man said mme				84.50067072396236

it was ali my nubian slave who rendered this service to madame de villefort was it ali asked the count of morcerf who rescued my son from the hands of bandits no count replied monte cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your thanks but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debt if indeed there existed one and i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject				1711.1174972314507

an intervening elevation of land hid the light				1433.1192516983642
there was no more to do in the room so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of death so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust				5412.085408621053
at length m de tréville himself returned				744.4879358623714
we shall go out all the same do you know my dear fellow why master pastrycooks never work with their hands no said porthos but i should be glad to be informed it is because in the presence of their pupils they fear that some of their tarts or creams may turn out badly cooked what then why then they would be laughed at and a master pastrycook must never be laughed at and what have master pastrycooks to do with us we ought in our adventures never to be defeated or give any one a chance to laugh at us				389.51445272335025

as happy as it is allowed to one of god s creatures to be on this earth but say out all you think d artagnan for you have not yet done so you are too bad athos one can hide nothing from you answered d artagnan				113.48112507577798
just reflect a little what an agitation the queen s mind must be in for her to have remembered me after twenty years it is true said porthos				168.9662904431848
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy				1509.0474370362676
now said d artagnan i am going to call this soldier and talk to him				72.42726086870042
and you assisted and took part in this great battle bragelonne cried the former musketeer				1952.3413248876907
in the midst of her despair a new affliction overtook her				228.52004612521299
sire continued m de blacas if it only be to reassure a faithful servant will your majesty send into languedoc provence and dauphiné trusty men who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling in these three provinces canimus surdis replied the king continuing the annotations in his horace				33015.79252147261

silence said d artagnan pressing her hand still more warmly				5254.294762509745
the face of this young woman was covered with a black velvet mask but notwithstanding this precaution which was in fact taken rather against others than against him he at once recognized his usual guide the light and intelligent mme				196.37506662538794
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when peppino stopped the baron s right hand with his left and held out his other hand				291.79851226411034

leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony arms as he passed the count reached the tower of montlhéry situated as everyone knows upon the highest point of the plain of that name				958.5093655592186
the four others were french and wore the uniform of musketeers their names asked the monk				3498.7399114352897
in his youth d artagnan had often headed the bourgeoisie against the military but he was cured of all those hot headed propensities besides he had the cardinal s hundred pistoles in his pocket so he went into the hotel without a word				650.8434259774672
the dark space frightened her				151.8257089839736
etiquette had no minutiæ unknown to him				74.53382661284853
m de villefort was therefore obliged to request m d avrigny to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city more especially a death under such suspicious circumstances				1781.6468075646526
the count s tutor a man of the world and a bon vivant up to his eyes in learning as his pupil described him often recalled the profound erudition the witty and caustic satire of athos to raoul but as regarded grace delicacy and nobility of external appearance no one in these points was to be compared to the comte de la fere				1737.5946545174893
the letter is still to be seen for it is in franz d épinay s possession signed by me and with a postscript of m luigi vampa				3923.7127901634667
i see no one and yet the ladder didn t come down of itself no it is bazin ah				359.713123704336
that will do replied the cardinal				196.9805310201589
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required i know it said athos coolly since here it is and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels				20553.629216330966
if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape patience said the abbé in a tone which made the dying man shudder have patience caderousse looked at him with amazement				1413.035090432759

is he at home yes monsieur said mousqueton but in a very ill humor				2123.9688926355816
his guards taking him by the arms and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress while the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind				818.8020439066429
i am tired of hearing only of market reports of the end of the month of the rise and fall of spanish funds of haitian bonds				3311.4032945837534
only we conspire against the rochellais ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his eminence				1310.4237421044388
d artagnan followed but less nimbly showing plainly that this mode of ascent was not one to which he was accustomed				20662.76489251884
danglars looked radiant with joy the banker accompanied him to the door				360.32323890348835
he called for d artagnan but in the midst of such tumult he little expected to see him d artagnan not being on service				871.8060158795549
noirtier resumed m d avrigny in the same pitiless tone m				681.247896377984
the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the room				195.0400268636091
she ran therefore to debray who after having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of conversation for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the world				710.5044347216746
i wish my life to be free and open				986.0290510602135
yield you yield to me do you not a giant had seized also aramis s two wrists who struggled in vain to release himself from this formidable grasp				3871.2269993018062
perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i say that you are very culpable d artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis				270.4582340008001
i have been the cause of all your misfortunes but why do you pity instead of blaming me				92.87205751065532
yes we must put the madman with the madmen the soldiers seized dantès who followed passively				30070.138441434166
we must not do so no you do not sanction our project no there is another way said morrel				191.59695672580247
there can be no doubt we would all be broken on the wheel but for god s sake do not forget as you yourself said athos that we only write to him concerning a family affair that we only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he will put it out of her power to injure us				491.14396346363856
d artagnan alone had discovered nothing he ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed him				63.96043166926547
two broke from the heat of the fire the other ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea				1097.5031116855412
you see said athos				10.235200860440358
everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba a return which was unprecedented in the past and will probably remain without a counterpart in the future				1616.9078261450823
yes you have a recipe for it an infallible one that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink yes said monte cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed may we inquire what is this recipe asked debray				848.1789023149535
come instantly pray come madame madame cried valentine calling her step mother and running upstairs to meet her come quick quick and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you what is the matter said madame de villefort in a harsh and constrained tone				743.1061416816806
not one of these glances nor one sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho				34646.778036786556
she is amiable and well behaved what is her name she was sent to me by someone of high rank under the name of kitty				1990.4453403323284
indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does				3348.8589989771654
that woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn				815.4196809362414
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped				6658.261295572492
yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate in four days said morrel it is extraordinary indeed said château renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too				1493.845894789708
we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us				492.60564173685447

d artagnan let me confess to you what i ve been thinking about during the whole of my drive as i looked out upon the parties of citizens who perpetually crossed our path and looked at you and your four men with fiery eyes speak out answered d artagnan				126.16790290440315
at length i heard the well known noise of the door which opened and shut i heard notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet a step which made the floor creak i saw notwithstanding the darkness a shadow which approached my bed haste				1350.6788262942368
and this conviction restored his strength				1349.9917956232546

monte cristo went to the window and saw them crossing the street arm in arm				1197.2595181442762
the clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down				1363.6267226537013
morrel had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed nothing				542.9416408176447
i left him about five minutes ago and he is now occupied in dictating his will to two notaries but to do this he must have spoken he has done better than that he has made himself understood how was such a thing possible by the help of his eyes which are still full of life and as you perceive possess the power of inflicting mortal injury my dear said madame de villefort who had just entered the room perhaps you exaggerate the evil good morning madame said the count bowing				2586.6404683121564
is it to make me a captain				744.1085380895352
but putting his head out of the carriage eh				3508.4061925727365

already the sound of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht				3356.116598169461
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he wishes to discover if the fine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank entitles you sir exclaimed the young man quite astounded i hope no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my friend wilmore the philanthropist				17876.14769700799
in a blue frock coat buttoned up close decorated with the legion of honor it is he said villefort turning pale				658.528550654571
i was not deceived said he here is monsieur d artagnan and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and aramis the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment				652.0126184906777

he was her grandfather on the mother s side				1495.9851010292539

it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment				61194.72387933876
we engaged our word our word included everything				964.8462345286813
he placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his head whilst the musketeer got off the box				1067.4788004733819
d artagnan s friends reminded him that he had a visit to pay but at the same time bade him observe that there was yet time to retract				11940.434490299544
the count had moreover charged him to offer the two friends the key of his box at the argentina				12440.112051354221

to attain such a point the blood must be heated to thirty six degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit				34476.80009816906
but now he said that you are a widower your wife s connection can not injure you yes but understand me not being of a race of historic fame like the de courcys who were content to be plain sirs or the rohans who didn t wish to be dukes all these people who are all either vicomtes or comtes go before me at church in all the ceremonies and i can say nothing to them				126.23054661848735
the lackeys followed				7706.060254792331

there happened to be a sermon which made the church very full of people				1159.3120484732488
he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience monte cristo				378.6163553904642

as long as the procurator s wife could follow him with her eyes she waved her handkerchief to him leaning so far out of the window as to lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself				989.9982453728092
of what country are you asked the prince				827.4423550111483
you shall die and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table opened it with a feverish and trembling hand drew from it a small poniard with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade and then threw herself with a bound upon d artagnan				205.4162550914029

you are a precious creature my pretty hostess and i am much obliged to you the next moment d artagnan was on his way to notre dame				1655.2635295761393
she opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his eyes which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to contain nothing but useless documents				10107.115394967803
at the first swallow it appeared to me not to have the same taste as in the morning				687.6676435569116

d artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion				3627.8099656084814
a cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my forehead				1434.7917364495356
who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed				46608.954503153116

positively these four men must be on my side the same evening the cardinal spoke to m de tréville of the exploit of the morning which was the talk of the whole camp				1238.0266682943916
the carriage stopped at the left side of the portico two men presented themselves at the carriage window the one was ali who smiling with an expression of the most sincere joy seemed amply repaid by a mere look from monte cristo				465.1006695130344
madame de villefort in spite of all the remarks which she considered it her duty to make secretly approved of the proposition my father consented to it at her instigation and it was only on account of my poor grandfather that i finally abandoned the project				5250.532934438543
another way of getting hanged so you refuse my request to be sure i do furiously the pretty landlady was desolate				36456.87262932814

if i were to invite you and the count and countess of morcerf to this dinner i should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting or at least madame de morcerf would look upon the affair in that light especially if baron danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter				1650.734470017797
she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear				1023.9243387052779

i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villefort s face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also				1644.2580954561975
he could not distinguish her countenance but a sinister smile passed over the lips of athos				317.2919629031583
at the first we ran to the door and at the second forced it open and the monk exclaimed the executioner did you see the monk what monk the monk that was shut in with me no he was no longer here he appears to have fled by the window				641.0503883132261

the company was then heard departing then the door of the closet in which d artagnan was was opened and mme				205.7792847355031
any one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar the gorgeous robe of office and the rich lace or who gazed on that pale brow bent in anxious meditation might in the solitude of that apartment combined with the silence of the ante chambers and the measured paces of the guards upon the landing place have fancied that the shade of cardinal richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt				53605.86880084845
observing his indifference he shrugged his shoulders saying send on your business those who do theirs at the same time				349.9013416239508

noirtier made a sign that she was to do so				436.7533377848455
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body dantès did not intend to give them time to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would use his knife to better purpose				1524.9162170986056
hermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain				3964.1304717849916
my dear d artagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as i am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your turn my faith said d artagnan with great pleasure				1171.6449923776836

he grants a full pardon to the vizier ali and not only gives him his life but restores to him his fortune and his possessions my mother uttered a cry of joy and clasped me to her bosom				1901.9561703361937
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes				32724.451774338988
we have quitted business how long inquired the astonished merchant				102448.16435380759
certainly we are friends he replied why should we not be the answer was so little like the one mercédès desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan				1909.2026538995615
this concerns your head i warn you who are you then demanded d artagnan lowering the point of his sword but without yet surrendering it				96.4794676706784

what do you say to it why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence and shall we go and find him inquired franz				568.09138520602

besides said the abbé god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a father then a judge do you then believe in god said caderousse				566.2636767530981
he entered the hotel and ascended the front steps and addressing a footman who waited there in a grand livery asked if the duchess de chevreuse was visible and if she could receive the comte de la fere				1877.687972893468
so young cried felton covering that hand with his kisses				5226.188979396822
dantès made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist				30607.707911167032
what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure				5471.021641433564
should we not do better in the grottos what grottos why the grottos caves of the island i do not know of any grottos replied jacopo				4975.7860559393785
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke				1179.475859392237
will your eminence please read and examine i am acquainted with it sign it then reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given suppose i refuse then said d artagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal would you dare to touch a cardinal you have dared my lord to imprison her majesty s musketeers the queen will revenge me gentlemen i do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to paris and the parisians will defend us how uneasy they must be at this moment at rueil and saint germain said aramis				195.72684651811048
if it but lasts most capital responded porthos				44.475769033352066
i wish it then aramis paler than before but subdued by these words snapped the serpent blade between his hands and then folding his arms stood trembling with rage				2173.801401368676
mazarin is better lodged said aramis				22.11868907572714
but no matter since it is at the same time the opinion of d artagnan and of athos it must be the best but said aramis shall we not be suspected by colonel harrison egad cried d artagnan he s just the man i count upon				2230.932720639277
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency charles shook his head				489.0542439080243
the queen had written the keeper of the prison at saint germain will set councillor broussel at liberty and she had signed it				91.83401977757242
the four friends followed ten paces behind him				76.8272511651753
upon my word child exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds				67671.94604584549
porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him to depart yet awhile				50889.88754873638
the two friends remained alone to speak of the future and to build castles in the air				925.1991240717338
go for i see how impatient you are then i have leave go i tell you may i have the use of your skiff certainly then for the present m morrel farewell and a thousand thanks i hope soon to see you again my dear edmond				1204.5571908803747
you are right he is worth us all and we avow it to you aramis said athos are you jesting no no dear friend i state only what we all know				1039.4573198987982
he was alone in the darkness with sailors whom he did not know and who had no reason to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity				2064.2802308014107
yes i share your hopes the anger of heaven will not pursue us since you are pure and i am innocent				97152.14993280369
my vocation commands me it carries me away d artagnan smiled but made no answer				909.1295490539475
lord de winter on quitting d artagnan gave him his sister s address				7895.472712393732
as the envoy of the prefect of police arrived ten minutes before ten he was told that lord wilmore who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to return as the clock struck				1405.894871729036
peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch what are you going to do inquired the count				185.9808357487759
my political opinions replied dantès				80.48421245347197
the fourth auditor who during all this conversation had played a mute part made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the proposition				14209.398051028864
they had observed for some time before them on the horizon a rather thick wood and when they had arrived at a distance of a hundred steps from it monsieur d arminges took his usual precautions and sent on in advance the count s two grooms				72297.25295632987
andrea made no resistance although he protested against it				83.98464812794839
at four o clock as we have already stated the mysterious personage arrived				1567.9568580348314
how he stares at him the insolent dog				5461.71619655966
as he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime they came up to him with the purpose of making sure				3359.543033250031
save me porthos and aramis arose				2071.8359269906973
milady faltered d artagnan and fainted a second time				340.62329785222005
i have blessed you and you are sacred to me				93.60657689363573
throw myself in the water and strangle him oh gentlemen cried athos be men				657.2539595265353
i did not lose sight of him for an instant				1090.7224214386638
however as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt				58436.86886295494
and one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal one of your boarders said milady oh my god				391.6262053153181
it is not here and then he moved farther on and began again to dig				12523.854596775913
upon my honor and by the holy cross i only regret it because she was a woman the most satisfactory part of the matter said d artagnan is that there remains no trace of it she had a son observed athos				231.07191820239453
if paris has injuries to complain of who has not some wrongs to be redressed				46143.54884760432
my name is ah				322.49135085873115
i am quite ready said d artagnan but in the first place i should like to be certain of one thing and what is that asked milady				767.9601109785182
the murdered man lay on the floor his head leaning against the wall and about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle				47043.2392167063
dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it				99.63579544117516
ah monseigneur how dearly have i paid for that fault unhappy wretch as i am that gentleman i say what has become of him deign to listen to me monseigneur and be merciful				14743.596736466841
in that case i will forgive him and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him				84.31697316112627
come come gentlemen said mordaunt impatiently let us depart what exclaimed porthos without supper				1920.0861829204025
now i repeat beauchamp i wish to return to human and material existence and if you are still the friend you profess to be help me to discover the hand that struck the blow be it so said beauchamp if you must have me descend to earth i submit and if you will seek your enemy i will assist you and i will engage to find him my honor being almost as deeply interested as yours well then you understand beauchamp that we begin our search immediately				1310.7705845943553
m de morcerf is sometimes occupied his business makes him reflective and he might without intending it nothing could be in better taste than my father s demeanor madame said albert nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty years				1006.6439070197218
athos s horse where is that in the stable how much is it worth fifty pistoles at most it s worth eighty				30743.18474932696
the latter rose and bowed to the countess who inclined herself without speaking				2700.2591252828574
now sir i am listening go on i will come at once to the point				1219.9457393146292
an hour passed during which dantès excited by the feeling of freedom continued to cleave the waves				3276.4937531521296
the stranger had written to lord wilmore requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten o clock				1001.013888525311
bravo monsieur grimaud said athos and now take this				1247.9770216965128
then when the cardinal had ended alas sir				316.7083441444604
danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips				700.7032306386681
certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover monte cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the count s house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved				3774.506242981749
i had him put into a leaden coffin and i am preceding him by a few days oh				818.8547543605561
he is not dead then no monsieur he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in his body for you without question inflicted four upon the dear gentleman and he is still very weak having lost almost all his blood				1190.1990024648453
what are your excellency s orders inquired gaetano				129236.29288871367
i am sorry he does not speak french that i might tender him my compliments i am ready to receive and return them sir said the officer in pretty good french for i resided three years in paris then sir allow me to assure you that your blow was so well directed that you have nearly killed your man nearly				53951.6473977401
good god raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger				3053.361092833355
grimaud then took from the pocket of the officer all the keys it contained and first opened the door of the room in which they were then shut it and double locked it and both he and the duke proceeded rapidly down the gallery which led to the little inclosure				74855.24225897572
but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention and so he was murmured caderousse				828.5182169237846
and you what will you become				35741.812465156785
do you know that i die to morrow at ten o clock something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible the king looked at aramis with astonishment				622.2612992570776
all at once the horse stumbled against a ridge and then placed its foot on the sand				38192.48540999654
it was midnight				2495.88620974166
i do not know for i have never had it madame have you any friends i had three two of whom have left paris to go i know not where				10225.04563238094
it was many years since d artagnan had opened his heart to any one it happened however that these two men on meeting again assimilated perfectly				3011.36577920572
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder				718.4714909414918
let us see i have told you				67.91610291917152
a benefit reproached is an offense committed the devil said d artagnan you are insupportable				113324.10339795229
at that moment a man appeared in the doorway almost as pale as those in the chamber				870.4223866555488
speak doctor i am listening said villefort strike i am prepared for everything madame de saint méran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes				1332.0624801490526
and in three months time said albert you will be at my house shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards a calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said today is the of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o clock				919.1357956655836
oh sir exclaimed he thank heaven i have arrived in time				396.41700403665544
but a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with cardinal richelieu is no longer the same man				234.5040365587882
you understand dantès relations if he had any might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or alive so that now if there were anything to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience				4068.9414274696414
the officer conversed a few instants with the captain gave him several papers of which he was the bearer to read and upon the order of the merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel both passengers and sailors were called upon deck				2185.7398697937692
the host opened				1432.136910361254
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act				2290.144251921723
all this the young man perceived and yet to his praise we speak it he did not hesitate a second				1319.788057817817
the boy found him sitting where d artagnan had left him still overwhelmed by the coolness of his adversary				2108.5316458072757
good lord how cold i am cried planchet as soon as he had lost sight of his master and in such haste was he to warm himself that he went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban tavern and knocked at the door				345.46260247544467
i like to hear him talk said athos his dialect amuses me gentlemen cried aramis listen to this listen to aramis said his three friends				465.1669856475878
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while d artagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table				689.135601477625
such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable companions				885.6819202337837
bonacieux somebody is coming immediately the door opened and the superior entered				674.564737700039
i will not abandon buckingham thus				1512.0986155697613
athos was at home emptying sadly a bottle of the famous spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy				16713.345045528367
he never spoke of women				2351.117904977853
but all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hôtel				1659.6324867542198
the young girl smiled				583.7815549424827
athos slowly raised his pistol stretched out his arm so that the weapon almost touched milady s forehead and then in a voice the more terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution madame said he you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed or upon my soul i will blow your brains out with another man milady might have preserved some doubt but she knew athos				226.06371817127226
as to you comrades they said to the men nothing will happen to you if you are discreet but if you stir you are dead men the soldiers were complaisant they had found the grasp of porthos pretty powerful and that it was no joke to fight against it				85.32519530831134
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook complying with the trademark license is very easy				1403.5518269060144
the palikares who were prostrated at my father s feet now sprang up and fired and the room was filled with fire and smoke				6807.062932563397
days and weeks passed away then months dantès still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight				3660.11477933217
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom				13818.504593509446
but the duke will not yield himself without a furious battle very well said d artagnan his eyes aflame battle				1709.884264151743
the duke received them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay this tax even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its collectors by force of arms				555.1657934714831
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake one door for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit				1525.2020086051805
your probity replied the stranger is so well known to the prefect that he wishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which i am deputed to see you				146.7939472903721
as to the bastile they are not there though the bastile is especially for the frondeurs				41278.7950438378
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father				584.6760816000537
there only his memory returned to him				71.40461635769954
i returned last night and here i am what circumlocution				40830.53929999178
i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you				146.44396114901997
the duke tore open the note passed his hands over his eyes for he was dazzled and confused and read my dear duke you may entirely confide in the brave lad who will give you this note he has consented to enter the service of your keeper and to shut himself up at vincennes with you in order to prepare and assist your escape which we are contriving				35729.23692606701

no said caderousse we are not rich enough to lose francs as you please my dear sir said the jeweller i had however as you see brought you the money in bright coin and he drew from his pocket a handful of gold and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the innkeeper and in the other hand he held a packet of bank notes				4006.523122335856
and so i came added caderousse as fast as i could to have the pleasure of shaking hands with a friend worthy caderousse said the old man he is so much attached to us yes to be sure i am				1420.177035403

please your honors said the host a person in a great hurry wishes to speak to one of you to which of us asked all the four friends				581.4972879046757
my dear count said he i fear one thing and that is that the fare of the rue du helder is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna				60899.78599029793
d artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed good he said				506.59345424380274
the baron knows as well as myself that milady de winter is a very guilty woman and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation the duke put his pen to the paper				1009.4799252875705
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window				682.6933606595013
what the devil can you do with all that oh it is no trouble to spend that and i am like you i want capital capital yes i understand everyone would like capital well and i shall get it who will give it to you your prince yes my prince				903.7147660436506

all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber				846.252707543257
it is for me to give orders here and not you monsieur replied dantès proudly it was only to summon assistance for you i want none it was a temporary indisposition				4455.844200508399

he arrived in time				336.63725844100327
the first risk that dantès ran was that the jailer when he brought him his supper at seven o clock might perceive the change that had been made fortunately twenty times at least from misanthropy or fatigue dantès had received his jailer in bed and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table and went away without saying a word				549.3484757224855
