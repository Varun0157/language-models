then he offered us our liberty and we accepted it				65.8391007197211
besides i expect to lead your highness into places where you will have to walk come then said the prince let us lose no time the peasant started off running before the prince s horse then a hundred steps from the village he took a narrow road hidden at the bottom of the valley				262697.09164559515
do you hear anything said she				133.4036122466699

it was a terrible moment for the young man				141.39152859322814
he was thought to be dead his wife especially who cherished the pleasing idea that she was a widow stoutly maintained that death had taken him				34.17735471821341
my son said anne of austria pointing to the musketeer calm standing uncovered here is monsieur d artagnan who is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like so much to hear from my women				2618.9186355622287
then d artagnan ceased knocking and prayed with an accent so full of anxiety and promises terror and cajolery that his voice was of a nature to reassure the most fearful				1898113.9768436037
the names have been purposely concealed my father himself does not know who this president was and if he knows he can not tell you proper names are not in the dictionary oh misery cried franz the only hope which sustained me and enabled me to read to the end was that of knowing at least the name of him who killed my father				897.1203696383787
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door and there was no address given the party all separated château renaud albert and morrel went one way and debray and beauchamp the other				407.07752206984
wait how long i must calculate our chances i will give you the signal but you will not leave me you will come to me or you will let me come to you				62.04326323932373
it is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by valentine during the minute and a half madame de villefort remained in the room				188.48482253152721
d artagnan stopped before them and they stopped before him				31.252536000393114
he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet				823.3640571000166
a gallant knight can not decline a rendezvous with a lady but a prudent gentleman may excuse himself from not waiting on his eminence particularly when he has reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments i am of aramis s opinion said porthos				177.91830459094282
they would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me my mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my father s heart				349.7407058474606
franz continued it was as we said the fifth of february				178369.5527029296
during all this time the general on whom they thought to have relied as on a brother manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance				98091.70307666458
for the rest he was dumb blind and deaf and of unimpeachable fidelity				941634.9963164113
we have had a narrow escape but said valentine timidly does all the father s shame revert upon the son				887.8028431168317
but the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach				1013593.8807120529
as you are my commander it is my duty to obey and springing backward he broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it threw the pieces over the convent wall and crossed his arms whistling a cardinalist air				1552.5653081972625
the two witnesses followed				7961.694073253118
one arm was hanging out of the bed from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of germain pillon s graces but the fore arm seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the hand so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed				791.9117197616196
when sir i tell you all this with tears of heartfelt anguish can you reply that i am wrong can you prevent my putting an end to my miserable existence				2300.363229265905
spada knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message cæsar wills that you die but it was a legate à latere who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope his holiness requests you to dine with him spada set out about two o clock to san pierdarena				1723747.2293833327
and will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort i promise on my honor then said the abbé we may hope to put our design into execution and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work at least a year and shall we begin at once at once we have lost a year to no purpose cried dantès				584.2566452219645
come this way gentlemen come m villefort for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities he then took villefort s arm and at the same time holding that of madame danglars under his own he dragged the procureur to the plantain tree where the shade was thickest				2162449.0090199444
one day as i was setting off on an expedition go said she at your return i will give you a surprise i questioned her but in vain she would tell me nothing and i departed				11419.270847557125
he seemed scarcely five and thirty				17381.63188160717
m de tréville requested athos whatever might happen to be observant of his duty to the king but particularly to the queen begging him to convey his desires to his comrades				4864.190045270326
on his side d artagnan became more cautious also				1524.7795215232545
this boat contained an officer a mate and eight rowers				1075354.2558321618
when everything was ready the gallows hung in the middle of the room the loop made and when the duke had cast a glance upon the plate of crawfish in order to select the finest specimen among them he looked around for his piece of glass it had disappeared				598.6465996547043
ali returned a sign in the negative				98746.93716174162
grimaud drew near and kissed it respectfully				10394.588400926352
the body forgets sometimes but the mind always remembers and how far back into the past do your recollections extend i could scarcely walk when my mother who was called vasiliki which means royal said the young girl tossing her head proudly took me by the hand and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the prisoners saying he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a word to my father we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the prisoners and how old were you at that time i was three years old said haydée				4773.234369310779
are our lackeys sufficiently devoted to us to risk their lives for us				356.820562157974
they passed through a courtyard as they went full of soldiers and courtiers				16636.806008202006
you then served louis xviii and you did not show any favor it was your duty today you serve napoleon and you ought to protect him it is equally your duty i come therefore to ask what has become of him villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself				167.96064664633013
with your permission said danglars bowing i will precede you to show you the way by all means replied monte cristo i follow you chapter				233.10110404998525
a high wall at the angle of which was the pavilion ran along one side of this lane and on the other was a little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a hedge from passers by				7117.119310384904
i know you are not quite my friends and i am sorry you are not so but i know you are brave and loyal gentlemen and that confidence may be placed in you				54.973156222480256
a tailor said the host and for what to make us between now and tomorrow two roman peasant costumes returned albert				334.9738877550229
morrel passed his hand over his brow it seemed to him a dream				1429.011296226593
he approached the dying man and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy look he whispered i am i am and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to hear it				82.22050755951683
these rascals will adjourn when they find that they are not in sufficient force said the comte de la fere				5062.257041728699
the abbé told me it was worth francs muttered caderousse				362.81541109742983
devil take him then he said aloud the queen my lord				274.2222224284656
as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event				11065.351095293854
i love your devotedness said milady				260.02769760769405
the guards were under arms and d artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades				4886.4283603618715
one of them went away and dantès heard his shoes striking on the pavement				32219.226243788133
ennui is the mortal enemy of prisoners i had ennui and i amused myself with twisting that rope felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated and over her head he perceived a gilt headed screw fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons				37393.85215657206
grimaud made a sign that he was not				689.576402319456
at this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near and a bright light flashed over the room				185.9061800101688
what are you going to tell me are we quite alone my friend yes quite but why all these precautions because i have a terrible secret to communicate to you said the doctor				1817.9912141347743
and me too said aramis				29.36609014996291
a signed statement noirtier was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair				24820.72718529628
i speak as one who admires you mademoiselle mademoiselle cried valentine mademoiselle				204314.75331797134

but such is man we always want something more than we already have what does porthos wish for to be a baron ah true				1063.3221653349613
the assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without having killed their man they should be accused by him therefore their first idea was to join the enemy				1145.5275891289466
try therefore either to carry me to some place where i may see a priest or take the trouble to send one to me here				1192.1989579397246

m morrel paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old man had contracted				51157.809630521166
the tutor followed them				102.59804149805393
there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen				737807.6035154811
his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence				746276.1539883733
lay him down here we ll gag him and tie him no matter where somewhere				65406.816985989375
joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the dew on the ground after a long drought both the heart and the ground absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and nothing is outwardly apparent				882882.615661906
higher monsieur higher of madame d aiguillon still higher of madame de chevreuse higher much higher of the d artagnan checked himself				196.60255360662347
this side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch day and night are you quite sure of that certain				1481925.432239364
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of he who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences them himself well on my word of honor i answered no i wished no ill to morcerf he was a little proud perhaps for a man who like myself has risen from nothing but we all have our faults				838720.0217391552
father said mercédès stopping when she had reached the centre of the table sit i pray you on my right hand on my left i will place him who has ever been as a brother to me pointing with a soft and gentle smile to fernand but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his lips became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart				379.4589613797689
involuntarily his languid eyes closed and still through his eyelashes a well known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped				573771.7094379484
i do not understand italian yes but you understand french and mazarin laid his hand upon guitant s shoulder				794.0568179777107

at the first sound of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria				1134611.7400986827
see and she exposed her face completely to view see misfortune has silvered my hair my eyes have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim of purple and my brow is wrinkled				1380220.0302490706
the count cried a young voice that made athos start				15536.76977205447
your blessing your holiness before you go i beseech you he cried				1374.795663195749
you are all mistaken gentlemen answered athos gravely you are eating horse eating what said d artagnan				30.015834341055072
when that is over you sir can return to paris while your wife passes the time of her mourning with her mother in law as you please sir said franz				827.7071439497489

mine also are from him indeed sir i recognize you you are captain mordaunt mordaunt was startled				907072.3766863385
the doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it he only satisfied himself by milady s pulse that the case was not serious				46236.97986003547
what would you do i should give up broussel said porthos				69.51216742886233
and the crew asked morrel				212.76017576838157
you are very lucky if you see anything such a night as this said porthos				73.57245495546275
it was there that my father ruined by the revolution and m danglars who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different fortunes yes said monte cristo i think m danglars mentioned that in a visit which i paid him and continued he casting a side glance at lucien who was turning over the leaves of an album mademoiselle eugénie is pretty i think i remember that to be her name very pretty or rather very beautiful replied albert but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful fellow you speak as if you were already her husband ah returned albert in his turn looking around to see what lucien was doing				2611.269702058409
de villefort what do you mean i mean that m de nargonne your first husband being neither a philosopher nor a banker or perhaps being both and seeing there was nothing to be got out of a king s attorney died of grief or anger at finding after an absence of nine months that you had been enceinte six				1905.0304016548046
it is an excellent spot for bringing down a man in proper style i think decidedly observed aramis gentlemen that the son hasn t his mother s energy what my good fellow replied athos wait awhile we have scarcely left him two hours ago he does not know yet in what direction we came nor where we are				869.9223953805587
it was three o clock when he threw himself on the bed				735.5298932892283
the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent and himself the bird which flies from branch to branch without power to escape				4302.58384726788
when the name of colonel fairfax was called one of those brief but solemn silences ensued which announced the absence of the members who had no wish to take a personal part in the trial				19381.164300387758
parry was not wrong				4591.58304263402
steps approach i go adieu and dantès happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend s mental instability glided like a snake along the narrow passage while faria restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the stone into place with his foot and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery				3161.879201877427
his breast was covered with a coat of mail the knife was bent against it				96.52396475907562
hush murmured the dying man that they may not separate us if you save me you are right				884.7153214177372
franz lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless one of the halting places of the wandering visitors of monte cristo				365.8898405188504
do you find yourself badly lodged sister				2970.644903747023
at present i no longer think of it and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our popular government well then your government would do well to choose from the past something better than the things that i have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever				25842.62404111121
i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively that it seems as if i had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young people of the present day will not fight it remains for us to do so				427.76631808709135
he believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold so that when he saw merely and simply instead of the executioner he expected only his commissary of the preceding evening attended by his clerk he was ready to embrace them both				10319.934923510611
and he is very rich i am not so sure of that and yet you said he had money fifty thousand livres a mere trifle he is well educated hem said monte cristo in his turn				1035.248856245116
some workmen must have fallen underneath them and been hurt aramis shuddered in spite of himself				193.67610288379214
i am not willing it should be known i have left the camp and if they follow us we shall be certain they will tell nobody we are gentlemen monseigneur said athos require our parole and give yourself no uneasiness				1669.0702449171695
then i must make a journey to see my family in the lower part of brittany to obtain the sum necessary for my departure porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice				57620.334922380825
oh if she betrayed your majesty on the side of your honor it would be quite another thing and i should be the first to say no grace sire no grace for the guilty happily there is nothing of the kind and your majesty has just acquired a new proof of it that is true monsieur cardinal said the king and you were right as you always are but the queen not the less deserves all my anger it is you sire who have now incurred hers				86747.10578943297
is this all no i have for the end of the month these bills which have been assigned to us by the house of pascal and the house of wild turner of marseilles amounting to nearly francs in all francs it is impossible to describe what morrel suffered during this enumeration				1062531.0855493254
do you think so sir				386.87042911913045
it is not here and then he moved farther on and began again to dig				120290.76371149575

so said the cardinal in a tone that contrasted strongly with the severity of his words you have constituted yourselves judges without remembering that they who punish without license to punish are assassins monseigneur i swear to you that i never for an instant had the intention of defending my head against you				63.93829343763031

monseigneur said marshal de grammont with a radiant face will your highness permit my son count de guiche and his traveling companion viscount de bragelonne to come in and give news of the enemy whom they have found while we were looking for him what eagerly replied the prince will i permit				11444.204064794812
you are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first time and even the second while the other as you must know is very simple				28987.17042839836
he had tried his strength to the utmost				15411.789834258328

franz however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent				20332.48801848396
in truth that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no longer was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which seemed as we have observed more appropriate to a phantom than a living creature from the corridors deserted by courtiers and courts crowded with guards from that spirit of bitter ridicule which arising from the streets below penetrated through the very casements of the room which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against the minister as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns firing let off happily without other end or aim except to show to the guards the swiss troops and the military who surrounded the palais royal that the people were possessed of arms				592.1666560270374
we render service to god madame in serving a prince so unfortunate a queen so virtuous				1820655.5451404825

thus armed the count held the lives of five men in his hands				540.3531874991425
d artagnan placed the ring on his finger and again waited it was evident that all was not yet over				1422.140219706913

the gratings are every day carefully examined by jailers whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and intelligence				6578.650871476768
this is what i shall do i will wait until the very moment you are married for i will not lose the shadow of one of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us since m franz may after all die before that time a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it nothing appears impossible to one condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from death is concerned				160535.89026136755

at the precise time when madame danglars dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to debray s apartments notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought as a friend of the family to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions				4177.726619832222
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after you how so i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majesty s ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor d artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues				5748.320136762678
you never knew her eh madame who knows said athos				16.363090344291685

madame de villefort received them with equal solemnity				10614.959207829092
it is indeed the same said he and now am i to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical terror				1197.1750282473304
it was given to you by that veiled lady i met you with the other sunday near the gate st honoré no upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman i bought it with the contents of my own purse answered he whom they designated by the name porthos				202.8244317070576
i come from a land where there is not a cloud in the sky it is not like this then said porthos stretching out his hand to assure himself whether a chill sensation he felt on his cheek was not really caused by a drop of rain				35157.22991814333
horses nowadays are not what they were formerly observed porthos everything degenerates i have sent grimaud to dammartin said aramis				171.6757411155917
dantès redoubled his efforts he seemed like one of the ancient titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father of the gods				974615.912600236
alas alas said he to himself misfortune is over my head my wife must have committed some frightful crime				10306.78474628826
i hoped to be able to rely upon that and i madame said d artagnan embarrassed you promised me take my arm madame said the stranger and let us continue our way d artagnan however stupefied cast down annihilated by all that happened stood with crossed arms before the musketeer and mme				159.89506029492114
i have never seen her from that day				381.1748849859844
monte cristo seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this scene could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said come gentlemen some coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn				633291.7194280354
that happened as i told you in				1151.5250003197764
this time you shall not escape me neither is it my intention monsieur for this time i was seeking you in the name of the king i arrest you how				1263.1370237691738
he was of pale complexion with clear blue eyes rather deeply set his mouth fine and well cut remained motionless in its correct lines his chin strongly marked denoted that strength of will which in the ordinary britannic type denotes mostly nothing but obstinacy a brow a little receding as is proper for poets enthusiasts and soldiers was scarcely shaded by short thin hair which like the beard which covered the lower part of his face was of a beautiful deep chestnut color				8189.418578395786

then the iron hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his eyes he bent his head and wept				17859.192959685464
an officer was placing two soldiers at the door of each drawing room and was advancing towards danglars preceded by a commissary of police girded with his scarf				1023034.2648177693
directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly thing i was so persuaded that everyone must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name that i was not surprised to see my father start and almost tremble but i even thought though that surely must have been a mistake that m danglars trembled too morrel morrel cried my father stop a bit then knitting his brows into a deep frown he added surely this can not be one of the morrel family who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartism i mean about the year yes replied m danglars i believe he is the son of the old shipowner indeed answered maximilian and what did your father say then valentine oh such a dreadful thing that i don t dare to tell you always tell me everything said maximilian with a smile				558.2224707299463
one terrible idea pressed upon her mind that someone existed in the world who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again				280.178393882084
ah i have been running very fast mademoiselle but i must do m morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster noirtier directed their attention to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a glass				1004.2256699875738
then a strange reaction took place he who had just abandoned endeavored to save the francs he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of privation he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness				22675.046131538642
soon as the road turned the chateau de la valliere appeared in view then a quarter of a mile beyond a white house encircled in sycamores was visible at the farther end of a group of trees which spring had powdered with a snow of flowers				1742.3628599981107
an attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first desk				2556.858739145529
if when you arrive at cours la reine you find no one you must go on to saint germain				3204.384033803394
her opera glass was so fixedly directed towards them that franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who use their boxes to hold receptions the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess				4312.05638543883
la ramee was in ecstasies at having beaten a prince of the blood				2120.8204472166017
two of the men appeared bearing the woman in their arms and carried her to the carriage into which the little old man got after her				221.20350999937085
monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it and i made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness thanks my captain replied d artagnan who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general				1365.7181573058513
who ever heard of such an occurrence as this a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams				826534.6663965111
two large slabs of marble on which were inscribed their names were placed on either side of a little enclosure railed in and shaded by four cypress trees				3025.9873500752833
danglars bent his head which he meant to imply very well the carriage again moved on				1243.410408234376
we are about to leave this evening continued mazarin				378.7647869993972
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed renée you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint méran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past				1161.6704908221673
why just remember what they said				303.75061745771796
i have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans				7118.633064641947
yes and who is the man i do not know why did he not bring it to me here the messenger did not say and where is the messenger he went away directly he saw me enter the ball room to find you oh said the countess to franz go with all speed poor young man				114.57886802473831
in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on d artagnan s finger the place of the queen s ring carefully kept in a casket				7908.8115531204585
ah yes said faria the penknife				127720.16894503358
the palace of the louvre contains two things the king who must die and royalty which never dies				701578.5738152944
listen said he				8.15562727979618
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerf s adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known				6144.047125765522
do you fear he will not understand yes oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how i talk to you then turning to maximilian with an adorable smile although shaded by sorrow he knows everything i know said she				1362.0618724626029
here i have brought mine with me replied albert				464.55896154881316
the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no one had been there to mow it				90.20490262164257
grandpapa says it is a panacea valentine smiled but it was evident that she suffered				159226.14232758112
meanwhile do not be surprised at anything that happens prepare yourself for every emergency charles shook his head				332.94083508863486
the pharaon				4123.757787879099
except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to decipher them i am very ignorant of heraldry i a count of a fresh creation fabricated in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary				3405.776712613716
and have you placed the letter before him as i ordered you to do the slave respectfully signalized that he had				1456868.9229798778
it was a night of joy and terror such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime				781367.5449166729
he guessed likewise by induction that porthos was taking his revenge for the defeat of chantilly when the procurator s wife had proved so refractory with respect to her purse				2224.8062618706463
ah you have a noble heart said the count so much the better this exclamation which corresponded to the count s own thought rather than to what albert was saying surprised everybody and especially morrel who looked at monte cristo with wonder				7827.241357455126
the next day mercédès came to implore the protection of m de villefort she did not obtain it however and went to visit the old man when she saw him so miserable and heart broken having passed a sleepless night and not touched food since the previous day she wished him to go with her that she might take care of him but the old man would not consent				51620.15129339327
i wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit				15066.453161758622
then here s to our next merry meeting adieu dear captain said porthos i shall always be happy to welcome you to my barony yes yes when the campaign is over replied the gascon				1143.6277392686136
and he is in paris continued he addressing raoul then turning to the queen we may still hope				1313.124035587435
at five o clock in the morning the straw was worth eighty francs a truss and there was no more to be had				1222807.1749644973
having gained his room he raised his hand to his face and observing that his fingers were covered with the monarch s blood fell down insensible				9028.236512030331
good lord try one throw				2440338.515747176
constance replied the young man where are you				77.87804082795486
morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him				37.11277388004219
the very same				1228.2294425428588
he denies himself nothing it may easily be seen he has been accustomed to live well never mind if his mistress abandons him he will find friends i will answer for it				87.05016369308083
at this moment athos perceived a man walking on the seashore parallel to the jetty and hastening his steps as if to reach the other side of the port scarcely twenty steps from the place of embarking				457073.0461395912
oh it would be a sacrilege				43369.64406724538
it would not be long before i should be training dogs to say that there were greater traitors in france than the cardinal mazarin at this athos and aramis could not help exchanging not only a look but a smile and had they not known it for a fact this would have told them that de chatillon and de flamarens had been there				767.0901659012158
mercédès remained therefore by his bedside and m morrel went away making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney piece but availing himself of the doctor s order the old man would not take any sustenance at length after nine days of despair and fasting the old man died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to mercédès if you ever see my edmond again tell him i die blessing him the abbé rose from his chair made two turns round the chamber and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat				2408.056615043009
we should presume too much on our own strength and like others perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each other s prudence how can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought dear valentine				729.1168945261448
do you intend opening the door said the baroness				2181.121370695931
that count of monte cristo is an original who loves to look at the sky even at night and where do the servants sleep oh they have a house to themselves				4803.629587427156
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by way of getting out of the scrape i said ask morcerf he has got the whole history of his beloved monte cristo at his fingers ends whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you is it not almost incredible said madame danglars that a person having at least half a million of secret service money at his command should possess so little information let me assure you madame said lucien that had i really the sum you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte cristo whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob				1218021.3159078914
oh what larks meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which one of the keepers was leaning				798510.7366949972
well how is he now asked he				11.870623496343294
cromwell is stout and short and this man thin and lanky rather tall than otherwise some condemned soldier perhaps suggested athos whom they have pardoned at the price of regicide no no continued d artagnan it was not the measured step of a foot soldier nor was it the gait of a horseman				17572.5724437285
i am a physiognomist i assure you d artagnan went out first as had been agreed upon				4338.807270444916
two or three hammocks hung upon the ceiling a table and two benches composed the entire furniture				5672.465935445231
you would no sooner have left prison than your goods would be confiscated i shall no sooner be out of prison than i shall be master of paris pshaw				102177.4966803841
i shall pass all my life thought d artagnan in seeking for a man who is really contented with his lot whilst making this reflection chance seemed as it were to give him the lie direct				1571988.3319637238
swords then cried aramis swords				6611.797499184974
will this promise be fulfilled m noirtier asked morrel while d avrigny looked inquiringly				3183393.3916574917
no but just think there are paltry country squires who have all some title or another and pretend to go back as far as charlemagne or at least to hugh capet				1233419.5348360667
at length they heard the cannon so near that it was evident they were within a league of the field of battle and at a turn of the road they perceived the little village of aunay				41841.242808095274
i of course give him the same title and everyone else does likewise what a strange man you are				869.9738335052914
if they catch thee thou wilt be hung true replied grimaud				530.1009575583832
a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict				2026761.5225451996
thomson french said he do you know this house monsieur they are my bankers in the capital of the christian world returned the count quietly				5259.1876639815655
you have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you i shall very soon learn that language by signs valentine and i promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us oh see maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse me he is inflexible he will never pardon me				72.82502975708763
we are observed they are coming to meet us				336.84889181732115
well let us pledge the ring but upon one condition what that there shall be five hundred crowns for you and five hundred crowns for me don t dream it athos				186.2716757145608
franz anticipated his wishes by saying that the noise fatigued him and that he should pass the next day in writing and looking over his journal				63011.05366267159
we are about to have the honor of charging you replied aramis lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other				406.47235011924784
i was pretty drunk yesterday d artagnan said he i can tell that by my tongue which was swollen and hot this morning and by my pulse which was very tremulous				866521.4690807001
up to that time whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it this maxim without being generally adopted nevertheless passed from theory into practice but the notes did it injury				216917.72365941296
then he is here he is said monte cristo when the valet de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation				35744.67580792437
so i shall never be a great man as he was but to compensate for that i shall be a good man monsieur de rochefort and i hope to prove it to you rochefort knew well the tones of that soft voice in which sounded sometimes a sort of gentle lisp like the hissing of young vipers				1399605.5060863176
a certain emotion for which he could not account made the lieutenant s heart beat he had no longer the assurance of youth experience had taught him the importance of past events				18134.535962532478
there was something so strange in these three words that everybody except the king shuddered				4149.205977098882
take it from me when i am dead yes sire said a voice which athos recognized as that of aramis				174.6391131226037
come come tréville hold your tongue said the king				379.08026183833096
oh beautiful life				631.5320719374907
and here are the other five hundred replied milady placing her hand upon the bag of gold				2021.762335825509
d artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner to whom this man had confided some important missive				1205823.3253069501
these important advantages d artagnan found to his own taste in the rue tiquetonne at the sign of the roe				873023.7308688585
but vampa raised his head proudly as to teresa her eyes sparkled when she thought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of gold				1957.6652197643411
d artagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding they unfastened the two horses that were waiting at the door leaped upon them buried their spurs in their sides and set off at full gallop				1673.97205828848
thanks monsieur bonacieux said d artagnan emptying his glass that is all i wanted of you				70.94924753437007
when he saw the formidable and chosen body with which louis xiii				756.6497978390869
if the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup will retain its color if on the contrary the lemonade be drugged with poison the syrup will become green				573692.9192948029
franz waited until all was in order and when the sail was filled and the four sailors had taken their places three forward and one at the helm he resumed the conversation				573.9558138151762
a recollection of athos came into her mind				681.8842385521116
on the next day mathieu molé the chief president whose courage at this crisis says the cardinal de retz was equal to that of the duc de beaufort and the prince de condé in other words of the two men who were considered the bravest in france had been attacked in his turn				1164.0187446838934
oh woe to me yes you are now on the right path said the count crossing his arms over his broad chest search search but what have i done to you exclaimed villefort whose mind was balancing between reason and insanity in that cloud which is neither a dream nor reality what have i done to you				53.72485542443517
grimaud speaks				219724.73648031038
in a quarter of an hour he returned accompanied by a tall man masked and wrapped in a large red cloak				880.6108431216958
i had designedly taken this direction				3602.524693858371
morrel had long thought of danglars but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource				129853.51578693165
he came to renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the medium of a letter signed baronne danglars née hermine de servieux albert was accompanied by lucien debray who joining in his friend s conversation added some passing compliments the source of which the count s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess				690847.1952107232
just as you were complaining of being tired and obliged to walk but as he spoke the barrel of a pistol was presented at his breast and these words were pronounced touch it not grimaud he cried grimaud				858.2162519402465
come come gentlemen said mordaunt impatiently let us depart what exclaimed porthos without supper				4647.244805572584
he had even given orders to arrest her and would have cut off her head had she not escaped with her waiting maid poor kitty				2159.589291649124
come answer freely m bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible				931.6262411796563
mademoiselle s lady s maid says sir that mademoiselle is finishing her toilette and will be here shortly danglars nodded to signify that he was satisfied				1506.6596365576956
i wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom but your brother maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure then turning around and seeing that morrel still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low voice pressing emmanuel s hand significantly watch over him why so asked the young man surprised				20860.086604522043
d avrigny continued to look at noirtier he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round his cheeks turn pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead				3599.9626214332075
meanwhile lord de winter the deputies the leaders of the expedition the officers of buckingham s household had all made their way into the chamber				557.5507676091278
now an enemy is never so near and consequently so threatening as when he has completely disappeared				604.32483652434
is supper ready signor pastrini yes your excellency well then let us sup but the carriage and horses said franz				785.8891545600042
oh i am a christian cried dantès guessing instinctively that this man meant to abandon him				32.94577516968185
how much asked danglars				226.76471950477736
her first trial was lost she acted like a woman who reckons up her resources				170684.83133167663
oh yes yes this instant i entreat you in a moment that part of the floor on which dantès was resting his two hands as he knelt with his head in the opening suddenly gave way he drew back smartly while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed				15654.833586694096
i will answer for that you know sir said the governor persisting that we are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination				11213.513336933787
and the troop continued their route				1484.319187945738
you do not understand me gentlemen said d artagnan throwing up his head the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a bright ray of the sun				2821.0495430325127
and madame de villefort cried baptistin				353412.9677140638
this reassured her				139.42179220529025
i enclose a draft for livres payable on m ferrea banker at nice and also a letter of introduction to the count of monte cristo whom i have directed to supply all your wants				6449.150657380125
are you come to fetch me asked he				19.904162651458293
i am as i trust you do not doubt your devoted du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds well said aramis what do you say to that i say my dear d herblay that it is almost sacrilege to distrust providence when one has such friends and therefore we will divide the pistoles from porthos as we divided the louis sent by d artagnan the division being made by the light of bazin s taper the two friends continued their road and a quarter of an hour later they had joined de winter at the porte saint denis				5564.968466464233
d artagnan swore loud enough to be heard in the skies				769633.6716375989
come my lord you shall be treated like a prince as you are a fallen prince exclaimed mazarin piteously				192885.54420694135
afterward mme				106.19302276016917
it is my soul that must be saved as for my body it is lost to die whilst doing a good deed				64073.32154407976
like other dwellers in the south he was a man of sober habits and moderate desires but fond of external show vain and addicted to display				1323490.6468496623
one now and then i don t say much about but seven in two days i repeat it is too many it is far too many therefore sire your majesty sees that they are come quite contrite and repentant to offer you their excuses quite contrite and repentant				1392923.6420523734
well you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain what have i then done to you said felton much agitated that you should load me with such a responsibility before god and before men				1208.9661214321047
it was already too late				1799.4252161206657
toxicology it was really the count of monte cristo who had just arrived at madame de villefort s for the purpose of returning the procureur s visit and at his name as may be easily imagined the whole house was in confusion				3998.785602245932
do you know about that institution i have heard of it it is a magnificent charity having said this the abbé bowed to imply he wished to pursue his studies				2125198.976211422
have you not read in my eyes that there is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart yes replied mme				182.691852088612

now the sight of this chateau had taken raoul back fifty leagues westward and had caused him to review his life from the moment when he had taken leave of little louise to that in which he had seen her for the first time and every branch of oak every gilded weathercock on roof of slates reminded him that instead of returning to the friends of his childhood every instant estranged him further and that perhaps he had even left them forever				4616.751481572095
nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder dantès the very paper was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in edmond s time had all disappeared the four walls alone remained as he had left them				118.37229561747677

sir said d artagnan how can you talk like that when you are in the company of gentlemen and have such an excellent sword at your side no sword is excellent enough to be of use against four swords and daggers well that is scarcely the question				601.5403974292559
her lips were cold it appeared to d artagnan that he had embraced a statue				3084.6221708953244
is that the look of a man whose victim is likely to escape him				33.63301503586048

the light was so faint in the room that albert did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the count s visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and shoulders				900.8837246295487
the two nobles saluted each other politely for if no friendship existed between them there was at least esteem				1113816.1505667767
if you can be satisfied with my dinner it consists of cooked tetragones and fruits what do you mean by tetragones asked d artagnan uneasily				1305.242685066955
certainly a call to the visitors room had scarcely astonished andrea less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making use of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid silence				533.6126698919654

credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the of the present month and the one hundred thousand francs due on the of the next month to m de boville m morrel had in reality no hope but the return of the pharaon of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel which had weighed anchor at the same time and which had already arrived in harbor				100658.44525040295
no and yet your father a man accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over you he should have occupied my place he should have emptied that glass he should have risen against the assassin				8872.412804729065
d artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind them but although the king knew athos porthos and aramis personally he passed before them without speaking or looking indeed as if he had never seen them before				859.8514515350585

the earl of essex tis true wore a splendid ring set with diamonds given him by his royal mistress whilst i i have nothing but a simple circlet of gold with a cipher on it and a date but that ring has been blessed in the chapel of the palais royal so they will never ruin me as they long to do and whilst they shout down with mazarin i unknown and unperceived by them incite them to cry out long live the duke de beaufort one day another long live the prince de conde and again long live the parliament and at this word the smile on the cardinal s lips assumed an expression of hatred of which his mild countenance seemed incapable				1028500.7022839921
oh no he exclaimed not die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much				1495.5407554131857
he leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier				1711984.3926118803
she learned drawing music everything				808.8996733794532
oh my lord continued the queen without restraining her tears it is better to fight as the king has done and to die as perhaps he will than live in beggary like me courage madame				669.5182462276691
mistrust everybody your friend your brother your mistress your mistress above all d artagnan blushed				5193.649943939379
i am going away the day after tomorrow do what you please monsieur chevalier				23929.211368902706
they halted for a minute during which he strove to collect his thoughts				1094.1875992779799
it appears to me that we have an account to settle with him and that it is not our custom to leave a place without paying our debts of this kind at least ah				570.9199636354383
from whom asked the gascon				1156.4923179399761
ah exclaimed the baroness without expressing the ideas which the exclamation betrayed				1214359.673364804
well have you sent asked monte cristo seeing morrel return				1617.3219070884895
but for the moment let us do as did the amorous gascon we will see after the worthy mercer later				6591.4306353920465
the count is an affable man besides he is unarmed at the first word from his eminence the two soldiers about him would run to his assistance two soldiers said d artagnan seeming to remember something two soldiers yes that then is why i hear two men called every evening and see them walking sometimes for half an hour under my window that is it they are waiting for the cardinal or rather for bernouin who comes to call them when the cardinal goes out fine looking men upon my word said d artagnan				94.69936930468803
do you believe it was because i committed the sacrilege of mounting en croupe behind henry iv				2047.6914723999566
he sends me for that purpose and here i am the poor woman s head and arms fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees				1562.6008180424528
what do you say athos to that proposition				37105.46940145887
i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at villefort to be examined by such a man as you for this envious person is a real enemy and by the rapid glance that the young man s eyes shot forth villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness				883841.3118518679
he hastened to open the secrétaire and found the pocket book in the drawer and in it the letter of credit				8771.00318144772
they came to an opening behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks by which a man could scarcely pass				2994.5807483867447
milady made one step forward and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent				45009.299587747075
if you loved me oh if you loved me that would be too great happiness and i should run mad				3796.752585947178
d artagnan then remembered the injunction if you value your own life or that of those who love you remain motionless and as if you had seen nothing he stopped therefore trembling not for himself but for the poor woman who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this rendezvous				5991.820899211582
the latter made a sign and when the carriages had drawn close together said you are going to madame de morcerf s are you not no replied madame danglars i am too ill you are wrong replied villefort significantly it is important that you should be seen there do you think so asked the baroness				2040.6694436968519
lord winter s tent was pitched by the side of the royal marquee a kind of corridor communicating between the two				1376.1303623550677
so i went to danglars who would not even receive me				66.65014142840974
the blow was parried				390411.3207726648
debray was not yet come but albert knew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera				7575.91009257399
occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then care was taken to select partners worthy of him sometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a president or some dowager duchess				8894.524546054428
it was ten o clock at night the branches of the great trees in the garden of the count s house stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered				511361.296447372
have you admired the rapidity of my fall				4969.312963743462
he whispered a hope to himself that this beloved relative might be killed in the field				39355.42158288033
i can well believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself				749.4477523244406
morrel examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the money				1051.03932827519
d artagnan in order that there might be no time lost had saddled his horse himself				184.30954069833228

perhaps you liked what m danglars said another sign in the negative				149623.0606243256
i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the pharaon and look carefully to the unloading of her freight				1204495.8495848635
if you know why don t you tell she is under the big chestnut tree replied the spoiled brat as he gave in spite of his mother s commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare				33266.48896584723
as to the goldsmith he wrote to his wife sending her the order for the thousand pistoles and charging her to send him in exchange his most skillful apprentice an assortment of diamonds of which he gave the names and the weight and the necessary tools				1464826.70771564

here said he leaning heavily on the arm of monte cristo here is the spot where my father stopped when the pharaon entered the port it was here that the good old man whom you saved from death and dishonor threw himself into my arms				585.7169133376369
a peer of france ah said andrea who knows major cavalcanti is already one perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished no politics caderousse				612.8290679470999
raoul sprang from his horse to which he left the charge of its own preservation and in three or four strokes was at the gentleman s side he seized the horse at once by the curb and raised its head above water the animal began to breathe again and as if he comprehended that they had come to his aid redoubled his efforts				5875.060079433249
and i too edmond oh				566.7639664456987
your fellow countryman bonaparte became emperor we had forgotten to say that jacopo was a corsican				23414.73928293884
you have sent for me sir said athos to m de tréville in a feeble yet perfectly calm voice you have sent for me as my comrades inform me and i have hastened to receive your orders				6719.557070561517
the prince read as he hastened on				1061.0009771027362
i dare say you know how to navigate should he fail us my dear friend you guess well				479.95379661849177
and yet if she were a man she would attempt all this and perhaps might succeed why then did heaven make the mistake of placing that manlike soul in that frail and delicate body				335.99386319903124
now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property all my fortune is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand francs then sell out sell out marquis or you will lose it all but how can i sell out here you have a broker have you not yes then give me a letter to him and tell him to sell out without an instant s delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no time then and sitting down he wrote a letter to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price				104371.2818857531
you will be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past madame make use of mine and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan thank you sir thank you replied the baroness you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires who intends for some time at least to retire from the world debray was for a moment surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an air which seemed to say as you please madame madame danglars had until then perhaps hoped for something but when she saw the careless bow of debray and the glance by which it was accompanied together with his significant silence she raised her head and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her				186.42966687290973
did you ever see that man before he came twice to milady s that s it				83.87447106668141
because she had been branded continued d artagnan				32.56219369172193
what you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you will be allowed to walk about and some day you will meet the governor and if he chooses to reply that is his affair but asked dantès how long shall i have to wait ah a month six months a year it is too long a time				682.8594029649746

de chatillon saw him fall and announced it in a loud voice to his men which raised their spirits and completely disheartened their enemies so that every man thought only of his own safety and tried to gain the trenches where the coadjutor was trying to reform his disorganized regiment				86060.62544092638
château renaud was at his post apprised by beauchamp of the circumstances he required no explanation from albert				329.9471705286179
that will be sufficient you think so certainly very well then if they should hear of the separation ah yes what could i say that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the enemies of your family by the corsinari precisely				91076.10547605464
grimaud my good grimaud exclaimed raoul here you are at last				3404.692052775799

i heard the name of rochefort				720.923499011245
ah i can understand that				628.9793791358331
then m de tréville made a sign with his hand and all retired except d artagnan who did not forget that he had an audience and with the tenacity of a gascon remained in his place				571.9540340408299
the title attracted me i took them home with me with the permission of the guardian and devoured them				109.73178333195561
what battle does it represent that of marignan just at the point where one of my forefathers is offering his sword to francis i who has broken his				1398.0292319315931
now not a second to lose for a second lost will perhaps save them				108.2199742842531
but as regards your wish to visit our fine city my dear count i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize plans that i have long meditated franz did not doubt that these plans were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the grotto of monte cristo and while the count was speaking the young man watched him closely hoping to read something of his purpose in his face but his countenance was inscrutable especially when as in the present case it was veiled in a sphinx like smile				497.8289661344794
but i do not mean my friend that we were right in what we did				2937.511824772927
come now you don t really wish it but he is dead i am sure of it he was a very contrary fellow and might come back on purpose to have us hanged all right if he comes back you will kill him you are so skillful and so brave peste				23240.76792778522

she cried out but d avrigny paid no attention to her possessed with but one idea he cleared the last four steps with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three parts empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left				840.7320133783954

he left gorgone on his right and la pianosa on his left and went towards the country of paoli and napoleon				52071.32447743907
we are so good and gentle to your eminence				1956.1311676471369
at the same moment whilst d artagnan was leaning over the aperture to listen a metallic sound as if some one was moving a bag of gold struck on his ear he started instantly afterward a door opened and a light played upon the staircase				2832.0962205516407
you refuse me my liberty god will give it me and the abbé casting away his coverlet resumed his place and continued his calculations				106864.71847887276
he turned around recognized athos and aramis and held out his hand to them				106.81101297688801

you understand that you are in no way obliged to go with me come now said athos you are joking in that case my dear friend if you are resolved to accompany me there is no time to lose the drum beats i observed cannon on the road i saw the citizens in order of battle on the place of the hotel de ville certainly the fight will be in the direction of charenton as the duc de chatillon said i supposed said athos that last night s conferences would modify those warlike arrangements no doubt but they will fight none the less if only to mask the conferences poor creatures said athos who are going to be killed in order that monsieur de bouillon may have his estate at sedan restored to him that the reversion of the admiralty may be given to the duc de beaufort and that the coadjutor may be made a cardinal come come dear athos confess that you would not be so philosophical if your raoul were to be involved in this affair perhaps you speak the truth aramis well let us go then where the fighting is for that is the most likely place to meet with d artagnan porthos and possibly even raoul				539.5694379438639

for a moment d artagnan thought that parry s brother had disappeared but he was mistaken				1830.0582588200298
i mean that they have killed an enemy which is a very different thing returned the captain				1152.241236213896

it was then that he saw a horseman as it were detach himself from the wall and follow him at a little distance				2216.9347707881348
i think it would be well to sleep here and to start again very early to morrow				2136.8947709081203
d artagnan on his side went up to the landlady praised her wine which was a horrible production from the country of montreuil and heard from her that there were only two houses of importance in the village one of these belonged to the archbishop of paris and was at that time the abode of his niece the duchess of longueville the other was a convent of jesuits and was the property a by no means unusual circumstance of these worthy fathers				12368.719569768344
a firm and well practised hand was engaged in cutting the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond				1449.6370155918378
he seized a rope which dantès flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor climbed up the side of the ship while the young man going to his task left the conversation to danglars who now came towards the owner				17358.225180232945
when he had finished with the orange tree he began at the cactus but this not being so easily plucked as the orange tree pricked him dreadfully				1005781.8035725406
m de tréville who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it related it in all its details to his eminence not forgetting the episode of the napkin				89977.53024632258
when mazarin ceased speaking he said to porthos in a low tone never tell mazarin that i understand spanish or i am a lost man and you are also all right said porthos				147.39019782280445
yes continued the young man all is now explained with this key i open the abyss				13251.854907514611
i have no fear of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day				377.3626110577917

you promised to obey me implicitly				730647.2734301587
every one arose				2250.755733465289
we have our clothes some more splendid than others this is our credit but when a man dies he has only his skin in the same way on retiring from business you have nothing but your real principal of about five or six millions at the most for third rate fortunes are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it				88.43626841690386
let us see said the queen what the count says and she opened the letter and read madame being unable to have the honor of writing to you myself by reason of a wound i have received in my right hand i have commanded my son the count de guiche who with his father is equally your humble servant to write to tell you that we have just gained the battle of lens and that this victory can not fail to give great power to cardinal mazarin and to the queen over the affairs of europe				2596.7865811655793
no she replied it is for my poor grandmother				90717.22666451364
then he raised the flag stone cautiously with his head and looked carefully around the chamber				547.6270251981222
i shall tell him therefore and in doing so i shall confer a personal favor on him how he is mistaken in regard to me				92.1310441063001
the coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the direction he was desired never doubting but that the order had come from his master				1331.4223756923896
gentlemen replied d artagnan i have already received by monsieur de cavois a similar invitation from his eminence				1904.7333815164043
oh come gentlemen my master is ill the three friends hastened toward d artagnan who instead of being ill ran toward his horse				904.7172217409352
those were the count s windows why he must be a nabob				1404550.191555964
i know that a duel between us two would be a serious affair because you are brave and i am brave also				1424.8607608161742
i have heard here and there that this sister in law was a hussy				1154428.5089686685
the servants passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous day as if they had always inhabited the house others filling the coach houses where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years and in the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters				2866.212541122074
i believe so i don t know it s of no consequence				46658.23087023491
well i understand what i now have to do replied villefort				179.82689020442126

richelieu and now said athos resuming his cloak and putting on his hat now that i have drawn your teeth viper bite if you can and he left the chamber without once looking behind him				32.22285678384287
the englishman received his thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and morrel overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the staircase				2880.0057269303807
i see nothing but faces a yard broad in short it seems to me that nature herself wears a holiday garb and that the trees instead of leaves and flowers are covered with red and green ribbons as on gala days as for me said planchet i seem to smell from this place even a most delectable perfume of fine roast meat and to see the scullions in a row by the hedge hailing our approach				3305.0964656009974
but in such a situation a single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty				14111.006690391216
my lord you are right and i am glad to see that you do justice to the count at last				3175.4564750707345
the party assembled the room was lighted with waxlights and the prisoner with a bit of plaster he had taken out of the wall of his room had traced a long white line representing a cord on the floor				1225.767433258668
what a horrible scene				4854.995262108631

grimaud showed his closed hand with two fingers spread out				490.6697121094197
the usurper converted decidedly my dear duke in what way converted to good principles				157812.50671132197
d artagnan gave the open letter to kitty who at first was unable to comprehend it but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time				694.9868054444755
now here montaran we will do better than that let each take a half of the handkerchief yes perfectly just cried the other two guardsmen the judgment of king solomon				1378300.9126046174
then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the colosseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled				17627.172529254818
the butt end of the musket hovered over his head and he could scarcely restrain himself from closing his eyes when with one bound guiche reached the spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat				2485.299894091095
but my good gentleman resumed the old man upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done do not take on so they did not kill her and that s a comfort can you guess said d artagnan who was the man who headed this infernal expedition i don t know him but as you spoke to him you must have seen him oh it s a description you want exactly so a tall dark man with black mustaches dark eyes and the air of a gentleman that s the man cried d artagnan again he forever he				638.7198766291622
ah said morrel falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of despair ah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words because their screams annoy them				110.22163372714812
danglars is his banker is he not asked château renaud of debray				381.0887412640929
in five minutes it will be too late mme				174.6014771414759
as ten o clock was striking d artagnan left m de tréville who thanked him for his information recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart and returned to the saloon but at the foot of the stairs d artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane				9890.34311789102
i lost madame du vallon two years ago he said and you find me still in affliction on that account				2064.640525380184
the order of battle on the morrow was to be that of the positions taken in the evening				602.5888380899315
i will show you the way and he went in first				791.1221473854994
ah i know said she lowering her voice and going close to the old man				138.76147112031646
he was thinking of these matters when porthos summoned him to dinner				2095.148840009232
for three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic on the third the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow				746311.0283188557
you must depart instantly monsieur				872.1095366402068
you see said the king that it is useless for you to resist				1071486.7457376146
the damps of the dew bathed the head of villefort and refreshed his memory				2157.5194118937297
here is the prisoner let us attend to what is most pressing the prisoner was one of those military adventurers who sold their blood to whoever would buy and grew old in stratagems and spoils				1177207.6751136347
ah cried valentine suddenly i understand				774.518624618633
does monsieur de bragelonne remain in paris she inquired				2753.151980371298
no madame but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends and porthos turning on his heel made a step to retire				3833.0613361654023
the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired				40788.00110696263
athos is near you said d artagnan warn him as i have warned you aramis easily aroused athos whose sleep was light like that of all persons of a finely organized constitution				6025754.104844952
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her bed and it was in her own room and from the lips of madame de villefort that she heard all the strange events we have related we mean the flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti or rather benedetto together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him				35.66515514293431
read this word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe				10518.380363550405
monsieur d artagnan is not rich and has need of his position as lieutenant to enable him to live				2073.704942029228
grimaud who held the piece of glass in his hand said sharp true my lord exclaimed la ramee				1457.8673936581374
instead of aiding the movements of my horse i paralyzed them and i was just going to drown myself with the best grace in the world when you arrived just in time to pull me out of the water therefore sir if you will agree henceforward we are friends until death sir replied raoul bowing i am entirely at your service i assure you i am called the count de guiche continued the young man my father is the marechal de grammont and now that you know who i am do me the honor to inform me who you are i am the viscount de bragelonne answered raoul blushing at being unable to name his father as the count de guiche had done				1454.7244680024698
yes yes				1443.0954010116106

i have lent him to a friend who will understand the signs he makes returned d artagnan				60.195586130840205
i am half an hour in advance of them an hour perhaps				4693.09653289331
someone is coming				12332.08919726688
well said the queen it has been refused the two friends exchanged a smile of contempt				6550.691260859339
thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible story is recited in the chimney corner and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be swallowed by the deep then the count added aloud was his name ever known oh yes but only as no				1038.334779320254
this celebrated woman fully understood the art of being dull with dignity				9981.812196209861
a man was introduced of simple mien who had the appearance of a tradesman				840341.3148785793
the two musketeers arrived in their turn holding the horses of d artagnan and porthos in their hands				556.9555570736154
he had scarcely done so before the door opened and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual on the side of his bed				764.7673475460159
well said morcerf for three days i believed myself the object of the attentions of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppæa while i was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl				1098.0323261355784
it followed that d artagnan who was as yet purely and simply in the guards found himself for the time at least separated from his good friends athos porthos and aramis				207.5846775432949
ah my young friend added the curate groaning do not regret the devil i implore you d artagnan felt himself bewildered				10658.3446154232
why it is a rank of itself in france and from the way in which you lavish money it is a place that must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year a hundred thousand francs				1468.4484848709787
this was the young man whom his mother and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure				5437.150092766751
the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of villefort who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes				88185.80686995375
unquestionably edmond s star is in the ascendant and he will marry the splendid girl he will be captain too and laugh at us all unless a sinister smile passed over danglars lips unless i take a hand in the affair he added				4347.878541871005
the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the ground				614.1384400099803
if you are outside the united states check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading copying displaying performing distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other project gutenberg™ work				1617.1854105935074
it is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other				393.09675089707474
by heaven at last said athos the first to speak by this time i think all must be over here my lords				604485.9999575451
he saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with english gold was strangely repugnant to him				35.12295194520441
rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs				1760.288901184181
he went afterward to the innkeeper and bought from him two hundred trusses at the same price				104610.04332858078
what has the count done				1388.8983197754362
remember that was the only means				3851.5660957258883
it is all as he has said it is very evident that the mind still retains its full force and vigor then turning towards the paralytic he said you possess then francs of capital which according to the manner in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about livres yes to whom do you desire to leave this fortune oh said madame de villefort there is not much doubt on that subject				1153.4077197752151
this was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate in which i intended to carry off valentine to my sister s house to marry her and to wait respectfully m de villefort s pardon no said noirtier				1811.1056097843202
why don t we go in with them asked porthos				85.89986182727887
d artagnan then remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility till he came to this unlucky city of meung				679260.8689535855
beauchamp wished to go in alone but albert observed that as this was an unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels				1217458.0722888228

monsieur du tremblay received d artagnan with extreme politeness and invited him to sit down with him to supper of which he was himself about to partake				1043824.8364787489
the commissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to dantès as if struck on his heart				391.54666133375514
i remember now yes it was about stop a minute yes it was about a woman that s it replied athos becoming almost livid that is my grand story of the fair lady and when i relate that i must be very drunk yes that was it said d artagnan the story of a tall fair lady with blue eyes yes who was hanged by her husband who was a nobleman of your acquaintance continued d artagnan looking intently at athos				160.70544488239398
yes shall i give these papers to m de villefort no to mademoiselle valentine no to m franz d épinay yes franz astonished advanced a step				1485.1078626952628
morrel bent his head till it touched the stone then clutching the grating with both hands he murmured oh valentine the count s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words he stepped forward and touching the young man s shoulder said i was looking for you my friend monte cristo expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for morrel turning round said calmly you see i was praying the scrutinizing glance of the count searched the young man from head to foot				1306.0551544470004

on the corner of a mantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor but cried morrel this purse is not yours julie handed to her father the letter she had received in the morning				411.64630175369535
she will soon get over these things so saying madame de saint méran extended her dry bony hand to villefort who while imprinting a son in law s respectful salute on it looked at renée as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear hand i kiss as it should have been these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor renée				17371.970517206035
instead of that air of life of comfort and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business establishment instead of merry faces at the windows busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors instead of the court filled with bales of goods re echoing with the cries and the jokes of porters one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom				107863.22110217977
this one will not oppress you by his dignity tis the same thing you understand me d artagnan a court there s no court now				1274.8651215512111

the other was that which laporte had placed in the hands of the duke of buckingham warning him that he was about to be assassinated that communication had arrived too late				2064.396384480418
for you and your comrades this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even porthos and this french generosity repeated by lord de winter and his friend was highly applauded except by mm				6731.994199811534
it is of very little consequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry feeling or not against dantès				578.4121707062824
but she has not died of old age but of grief it appears that since the death of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her reason but of what disease then did she die asked debray				429.80991297307395

no vampire cried beauchamp				411.6543496507258
although the coadjutor had preached that same morning it was well known that he leaned much to the side of the fronde and mazarin in requesting the archbishop of paris to make his nephew preach had evidently had the intention of administering to monsieur de retz one of those italian kicks he so much enjoyed giving				1222514.5038855958
the dappled grays the baron followed by the count traversed a long series of apartments in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of madame danglars a small octagonal shaped room hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin				828397.8093276927
but no on reflection the procureur was not a merciless man and it was not the magistrate slave to his duties but the friend the loyal friend who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the honor of danglars from ignominious association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their son in law				1718.339756547929

give me a light shall i accompany you monsieur no it is unnecessary bertuccio will show me a light and monte cristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces which produced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge				12513.157631752974
from the apartments on the ground floor might be heard the sound of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of light shone through the openings of the venetian blinds				66843.49893259366

in a quarter of an hour athos joined them and at the same moment charles brought in a letter for d artagnan which a messenger had just desired might be instantly delivered				179498.1926011932
then the count brought the taper to the window that it might be seen in the champs élysées that a man was getting out of the window while another held a light				1149.185511586664
at this moment emmanuel entered his countenance full of animation and joy				1121.282323405439
i disturb you perhaps my dear aramis continued d artagnan for by what i see i am led to believe that you are confessing to these gentlemen aramis colored imperceptibly				13804.134487518691
where is the count where is haydée look said jacopo				15071.871056173411
on the evening of the ball teresa was attired in her best her most brilliant ornaments in her hair and gayest glass beads she was in the costume of the women of frascati				1317008.8733652004
that glance was so sharp that it penetrated the heart of mazarin who reading in it a declaration of war seized d artagnan by the arm and said if occasion requires monsieur you will remember that man who has just gone out will you not yes my lord he replied				8362.41653645622

franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert s request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon				3678.275679795861
who is this young person m de morcerf inquired eugénie does anybody know mademoiselle said albert replying to this direct appeal i can give you very exact information on that subject as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing the young woman is a greek so i should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that everyone here is as well informed as yourself i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone replied morcerf but i am reluctantly obliged to confess i have nothing further to communicate yes stay i do know one thing more namely that she is a musician for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting with the count i heard the sound of a guzla it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own then your count entertains visitors does he asked madame danglars				360.19766365323557

i will efface that blot on my father s character				9268.974477066522
ten minutes elapsed during which d artagnan made every effort to read through the first envelope what was written on the second				1043.406225621681
in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs d œuvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grétry and porpora				1125494.4255487956
immediately the window was opened and a ladder of rope was let down from it				97.4227348566297
the same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated the instant afterward the flaming globe descended afresh and i was completely alone				1062.7209959580894
it was true and raoul was convinced that some accident had happened and that a man was drowning he gave his horse its head struck his spurs into its sides and the animal urged by pain and feeling that he had space open before him bounded over a kind of paling which inclosed the landing place and fell into the river scattering to a distance waves of white froth				947567.9232213403
deuce take em what a popular commotion continued the giant in his quiet manner but i knocked down more than twenty with the hilt of balizarde				181442.32668213485
by degrees milady became more communicative				1399637.5408807073
the result of these reflections was that d artagnan without asking information of any kind alighted commended the horses to the care of his lackey entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight				8657.647808356322
i should be glad however to receive your excellency s commands concerning the dinner really my dear m bertuccio said the count since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me but surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so				445.1893845691713
at the third knock however steps were heard inside				9077.940586756185
my dear d artagnan said he if you please we will join our friends as i am rich we will today begin to dine together again expecting that you will be rich in your turn my faith said d artagnan with great pleasure				1249.4531017696693
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor it is from no personal ill feeling towards the viscount that is all i can say sir replied danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as he perceived that morcerf was a little softened and calmed down				623.0097733772338
richelieu whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now praise after his death was even less popular than i am				2568.2678377233483
was he the man that stabbed you yes said the executioner				1505.257193352888
a man carrying a long switch with a nail at the end of it with which he urged on his slow team was walking with the cart				106890.81168310864
it resulted then from this habit that on the said first monday of april the citizens on hearing the clamor and seeing neither the red and yellow standard nor the livery of the duc de richelieu rushed toward the hostel of the jolly miller				869713.8537338591
nine days after leaving the charente pale with fatigue and vexation milady saw only the blue coasts of finisterre appear				6104.483347429446
no nothing at all				205.08545039431982
then he went out				379.4432199147336
the memory of richelieu annihilates me				79.46348010638793
ah here is one of them i believe in fact at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared				1148.223123849306
this insolent boy chastises others cried he and i hope that this time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before will not escape him replied the stranger knitting his brow				429.90051012711996
valentine was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which pervaded that house and they flew into the passage crying for help				3776.1300341559186
he kept his word				420.60179664426187
at first on arriving at the door through which mazarin had passed d artagnan tried in vain to open it but on the powerful shoulder of porthos being applied to one of the panels which gave way d artagnan introduced the point of his sword between the bolt and the staple of the lock				100120.29893649275
as to d artagnan he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of the two men in black				116227.33948000065
de villefort replied the doctor with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection				1419918.5073739174
a priest can understand a father s grief and m de villefort giving the key to d avrigny again bade farewell to the strange doctor and retired to his study where he began to work				1627.7527068753463
orders were given that no drum should be beaten no trumpet sounded				7672.2700326612585
barrois said valentine shut the door and let no one come in she passed first				781.372313583554
sit down in mercy d artagnan mute with anger and anxiety took a seat in the threatening attitude of a judge				5576.640536979745
the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment				72374.86111860051
the jailer always brought dantès soup in an iron saucepan this saucepan contained soup for both prisoners for dantès had noticed that it was either quite full or half empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his companion first				797.7978158259482
it was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome				1190966.0982603931
i am her best friend upon my honor said rochefort it takes you my dear countess to perform such miracles and it is well i can chevalier said milady for do you know what is going on here no they will come for her tomorrow or the day after with an order from the queen indeed				957.9884668653795
yes sir answered mousqueton but permit me to say i see nothing laughable in it				80.09603839834851
the accusation no the letter are you sure i saw it done that alters the case				3449.589090968137
a sort of book written upon strips of cloth go and fetch it my good fellow and if it be what i hope you will do well i will run for it sir and the guide went out				502.0493901408908
julie threw herself into his arms				503.95379567607165
buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance				2275.3440070182337
well said porthos seated in the courtyard of the hotel de la chevrette to d artagnan who with a long and melancholy face had returned from the palais royal did he receive you ungraciously my dear friend i faith yes				1445.430019351817
what the devil				539.991553254375
hastily raising myself on one arm i looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the room above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my forehead and when i passed my hand across my brow i felt that it was wet and clammy				2135870.1570808236
they promised indeed to negotiate with the pope for a cardinal s hat for him but he knew how little reliance should be placed on such promises made by the queen and mazarin				473.9389202045724
we have had great annoyances there				613.2412362266911
d artagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same instant the one to recover the other to obtain the sword but d artagnan being the more active reached it first and placed his foot upon it				95.09635422860681
an officer approached				2846.2816299418328
the count of monte cristo is unquestionably a man of first rate breeding and knowledge of the world then you accept his offer said the host				602.9915313698648
struck in the breast and extending his arms the spaniard fell back on the crupper and the terrified horse turning around carried him off				1409.323361324734
i leave you therefore as i took you rich but little respected				308943.87868076353
moreover other ideas much more enthralling occupied his mind				692.4410593886817
the three musketeers possessed by this idea the cardinal resolved to know all about d artagnan immediately of course he could not inquire from d artagnan himself who he was and what had been his career he remarked however in the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke with a gascon accent				1258.5917526337812
felton in his turn a suppliant clasped his hands				496.13243608601715
a week before he had received in a cradle a beautiful little boy three months old with a purse filled with gold and a note containing these simple words october it was the date of that strange adventure interrupted madame de chevreuse				2097.0368858687507
they were very happy				6504.30196715305
he had not the less decided upon setting out that same evening and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to him he persisted in having the review hoping by setting it at defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him				38.41586025379545
i warn you however his services will cost you something				5626.293873258053
it was almost broad daylight				4125.169876751377
d artagnan determined upon his course				2832.7809808186853
the count of monte cristo she murmured				7427.388050409565
i wish my life to be free and open				1482.4596039903183
however as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last chance and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new misfortune befell them the gallery on the sea side which had long been in ruins was rebuilt				1209441.9269841837
that s it				71.86537510387149
a horse is mortal suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy d artagnan did not smile				531.1702483390385
as he could not leave his chamber it was necessary to charge us with this commission and then instead of putting the letter in the post which is never safe i took advantage of the journey of one of my lads to paris and ordered him to convey the letter to this duchess himself				188.29698428880764
ten minutes afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor				100652.97366280452
d artagnan mounted the staircase followed by his prisoner who in his turn was followed by the soldier and entered mazarin s ante room				195.85717833919813
your very devoted husband baron danglars the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful letter and saw him notwithstanding his self control change color once or twice				3734.3940291041567
then your excellency is going to the hotel casa pastrini said the cicerone to the coachman and the carriage drove rapidly on				1313.8417953796134
i try to be beloved not feared well there is on the wall of my cell scratched with a nail a proverb which says like master like servant pray what does that mean it means that monsieur de richelieu was able to find trusty servants dozens and dozens of them he				579.3263698796026
i am here what do you want with me and at these words the musketeer in irreproachable costume belted as usual with a tolerably firm step entered the cabinet				6176.388052830761
my captain is dead i have barely escaped but i am a good sailor				1915.7914837293488
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with papers				3499.470715936739
perhaps i may one day put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great gate introduce myself				764.9478802480428
monsieur bonacieux there was in all this as may have been observed one personage concerned of whom notwithstanding his precarious position we have appeared to take but very little notice				6761.604567516097
what object think you have this expedition to ré and this league with the protestants of la rochelle which i am projecting				922973.9878143726
do you not know these bits of paper bank notes exactly there are fifteen of them and whose are they yours if you like mine exclaimed the man half suffocated				140550.8874076783
she ground her teeth she was of the color of ashes				41357.05105069091
the favorite of two kings immensely rich all powerful in a kingdom which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice george villiers duke of buckingham had lived one of those fabulous existences which survive in the course of centuries to astonish posterity				863009.8808084995
a moment later the gray headed man was beside him				34.01512104710958
fortunately however he had not been taken the people believing that he had escaped by some back entrance retired and left him at liberty to retreat				1546.4091922901528
all this is very strange and i am curious to know how it will end badly monsieur badly replied a voice which the young man recognized as that of planchet for soliloquizing aloud as very preoccupied people do he had entered the alley at the end of which were the stairs which led to his chamber				527.4620378859121
besides in addition to the pioneers there are four soldiers and a brigadier armed with muskets that s because they don t see us said athos				189.79879305696355
i was informed that i was prisoner until i paid the sum of roman crowns about francs				1472.5476279330958
so that in spite of edicts ordinances and decrees there he is captain of the musketeers that is to say chief of a legion of cæsars whom the king holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads he who dreads nothing as it is said				477.4108301995686
this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon greatly				9513.400450583411
lord de winter on quitting d artagnan gave him his sister s address				7668.890393988213
tell him answered the brave man to let the king know that they have not killed me outright				1687628.3575563894
shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor and the young lieutenant with whom we are already acquainted stopped at the threshold to receive the orders of the baron				7165.439301848327
mazarin is almost king answered athos madame henrietta is almost no longer queen if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis i really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de voiture athos smiled				467.5060548098833
oh d artagnan my beloved d artagnan				21.3455131432518
what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from one far less pure				31941.097690721537
a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house				517.8468620429544
then as we have said the young girl left the bedside to see m noirtier				1787.407591068963
i am at home here and i alone have a right to raise my voice above another s				867.8549475155932
my faith replied d artagnan you are well named gentlemen and my adventure if it should make any noise will prove at least that your union is not founded upon contrasts in the meantime porthos had come up waved his hand to athos and then turning toward d artagnan stood quite astonished				2316.0384258397594
you have heard what i said				174.3550455408193
it is impossible said maximilian that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions				1172778.1045411776
does this man know your majesty personally inquired aramis				45.062187486980264
this manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest effect on the two young men who continued their conversation				578.3068214865319
think what a figure you will make when you are asked how do they execute at rome and you reply i do not know and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own son				893.3735876872566
but what are you doing				3265.5505930180097
as for the remission of your sins we have the archbishop of paris who has the very greatest power at the court of rome and even the coadjutor who possesses some plenary indulgences we will recommend you to him consider maillard said the curate that i have recommended you to this gentleman who is a powerful lord and that i have made myself responsible for you i know monsieur le curé said the beggar that you have always been very kind to me and therefore i in my turn will be serviceable to you and do you think your power as great with the fraternity as monsieur le curé told me it was just now i think they have some esteem for me said the mendicant with pride and that not only will they obey me but wherever i go they will follow me and could you count on fifty resolute men good unemployed but active souls brawlers capable of bringing down the walls of the palais royal by crying down with mazarin as fell those at jericho i think said the beggar i can undertake things more difficult and more important than that ah ah said gondy you will undertake then some night to throw up some ten barricades i will undertake to throw up fifty and when the day comes to defend them i faith exclaimed gondy you speak with a certainty that gives me pleasure and since monsieur le curé can answer for you i answer for him said the curate				4015.0796402105916
they are too much taken up with interfering in the affairs of their countrymen who travel now you get angry and attack our poor agents				1109485.4318218206
yes very well				506.31621628662754
days and weeks passed away then months dantès still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight				5542.046383551381
patience athos				33.018890901631025
the sudden departure of franz after being summoned by m noirtier had so much astonished everyone that the position of madame de villefort left alone with the notary and the witnesses became every moment more embarrassing				1420903.3083694174
has anyone brought a letter for me asked d artagnan eagerly				1718.4700410379312
i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my dinner or in the middle of the night i resolve on starting for some particular point and away i go the count rang and a footman appeared				1146.8464009813717
you suppose that i would ever accept the price of your life				571.0827838884271
be satisfied said d artagnan laughing porthos will pay you with the money of the duchess coquenard oh monsieur procurator s wife or duchess if she will but loosen her pursestrings it will be all the same but she positively answered that she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of monsieur porthos and that she would not send him a denier and did you convey this answer to your guest we took good care not to do that he would have found in what fashion we had executed his commission so that he still expects his money oh lord yes monsieur				1051.3601289711326
all right all right said the jailer all right since you will have it so				469.34119292637854
and what have i to do with your ill humor said the baroness irritated at the impassibility of her husband do these things concern me				82.55569275399783
still they may have concealed some precious stone some valuable diamond so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures				42357.55395504948
and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter i give you my word of honor sir said dantès but what is the matter				1380.2495144734335
rely on me d artagnan knew that although a gascon m de tréville was not in the habit of making promises and that when by chance he did promise he more than kept his word				468.98414509026657
and who has seen this fleur de lis inquired aramis				114.06649834402535
i shall seek not mazarin but the queen and say to her madame restore to us your two servants and our two friends aramis shook his head				379.9264365197914
the man took his way toward the city				1028.8640744667018
the catalans chapter				245.66345171275535
the young woman in the street replied by a single tap and the shutter was opened a little way				872.4614202923098
it is my turn to be of use to her do not envy me this happiness comminges bowed and left				819.6466001559589
never did a gamester whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die experience the anguish which edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope				1325.5817074461659
laughingly he said to the councillor restored to his family do you think father that if now i should ask for a company the queen would give it to me d artagnan profited by this interval of calm to send away raoul whom he had great difficulty in keeping shut up during the riot and who wished positively to strike a blow for one party or the other				392.26145578281097
i told him i would attend to the prisoners in his absence				3792.0990072244335
mazarin turned again to his papers				3205.2917761619983
is she there grimaud asked athos				6.2520734474573665
the day before yesterday was a fish day and they had nothing but meat what said athos no fish at a seaport they say said aramis resuming his pious reading that the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea but that is not quite what i mean to ask you aramis replied athos				125.45269183443824
although he was a perfect stranger in the court of m de tréville s courtiers and this his first appearance in that place he was at length noticed and somebody came and asked him what he wanted				14239.472706072085
go d artagnan go grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon a half hour afterward d artagnan returned with the two thousand livres and without having met with any accident				2544.878939387916
your quarrels with the parliament your noisy dissensions with the princes who fight for you to day and to morrow will fight against you the popular following directed by the coadjutor president blancmesnil and councillor broussel all that disorder in short which pervades the several departments of the state must lead you to view with uneasiness the possibility of a foreign war for in that event england exalted by the enthusiasm of new ideas will ally herself with spain already seeking that alliance				30655.99667741425
three times athos knocked without receiving an answer				870.5274005733847
you know you may say anything to me				69.00372048932793
the count had spoken correctly				55413.674403644276
then he came to the corridor all the doors of which he found open so too was the door of athos s chamber and that of the park				10745.98631355369
two horsemen going out as athos and aramis entered were obliged to give place to them				105.27717780076352
be kind enough then to send me francs tomorrow				1853.1638008966613
dantès might have waited until the evening visit was over but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier				147252.94659147246
a few minutes more and the troop passed over their heads				5812.658241829341
he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water it was the general s body which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead				519.4984796506089
albert had you been a stranger a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble but i thought this mark of consideration due to you				62.63862060750268
bonacieux the man resembled aramis so much as to be mistaken for him				34.81734162885431
these gentlemen are with me said winter				879.8838627556412
along the isle of dogs and perhaps you have a preference for one boat more than another				1201.6635114113844
maximilian in his devotedness gazed silently at her				192.5457937202702
what ails you my dearest father				647.9163240959034
the voice and gesture of the man who followed danglars ordered him to do the same				1125.4642640448628
for a year he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy				1121766.4109469678
we will see gentlemen we will see				869.8170396848423
who knows if they will not manage to restore to me my pension				1255042.2391591044
his was one of those rare organizations endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog with a blind valor a quick eye and a prompt hand to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone and the hand to strike this displeasing personage whether a besme a maurevers a poltiot de méré or a vitry				760356.0224931588
when i live at auteuil you must come there as you belong to my service bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master and remained motionless without making any answer				829.1497766117567
believe me there are only the two plans i have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer				786358.9209556594
you tell me said franz at the moment signor pastrini was about to open his mouth that you knew luigi vampa when he was a child he is still a young man then a young man				132.59230357691828
the unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness				1031.5536221202917
one chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent bertuccio				1890.2891620848
blaisois replied mousqueton remember that bread is the true nourishment of a frenchman who is not always able to get bread ask grimaud yes but beer asked blaisois sharply is that their true drink as to that answered mousqueton puzzled how to get out of the difficulty i must confess that to me beer is as disagreeable as wine is to the english what				629.9933277872617

athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned				99478.62332218922
now as these questions involved matters of gravest consequence it was these to which the prince had especially desired an answer exact precise positive				618278.2690812856
prince cavalcanti said danglars who persisted in giving the young man that title				5511.770578146595
there is the subject simplified				1747520.9209951141

the horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where morrel had often waited				17819.671757197964

the guards asked permission of la ramee who gave it to them but not till the evening however until then he had business and the prisoner was not to be left alone				1044.0402776034452

friend porthos said d artagnan handing the letter to him this time at least you are sure of your title of baron and i of my captaincy				1243451.4385828006

and wonderful to see in front of the tower of saint jean was a ship bearing on her stern these words printed in white letters the pharaon morrel son of marseilles she was the exact duplicate of the other pharaon and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo				98458.90793257373
but as porthos on his side could not comprehend his astonishment he merely pushed him indoors saying let us go in they found athos in profound despondency aramis looked first at porthos and then at d artagnan without speaking but the latter understood his meaningful look				1707.1949559431262

if you know a prayer say it for you are condemned and you shall die at these words which left no hope milady raised herself in all her pride and wished to speak but her strength failed her				187.38936710311492

the coadjutor bowed and left the palace casting upon the cardinal such a glance as is best understood by mortal foes				28853.3225188414
i felt pain i wished to cry out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed				1932.7811219282385
he is moving and if he has taken off his mask i shall be able to see				1009.9296133592792
ah my dear aramis this time i shall find you out and d artagnan making himself as small as he could concealed himself in the darkest side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche				1270753.3456737616
athos alone from time to time raised his expansive brow a flash kindled in his eyes and a bitter smile passed over his lips then like his comrades he sank again into reverie				4241.942276445172
villefort therefore gained nothing save the king s gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present time and the cross of the legion of honor which he had the prudence not to wear although m de blacas had duly forwarded the brevet				1089819.4915551078
yes without the saddle you will observe gentlemen said athos that porthos has made the best bargain of any of us and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined to the astonishment of poor porthos but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity he shared it vociferously according to his custom				19110.115836009052
a frondeur				58940.932459893564
but he was continually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion and anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy				869166.6062926971
the unknown day for which dantès had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open eyes again dawned				682757.5592778167
a little sooner or a little later it isn t worth quarreling over if i am astonished at anything remarked porthos sententiously it is that it has not already happened oh it will happen you may be sure said d artagnan				58.763625208986845
if you wish it i am at your service my lord i protest my dear la ramee said the duke that you are a charming fellow and that i would stay forever at vincennes to have the pleasure of your society my lord replied la ramee i think if it depended on the cardinal your wishes would be fulfilled what do you mean				5970.829331759392
gentlemen said morrel reading all that passed through the minds of the witnesses to the scene i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to say valentine has been assassinated villefort hung his head d avrigny approached nearer and noirtier said yes with his eyes				594.5756158509154
come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last visit to st peter s franz silently assented and the following afternoon at half past five o clock the young men parted				177380.7530393262
the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor				1036521.8610747466
the remains of poor renée were already deposited there and now after ten years of separation her father and mother were to be reunited with her				207.52935281204157
but what has become of m d épinay replied morrel				161.96154841053772
all attempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets or silence their exclamations were in vain				1733.6370437223181
i had fixed the embarkation for the twenty fourth but i have reflected that the more promptly the affair takes place the more sure it will be				881.6074283225414
diavolo said the cardinal pensively gazing at the two friends with lively admiration i should have cried i should at this moment the tumult was heard nearer				14035.297861913277
the return d artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of athos yet many things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation				768944.7730441684
come you shall take charge of the money i of the jewel box so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure the other would still have hers left				800.9508614593165
the next morning at nine o clock he entered franz s room followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on fête days				503.72267634159266
these conditions being agreed to porthos took leave of mme				197.05343235303528

the curtain rose on the ballet which was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art one of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same time and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but one mind one act of volition influenced the moving mass				7444.549454440867
i may have been mistaken at this moment the young man returned danglars withdrew				2234.3362560420123
well said she returning the knife to the young officer this is fine and good steel				178484.75196166988
at once if you please and you know who i am without doubt i				1042.1730684526847
he arrived valentine was expecting him				28.250217864663004
it was the first billet he had received it was the first rendezvous that had been granted him				32.601445952800184
and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked debray				342.98755650295465
we shall soon see how to dispose he continued of the parliament				14550.082518668776
monsieur said the count to albert i do not ask you to accompany me to my house as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise				2059.207354537297
keep guard at the other door athos and aramis				192.49245776210398
by jove				56402.70127227916
the three friends ordered breakfast and went into a room in which the host said they would not be disturbed				350315.39796698303
albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea				1125.0655939277272
d artagnan remained fixed to the spot astounded and not knowing what to think				7209.54805186048
for us also inquired athos				10.10518201164969
have you then so much confidence in your servant that you can intrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know our coachman is a member of the club said the president we shall be driven by a state councillor then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly				36005.996499953624
this rochefort cried porthos if i were the esquire of poor chalais should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me and you you would pass rather a sad quarter hour with the red duke replied aramis				198.40849784585654
in the corridor he met mme				58.46596142150948
it was not your opinion that i asked said the queen sharply without even turning around				2070.3861556415036
they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier				71735.52062490262
i was seeking the gentleman to whom this horse belongs an officer brave and handsome as a youthful caesar then pretending to see raoul for the first time ah				568.5103310367784
chapter xvii				25689.63612739931
they were anxious about you here i simply told them where you were				9195.027370522073
but the sight of an old man clinging to life with so desperate a courage gave a fresh turn to his ideas and inspired him with new courage				2570.768555947778
i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose anything else replied villefort with a look so fixed it indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and madness				27535.104875548062
come come we must be off				1448.580493609818
who was the youth he had adopted and who bore so striking a resemblance to him				34.353456272868314
he decided therefore not only to fetch the order but the two thousand pistoles at which he estimated the prisoners				1871.9316467512072
you face the insinuations of the pelagians and the semi pelagians but my reverend replied aramis a little amazed by the shower of arguments that poured upon his head				342.4061417572751
the young count witty and caustic passed all the world in review the queen herself was not spared and cardinal mazarin came in for his share of ridicule				4181.325893491473
only in order to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he wishes you to relate to him as i have done already the miraculous manner in which the diamond came into our possession				2493.8305099154813
to quote some latin verses i have forgotten or rather never knew well the thunderbolt never falls on the valleys and i am a valley dear rochefort one of the lowliest of the low then mazarin is still mazarin the same as ever my friend it is said that he is married to the queen married if not her husband he is unquestionably her lover you surprise me				82.211569124571
indeed i feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a first rate paris tailor probably blin or humann				766894.2079961254
oh i remember said d artagnan				7.510235495054319
you can not mean that ah my dear monsieur bonacieux you are generous in this matter				1326.3195578014772
live then and be happy beloved children of my heart and never forget that until the day when god shall deign to reveal the future to man all human wisdom is summed up in these two words wait and hope your friend edmond dantès count of monte cristo during the perusal of this letter which informed valentine for the first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother she became pale a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom and tears not the less painful because they were silent ran down her cheeks her happiness cost her very dear				21480.61045071882
i madame replied he follow monsieur de la fere wherever he leads even were it on to death without demanding wherefore but when it concerns your majesty s service then added he looking at the queen with all the grace of former days i precede the count well then gentlemen said the queen since it is thus and since you are willing to devote yourselves to the service of a poor princess whom the whole world has abandoned this is what is required to be done for me				86.56441878539509
it was completely deserted				6469.916982140873
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint cry threw herself back in her seat				1036.1713961410376
he may have fallen from his horse he may have cut a caper from the deck he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have brought on a violent catarrh				1158436.2977675786
he decided then to tell all				240.60112241529222
your betrothed valentine de villefort p s my poor grandmother gets worse and worse yesterday her fever amounted to delirium today her delirium is almost madness				26523.97624980227
you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude				26302.15913108602
well baron i promise you some good exercise said the gascon				1178.9034568918853
two ladies sleeping in one bed were awakened by the noise and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded they saw a man				150.95475727187548
he was therefore about to return to the palazzo bracciano without loss of time when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind				712.5204087576953
they are robbers perhaps he muttered				4947.787309166079
at this moment the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy nothing was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry				824.1814852101916
why in the first place i gave you fifty you think so pardieu ah that is true				1075.9075725893472
then following the clew that in the hands of the abbé faria had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he thought that the cardinal spada anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the line marked by the notches in the rock and at the end of it had buried his treasure				11520.07788348588
i know you now				1050.5307591306841
a sob was the only sound he heard				708.2536659452533
your majesty has given me the control of this business we had better wait and see what they want monsieur d artagnan i will answer for everything nothing is so catching as confidence				5065.468510075399
poor assunta had guessed all				208.5214918320474
those who had kept their shares or bought those of danglars looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad night				899.651688079987
he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should return by châteauroux clermont ferrand le puy and nîmes and if i had any money he prayed me to leave it for him at nîmes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings in the smuggling line said monte cristo				359.61005219932366
besides there was no tranquillity in paris itself				3697.965286871529
yes replied aramis and the sloop out there making ready to sail must be that which is to take us to our destination now continued he if only de winter does not keep us waiting				961.4087147423729
for his father s death he was in some manner prepared but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of mercédès				1696.8237904382856
well how much for the equipments if we say one hundred pistoles for the three good for the hundred pistoles there remains then three hundred and fifty porthos made a sign of assent				1620.1933139928328
the monks had no longer an instant of repose				1776.839723381024
by no means said d artagnan				7.26574347657209
he desired kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was and that he would be obedient to her orders				6133.702249470363
at the sight of the stranger m morrel closed the ledger arose and offered a seat to the stranger and when he had seen him seated resumed his own chair				702.1002462545835

oh yes was the ready answer				907.1112178290985
at this moment raoul awoke without a cloud on his face without weariness or lassitude his eyes were fixed on those of athos and perhaps he comprehended all that passed in the heart of the man who was awaiting his awakening as a lover awaits the awakening of his mistress for his glance in return had all the tenderness of love				925.5296189080062
at this sight franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow				454.41762194275367
i have just killed an old friend indeed replied porthos who that poor count de rochefort well				486.12196116672

who informed you this was the master i propose to you				52.31323524428582

chapter vii				3655.6844548294107
d artagnan was secretly touched with remorse not at inducing porthos to enter into schemes in which his life and fortune would be in jeopardy for porthos in the title of baron had his object and reward but poor mousqueton whose only wish was to be called mouston was it not cruel to snatch him from the delightful state of peace and plenty in which he was				1896.7114217324943
doubtless one of the charming females albert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the carriage of the two friends passed her she threw a bunch of violets				923399.2303569296
eh eh eh stammered caderousse				274.3089295795811

milady does not know me i will get access to her without her suspecting me and when i catch my beauty i will strangle her well replied athos i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur porthos for shame said aramis				169.8671936945352
not a word was spoken everyone seemed occupied franz with his disembarkment the sailors with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other				401.09768375059235
so life went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of providence				4100.928837999028
the wise unerring faria could not be mistaken in this one thing				1540.0255864459873
she could not comprehend how a man could conceive such an enterprise and still less how he could have the audacity to disclose it to her whose interest and almost duty it was to punish him				33.991942924068745
her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother				77349.11714277092

however i m glad not to fight them until to morrow				2126.529748683927
the carriage went on and left the two men facing each other no material obstacle separated them				113.06355521439393
before the entrance of the magistrates and indeed frequently afterwards a court of justice on days when some especial trial is to take place resembles a drawing room where many persons recognize each other and converse if they can do so without losing their seats or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by signs				17784.20628943996
the baron entered slowly sending a scrutinizing glance from milady to the young officer				1301.0241234389498
i also i love you				43.04795799639233
my own conscience and your politeness sir are the guarantees of that however flattering this compliment the officer made no reply but drawing from his belt a little silver whistle such as boatswains use in ships of war he whistled three times with three different modulations				1192014.897449494
if you have any preference you can point it out to me and if it be not within a thousand leagues of london attention will be paid to your wishes				8096.440827548076
it is difficult to form an idea of the perfect change that had taken place				573.8526444245953
milady put her charming blond head out at the window and gave her orders to her maid				12319.582056171193
among worldly people manner is contagious				1125379.5824097944
then a low door was opened before him and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room cut out of the rock				2551.8600134762087
the men he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind				4986.754978532187
i have ordered masses for myself and for you gentlemen which will be said gentlemen for which i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited and i said porthos do you think my strain cost me nothing without reckoning mousqueton s wound for which i had to have the surgeon twice a day and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show to an apothecary so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any more ay ay said athos exchanging a smile with d artagnan and aramis it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad that is like a good master in short said porthos when all my expenses are paid i shall have at most thirty crowns left and i about ten pistoles said aramis				134.21271724574888
it seems to me said danglars in his coarse tone ill concealed by a forced smile that you have already got horses enough madame danglars seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young people she pretended not to hear it and said nothing				737.0567919591894

sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her and at others she is merely attended by a black servant and what do you think of her personal appearance oh i consider her perfectly lovely she is just my idea of what medora must have been franz and the countess exchanged a smile and then the latter resumed her conversation with albert while franz returned to his previous survey of the house and company				6228.773122842315

my dear fellow are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her box why i have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing with her three or four times in my life but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask at that instant the countess perceived franz and graciously waved her hand to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head				352.07086408335397

monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers by and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed				6712.287620261488
as they reached the shore the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest tone of voice sir we are at the landing monte cristo remembered that on that very spot on the same rock he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the points of their bayonets				747283.1828457257

the young men then rose and bowing to the count quitted the room				202.23890016938566
lieutenant felton from lord de winter said patrick				136508.6702259795
as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him				34.80472624117566
then replied m de villefort have the kindness to wait half an hour valentine shall come down into the drawing room				192.81931508072742

valentine said he dear valentine you must not speak thus rather let me die				1451.955215106291

well then we ll do our best having said that they went out of the stable well what matters all that to us said d artagnan				68.43079383388286
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all ages which martial thus eulogizes let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars and the many voices of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument as for albert and franz they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to visit these monuments with torches in their hands				525.4868372252583
sire replied tréville without lowering his voice in the least either order my musketeer to be restored to me or let him be tried he shall be tried said the cardinal				277.1874163006234
then that explains everything that is extraordinary said andrea				931.9141492958588
morcerf appreciated the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord				31496.799613879968
deuce take it cried d artagnan more moved than he had been for a long time don t despair my friend if you have not received any letters from the count we have received one oh really cried raoul				672.7729159814528

well decapitator guardian of the state royalist brutus what is the matter said one				676.2816753254452
yes count replied villefort in a voice now scarcely human				1751116.0633823073
but we must say at the present moment d artagnan was ruled by a feeling much more noble and disinterested				896450.8016939835
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life				571.5197418108565
i take as much interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do m danglars in promoting a new railway line you m de villefort in condemning a culprit to death you m debray in pacifying a kingdom you m de château renaud in pleasing a woman and you morrel in breaking a horse that no one can ride				1006407.3888001051
doctor do you hear them call for help yes yes let us hasten up it was in valentine s room but before the doctor and the father could reach the room the servants who were on the same floor had entered and seeing valentine pale and motionless on her bed they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening				1416752.0020827418
i will take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error well then if it be so are you ready albert perfectly let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy yes let us do so the landlord preceded the friends across the landing which was all that separated them from the apartments of the count rang at the bell and upon the door being opened by a servant said i signori francesi the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter				1812.33061216063
no kitty you are mistaken				1763.9759177627639
as soon as i learned i could in any way assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my services the two young men bowed				1362.9058105527038
from twelve to two o clock danglars had remained in his study unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every minute heaping figure upon figure and receiving among other visits one from major cavalcanti who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before to terminate his business with the banker				3935.45758578283
he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her cavalier when their hands touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears				1865.881538901089
well i know of ten such men mazarin made no reply he reflected				2162.630289125284
there disguised under other names and concealed under other costumes are police agents magistrates attorneys general and bailiffs				1224946.615288798
on leaving bazin friquet started off to the palais royal where he arrived at the moment of the turning out of the regiment of guards and as he had only gone there for the enjoyment of seeing it and hearing the music he took his place at their head beating the drum on two pieces of slate and passing from that exercise to that of the trumpet which he counterfeited quite naturally with his mouth in a manner which had more than once called forth the praises of amateurs of imitative harmony				1073294.8993908693
the vision had fled and as if the statues had been but shadows from the tomb they had vanished at his waking				1176636.3733686246
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had maintained his assumed character of father				929.4214554325811
bonacieux and was as we have said close to her he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief which he picked up as was his habit and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and aramis to cut each other s throat				2627.677330885632
thanks to the influence of m morrel to whom next to my father i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed				4347.911713678315
surely said albert as the door of a box on the first circle opened that must be the countess g and who is the countess g inquired château renaud				2020.1838361523528
then adieu valentine valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as morrel was going away and passing both her hands through the opening she clasped and wrung them				105.66236307772327
don t be distressed you have to deal with a cardinal of another kind				7678.1623559005275
by its side on her knees and with her head buried in the cushion of an easy chair was valentine trembling and sobbing her hands extended above her head clasped and stiff				2006644.2043661922
yes that is true said she and i will confess to your majesty that my husband your husband has none				4096.187597913455
the reader must now cross the seine with us and follow us to the door of the carmelite convent in the rue saint jacques				745041.657333332
how many magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against mme				217.7179995718731
one was the notary s the other that of franz and his friends				515.597303991499
oh would we could relate it everywhere and to everyone so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence ah really said monte cristo in a half stifled voice				858.6738923821154
d artagnan went up to him with his usual quickness he caught the anxious glance				2965.3829709311563
knew all and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days which likewise was characteristic				1228411.715836926
that was all				206.7560572406035
a bed of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in one corner				7308.9672351224945
dinner was waiting but as albert had told him that he should not return so soon franz sat down without him				30.925940356691367
she was a perfect linguist a first rate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellow a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer				782692.088509562
but his wound had rendered him too weak to support such an exertion				32052.842366503613
albert at this moment ran in				834.4901551593628
to your eminence murmured bonacieux rolling his eyes round in astonishment				2195.5568400399484
this evening with you to morrow at stuart s the next day with me you see that with a little forethought one can lead a merry life anywhere and everywhere said d artagnan				67.36984058645835
a dead horse said d artagnan pulling up his horse which shied it seems their horses too are breaking down as well as ours i seem to hear the noise of a troop of horsemen exclaimed porthos leaning over his horse s mane				1038125.4656999492
then when de winter rose to take leave listen my lord said the queen i have preserved this diamond cross which came from my mother and this order of st michael which came from my husband				848.5988182862393
it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen they had been ushered into madame de villefort s room who had said she would receive them there				771.9509508812484
swear then said villefort joining the hands of morrel and d avrigny swear that you will spare the honor of my house and leave me to avenge my child d avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble yes but morrel disengaging his hand rushed to the bed and after having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of despair and anguish				6048.382948933296
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no time in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a house of mourning the consequences of a scene so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day				407.7178106287459
it was a gloomy dusty looking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immemorial				1373038.7237764425
the officers table and that of the king were opposite to them				105.07867330239439
my dear planchet said d artagnan sighing we are unfortunately no longer in those times in which princes would care to assassinate me				78.36719217505434
the execution will therefore only be delayed long enough for you to arrange your spiritual and temporal affairs a slight moisture on his brow was the only trace of emotion that charles evinced as he learned these tidings				1533637.03335162
madame de vernet was driven from me putange was exiled madame de chevreuse fell into disgrace and when you wished to come back as ambassador to france the king himself remember my lord the king himself opposed it yes and france is about to pay for her king s refusal with a war				3559.5592354724668
in truth in a few minutes he heard steps approaching and low whispers				756660.3336585027
adieu thereupon he returned in a lively mood to his room and sent to the swiss the things that belonged to him				35.51375417586047
the suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of d artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket but what probability was there that mme				228.2677093556822
are there not crimes for which the impalement of the turks the augers of the persians the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society				5447.431822637108
it is my will morrel				215.12990314712067
the past like the country through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance				3476.346163540977
ah really this is magnificent				5448.548878454964
franz could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and albert to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex				20305.630440214376
there was no longer a doubt that felton was convinced felton was hers				93779.70677155176
they withdrew to a private house and as they had reason every moment to fear for their safety they occupied but one room and provided an exit which might be useful in case of an attack				7705.1710684157415
then he placed her in the boat and as he was going to set foot in it himself athos handed him a sum of silver				2715.303808972573
most assuredly responded madame de villefort in the same tone				521.5924220553395
there was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither mme				161.4191506528769
we were about a third of the way across the river when the cord of the ferryboat broke				29375.69348570792
like all popular movements the shock given by the rush of this mob was formidable				91996.19414465493
should i ever get out of prison and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured i see answered dantès				610.4384184328634
the abbé took the note				5219.24578504701
he found edmond lying prone bleeding and almost senseless				1828855.4595559016
the following sunday then the parisians arose with joy at that period a te deum was a grand affair this kind of ceremony had not then been abused and it produced a great effect				2117.6776786534015

this time however due precautions were taken to prevent any attempt at escape				4214.606753694362
la carconte double locked the door behind the jeweller chapter				275.604289323118
really my dear count said morcerf what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as much but it is your manner of being served without any questions in a moment in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of ringing and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire in constant readiness what you say is perhaps true they know my habits				41896.345087098474
madame said he if i dared in my turn advise would it be to give up broussel sir				725.1071569073144
as for myself i can assure you of one thing the more men you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my opinion death may be a torture but it is not an expiation i do not quite understand you replied franz pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch listen said the count and deep hatred mounted to his face as the blood would to the face of any other				397.04923374758937
what a noise about a musketeer				997.9379967241787
the streets were crowded for it was the day of pentecost and the crowd looked in wonder at these two cavaliers one as fresh as if he had come out of a bandbox the other so covered with dust that he looked as if he had but just come off a field of battle				1259.7805975250699
do but make no treaty you understand me you need not fear morrel advanced towards beauchamp and château renaud who seeing his intention came to meet him				33.229728435013605
but his son came in				821.417834623333
see john see how well she knows how to handle a knife in fact milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand but these last words this supreme insult relaxed her hands her strength and even her will				740.4540395952037
that order does not concern me replied milady coldly since it bears another name than mine a name				746.4465550562109
that is all i require				63226.550767730834
contrary to custom this gentleman had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank and one who would allow no impertinent interference his incognito was strictly respected				177862.6765895956
