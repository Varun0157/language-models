debray will perhaps be obliged to go to the minister and besides albert looked at his tablets it is the hour i told the count may at half past ten and though i do not much rely upon his promise i wish to be punctual				159782.88397094002

descending into the grotto he lifted the stone filled his pockets with gems put the box together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance then quitting the grotto he replaced the stone heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with earth into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it				94.41256603567382
but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders				853.2365197408071

i am condemned leave me to my death my king said aramis they well may raise a scaffold but they can not make an executioner what do you mean asked the king				461.1402737368155
but if you think the king s life is not worth what it must cost there s an end of the matter and i send to groslow to say i am ill no you are right said athos				187.5225521884701
i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so much and which feared nothing and i went to the king s attorney and this king s attorney was named villefort asked monte cristo carelessly				12974.649783920502

describe him in order that if we meet him by chance like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him you could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these points for i knew him when he was a child and one day that i fell into his hands going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me let us see the watch said albert				328.7133330377615

with his white aristocratic hands he played with the louis bending and straightening them again as if they were made of pewter				601625.3648298933
she for a moment contemplated with fright that stupid countenance impressed with the invincible resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear				1245.756963198222
d artagnan and athos refused them				68.86875073367784
the jailer stared				52659.054355561035
my father who never goes out has several times been on the point of refusing this invitation madame de villefort on the contrary is burning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own house therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father to accompany her				207.73865487834888

on seeing the queen the men stopped short respectfully				11241.545312205662
as to aramis he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir an eating room and a bedroom which room situated as the others were on the ground floor looked out upon a little fresh green garden shady and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors				47864.01422077304
lord how i have eaten m coquenard had eaten his soup the black feet of the fowl and the only mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat				38777.39550676828

her mouth was small and rosy and although her underlip like that of all princes of the house of austria protruded slightly beyond the other it was eminently lovely in its smile but as profoundly disdainful in its contempt				6290.792807869664
take one step more said i and in addition to my dishonor you shall have my death to reproach yourself with there was no doubt in my look my voice my whole person that sincerity of gesture of attitude of accent which carries conviction to the most perverse minds for he paused				2727.41861338752
it was then that the door of edward s room opened and a head we have before noticed appeared in the glass opposite it was madame de villefort who came to witness the effects of the drink she had prepared				27004.510684457386
because he left no commentaries replied la ramee with his coarse laugh				2338.3653448161767

a secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be something more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship				10583.381350372927
no replied athos with a singular smile				537.2926362042047
the friendship which united these four men and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day whether for dueling business or pleasure caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows and the inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another from the luxembourg to the place st sulpice or from the rue du vieux colombier to the luxembourg				4003.2652044233982
the manuscript was the great work by the abbé faria upon the kingdoms of italy				3813.212407352666

coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same moment her guest entered from the stairs and the appearance of the worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment				23652.09672666174
if my mother could know of this attention on your part and i will venture to tell her i am sure that she will be most grateful to you it is true that my father will be equally angry the count laughed				3566.004734494144
the shops were deserted houses closed every one wished to see the young king with his mother and the famous cardinal mazarin whom they hated so much that no one wished to be deprived of his presence				2648.584497516192
it was necessary to be as good a horseman as he was to risk such a scheme for no sooner had the animal felt the burning tinder than he uttered a cry of pain and reared and jumped as if he had been mad				3865.770543370864
the rest concerns myself don t be uneasy about that be prudent athos said aramis				107.5626432999913
divan walls ceiling floor were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets there were heavy maned lion skins from atlas striped tiger skins from bengal panther skins from the cape spotted beautifully like those that appeared to dante bear skins from siberia fox skins from norway and so on and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious bed				762.7646568304071

athos bowed				1471.389510632095
and as i am a connoisseur in such things having had a few of my own once i estimated it at a thousand pistoles i hope said d artagnan half dead with fright you made no mention of my diamond on the contrary my dear friend this diamond became our only resource with it i might regain our horses and their harnesses and even money to pay our expenses on the road athos you make me tremble cried d artagnan				75.69099542500678

this is torture to me cried athos				7.64437526227453
d artagnan took possession of his command				4536.220229708111
at the sight of papers of all sorts titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the family all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in spite of the most exhaustive researches i found nothing				786.9623958984405

and when did you arrive here inquired she				312.51359734577187
at eight o clock the march was resumed in the same order as the night before except that d artagnan left his friends and began to renew the acquaintance which he had already struck up with monsieur groslow				2715.5912604077275
it led into the park as the three fugitives perceived by the night breeze which rushed into the corridor and blew the wind into their faces				7690.121925299386
there are no tears in my eyes nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you maximilian whom i love as my own son				895.4924332062615
everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands				166244.91077858393

i can not comprehend what induced you to buy three therefore i only purchased two said aramis				89.1604032069122
this disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess who are still as much united although married more than twenty years as on the first day of their wedding monte cristo glanced rapidly at albert as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart				394.7781400961434
on entering the courtyard of the old chateau the first person seen by our ambassador was maitre bernouin in person who standing on the threshold awaited news of his vanished master				1357.5871655564026
his vengeance therefore consisted in coining curses on the head of mazarin he even tried to make some verses on him but soon gave up the attempt for monsieur de beaufort had not only not received from heaven the gift of versifying he had the greatest difficulty in expressing himself in prose				223793.6135337794

the duke went indoors and retired to bed where he spent indeed the greater part of every day as they had taken his books away				1044.6906554755408
so blind were his contemporaries that they regarded the cardinal s death as a deliverance and i even i opposed the designs of the great man who held the destinies of france within the hollow of his hand				191.90810905345552

milady had sunk into a chair with her hands extended as if to conjure this terrible apparition				5070.485370688778
i can not now repeat to you sir all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of it was more than piety it was more than grief and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any children for if i were a father and felt such excessive grief as the old man does and did not find in my memory or heart all he is now saying i should throw myself into the sea at once for i could not bear it poor father murmured the priest				3613.046201197058

dantès gazed on the man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently nourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration				2869.688841249291
but dantès can not remain forever in prison and one day or other he will leave it and the day when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration oh i should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me yes and mercédès				1677.9030719217988

then infusing all the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice he addressed the inspector and sought to inspire him with pity				2246.7957312177305
perhaps it was a mere whim on his part for he is falling they say into second childhood but i love him for showing so much interest in you how singular murmured maximilian your father hates me while your grandfather on the contrary what strange feelings are aroused by politics hush cried valentine suddenly someone is coming maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it				90.04718277477892

pray continue well then listen				1896.1851208793296
i will complain to monsieur de tréville and monsieur de tréville will complain to the king he then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave them to the host who accompanied him cap in hand to the gate and remounted his yellow horse which bore him without any further accident to the gate of st antoine at paris where his owner sold him for three crowns which was a very good price considering that d artagnan had ridden him hard during the last stage				14505.027538309228
i know all that for it is with the justice of all countries especially that i have occupied myself it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural justice and i must say sir that it is the law of primitive nations that is the law of retaliation that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god if this law were adopted sir said the procureur it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that case the magistrates would not as you just observed have much to do it may perhaps come to this in time observed monte cristo you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection in the meanwhile continued the magistrate our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs roman laws and frank usages the knowledge of all which you will agree is not to be acquired without extended labor it needs tedious study to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong power of brain to retain it i agree with you entirely sir but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations				78306.20085930939
barrois said she				140.78745192268744
and she resumed her seat as if plunged in reflections entirely personal				1164117.6589818515
his heart failed him				31.783405713613227
did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter yes d avrigny reflected a moment then approaching noirtier pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation				1619.1692121236008
the queen at that time liked me and called me the most honest man in the kingdom				6452.731177549936
yesterday i undertook to employ that cord which you see hanging against the wall but pain prevented my continuing the pious exercise that s the first time i ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot wounds with cat o nine tails but you were ill and illness renders the head weak therefore you may be excused when do you mean to set out tomorrow at daybreak				86641.27793165077
what is that news asked d artagnan				7.194479867215682
about what time why about fifteen or eighteen days ago exactly so and yesterday evening he came again yesterday evening yes just before you came my dear athos we are enveloped in a network of spies				150474.9199459319
then resumed he mad desperate determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything honor and happiness my poor brother returned to lille and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place surrendered himself and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison				1225.3478402226915
i have fought too long they have sold me they shall give me up and the eternal shame of treble treason shall fall on their heads sire said athos perhaps a king should act thus but not a husband and a father				926.2055371051482
but don t sleep as you do all the time nothing dulls the intellect like sleep				870.1356345312968
there to his great astonishment d artagnan heard the policy which made all europe tremble criticized aloud and openly as well as the private life of the cardinal which so many great nobles had been punished for trying to pry into				29317.73200048028
this child was the only heir to lord de winter if lord de winter did not marry				16351.984882223478
he would no longer be alone				1005.0007516671513
old dantès who was only sustained by hope lost all hope at napoleon s downfall				991516.2572948915
you should have allowed me to sleep				818.0102339060754
it was as we have said the of march and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness				1033.0786020615021
i advise you to complain said porthos				10.827367738313413
as to lord de winter he descended the stairs rapidly and went straight to the port				5534.836632812209
to the questions which d artagnan put concerning her health she replied bad very bad then replied he my visit is ill timed you no doubt stand in need of repose and i will withdraw no no said milady				321.8473663018248
ah my dear sir you are most welcome i was expecting you indeed said the italian was your excellency then aware of my visit yes i had been told that i should see you today at seven o clock then you have received full information concerning my arrival of course ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my coming oh no it has not but you are sure you are not mistaken very sure it really was i whom your excellency expected at seven o clock this evening i will prove it to you beyond a doubt oh no never mind that said the italian it is not worth the trouble yes yes said monte cristo				291.13598338107346
yes sdeath				9189211.820147742
that makes no difference said aramis coloring and who affirmed as i said that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable without informing me whence it came it is only to poets that such things happen said athos gravely				2709.154210175981
as soon as the escort arrived in a city when they had conducted the king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to some secluded cabaret where they neither drank nor played they only conversed in a low voice looking around attentively to see that no one overheard them				106.50784161970705
and did you go alone asked morrel after he had read it				69.15461634460566
in that case i should beat a retreat				1476.6342735937124
nogent beautin the fool of the court exclaimed that the queen was very happy to have the succor of religion at such a moment this caused a universal burst of laughter				1211.5919527779993
now continued aramis taking the same graceful position in his easy chair that he would have assumed in bed and complacently examining his hand which was as white and plump as that of a woman and which he held in the air to cause the blood to descend now as you have heard d artagnan monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be dogmatic while i for my part would rather it should be ideal				660218.9020735867
unfortunately we do not live in the times of the great emperor we live in the times of the cardinal and three days hence however well the secret might be guarded it would be known i say that we were to fight and our combat would be prevented				546187.8017890643
motionless against the dark tapestry with her hair in disorder she appeared like a horrid image of terror				1164.1963734004435
that would give me an idea of how i looked when i arrived in paris				499.4472216965641
will you assure me it shall not be signed yes said noirtier				1650.1450137678269
i shall have nothing to do but to fold my arms				474.6386545309081
i only speak that exact truth and you say that one of your friends lives in that house i say so and i repeat it for the third time that house is one inhabited by my friend and that friend is aramis all this will be cleared up at a later period murmured the young woman no monsieur be silent if you could see my heart said d artagnan you would there read so much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would instantly satisfy my curiosity				3713.10437945455
now you are rich said monte cristo				181.46333447486657
we learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these victories				1051113.1043538412
but what can i do with you				67.77013922926821
for you monsieur said planchet presenting the billet to the young man				139.74286805656425
i am in possession of all my senses sir he said my body alone suffers as you may suppose				194576.60835686108
his eye elate with happiness was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of haydée when suddenly the door opened				1195.8627756311075
but i do not see the count of monte cristo here he is worn out said debray besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti who it appears presented themselves to him with false letters of credit and cheated him out of francs upon the hypothesis of this principality by the way m de château renaud asked beauchamp how is morrel ma foi i have called three times without once seeing him				27.752438956483715
one of them stationed upon the top stair naked sword in hand prevented or at least endeavored to prevent the three others from ascending				1494656.8797057078
there is nothing to do but to send monsieur mazarin to the most distant frontier and to take care that he does not return even by that nor any other entrance into france one instant sir said the man in a gown whom he addressed a plague on t				57915.01898338401
as my grandfather used to say i once reigned in paris				477.7758882008593
advance gentlemen said the cardinal				235.466317729226
then you know what i have suffered said mme				40.364082785703374
we request you then if you really have business here to wait till we have finished our repast or to come again a short time hence unless which would be far better you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels and come and drink with us to the health of the king of france take care athos cried d artagnan don t you see they are aiming yes yes said athos but they are only civilians very bad marksmen who will be sure not to hit me in fact at the same instant four shots were fired and the balls were flattened against the wall around athos but not one touched him				30.991388730550433
you may go the footman went out				416.2985153476675
five days after your departure he came back and in a very bad condition too				3640.7482261982536
tomorrow i will see you again to take my leave with these words the baron went out				509.81814749542525
now you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast				4022.1581802573864
andrea drove past the last house in the village without saying a word to his companion who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle				1038779.0935551801
they saw him in the distance climbing the rock in order to look down upon the boat as it passed				2262.789878097816
m de villefort who examined him attentively and who no doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze				9978.37628504531
now on taking prisoners this morning two frenchmen who seemed to me of high birth in short two knights of the garter i said to myself my fortune is made				1209.3824116255723
each of them had a ticket attached to it by which it might be recognized and from that moment the sieur de la coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues				752897.8765615303
but when they were alone he said you have done that which you ought to have done d artagnan but perhaps you have been wrong d artagnan sighed deeply for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul which told him that great misfortunes awaited him				24.231698896776052
if she had not yet taken any repose he at least was already up				1291.7516741459085
ah cried porthos would i were but a baron well my friend i am come to give you this very title which you wish for so much porthos gave a start that shook the room two or three bottles fell and were broken				139363.513495467
caderousse lingered for a moment then taking leave of old dantès he went downstairs to rejoin danglars who awaited him at the corner of the rue senac				1334559.2846390847
he had made his valet cover him with honey then opening a feather bed he had rolled in it and had thus become the most grotesque fowl it is possible to imagine				89889.96163198353
while the count smiled at hearing this song which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husband s strength of mind who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand francs by a failure at milan				463708.4881283032
a war of partisans unworthy of a king the example of robert bruce will absolve you sire no no				1031.7007056514233
and whose horses are these cried d artagnan				7.2710037407604045
a nice acquaintance my friend porthos replied aramis i have had the occasion to observe to you more than once that you are very indiscreet and that is injurious to you among the women gentlemen gentlemen cried d artagnan who began to get a glimpse of the result of the adventure the thing is serious				115195.45423634547
but mercédès did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little window of the room which had been occupied by old dantès				652.075735025759
above you there is the king above the king there is god however perfect master he was over himself my persecutor allowed a movement of anger to escape him				38.26481376090835
why this very morning in my rooms he made his entrée amongst us by striking every man of us with amazement not even excepting château renaud and what do you suppose is the count s age inquired mercédès evidently attaching great importance to this question				603.6273048811165
our swords cried d artagnan raising his head and regaining his self possession				2357.0526403927465
when you have arrived there you will go to a mean tavern without a name and without a sign a mere fisherman s hut				899664.2151007433
a poet is as good as an abbé				446.6248152064062
in the first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half drunk and yet in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain d artagnan when awaking on the following morning had all the words of athos as present to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth they had been so impressed upon his mind				694.1250489810586
jesus seigneur				2267708.0386129282
and now go mordaunt before i go said mordaunt i have some questions and a favor to ask you sir a favor from me mordaunt bowed				1310.0407596768048
no monsieur returned the count and he drew from his pocket a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea				1012223.1484400629
his three companions joined him				34.72913812698492
are there then in england two men to whom such an epithet can be applied you mean george villiers asked felton whose looks became excited				100070.851393462
while he turned this over in his mind planchet did his best to make up for lost time at table				673.0732547253469
i took one of them by the throat and three quarters throttled him				35.316974699504776
after the king and the cardinal m de tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most frequently repeated by the military and even by citizens				1138524.6726590418
i replied the gascon i believe in devotion as a word at one s baptism for instance which naturally comes before one s proper name every one is naturally more or less devout certainly but there should be at the end of one s devotion something to gain and your friend for instance what does he expect to have at the end of his devotion well my lord my friend has three magnificent estates that of vallon at corbeil that of bracieux in the soissonais and that of pierrefonds in the valois				1315185.1727764641
he is a coward with women perhaps but not with men				1179.3718166667245
could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the camp				2427.1932174775166
you are brave monsieur d artagnan continued his eminence you are prudent which is still better				761.4346225871259
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required namely a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled one				806.7664103703303
therefore if you part with m baptistin give me the refusal of him by all means that is not all give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of the cavalcanti and if by any chance he should be wishing to establish his son find him a wife very rich very noble on her mother s side at least and a baroness in right of her father i will help you in the search ah ha you will do as much as that will you yes well really nothing is certain in this world oh count what a service you might render me				81.57132686170964
ten minutes after she pitched forward then the other way spun round and round and then good bye to the pharaon				4301.734555512398
well said he filling the glasses let us drink to captain edmond dantès husband of the beautiful catalane caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand and swallowed the contents at a gulp				651527.8513390146
the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in fact he did not notice the offered hand				198.27032289867384
he hoped to meet with m de monte cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs				1126.9878077730293
the jailer advanced dantès appeared not to perceive him				27.271869536572883
in fifteen days at most rochefort would be back besides during that fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge herself on the four friends				505.2531088095874
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence				2310.9473473852368
ah ah said lord de winter after having played comedy after having played tragedy we are now playing melancholy the prisoner made no reply				1097.4021135918933
these can not be for us said athos				8.164064734253293
you notice my ring said the gascon proud to display so rich a gift in the eyes of his friends				521.2274367108917
don t deny it you were recognized and the cardinal named you				64.87599782941294
villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return he could read no other expression on their features				5270.137967499431
aramis you think that d artagnan that porthos would lend their hands to such an infamy among friends my dear athos no you are right but among enemies it would be only a stratagem athos crossed his arms and bowed his noble head				374.31206059328855
it was you who were behind my bed curtains that night the parisians wished to see me asleep and if the king permits me returned the gascon i shall be near him always when there is danger to be encountered sir said mazarin to porthos what would you do if the crowd fell upon us kill as many as i could my lord hem				2042120.0246263545
we have heard all it was necessary we should hear besides i don t prevent you from listening but i must be gone you must be gone said porthos and if the cardinal asks for you what answer can we make you will not wait till he asks you will speak first and tell him that i am gone on the lookout because certain expressions of our host have given me reason to think the road is not safe				18091.79995032523
we mount them and before daylight are twenty leagues distant athos placed his two hands on d artagnan s shoulders and gazed at him with his calm sad smile				551.7437120416708
i neither approve nor disapprove my lord i merely await your commands good it is you accordingly that i have pitched upon to conduct the king and the queen to saint germain liar thought d artagnan				64.7994472587481
as for m de tréville when the eyes of the king fell upon him he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes after which his majesty grumbling entered his apartment				629.2385640417267
in crossing the gallery parallel to the large glass gallery he perceived de winter who was waiting until the queen had finished her negotiation				859353.5171644029
in which it is proved that first impulses are oftentimes the best				3425.157257307326
will finish by shouting out down with all the people i have mentioned each in his turn				1169.907099672694
if i believed that i would place my arm under yours and go with you to marseilles leaving the house to return to it no more fernand s eye darted lightning				2407.7293857796744
thanks replied the jeweller				6841.777993995302
oh do not deny it				63.82793021332427
the duchess could not restrain a cry of joy on seeing so handsome a young cavalier so far surpassing all that her maternal pride had been able to conceive				784591.8238430236
yes if i am killed said albert laughing				1495.684101292678
her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels				7519.2410639360505
what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude that is right cried the marquise				3159.6305112498126
i can t see				805.5762696388284
he opened a window and leaned out to listen				1677.7966637871716
you have not forgotten st gervais athos and the napkin which was converted into a banner and he then related to raoul the story of the bastion and raoul fancied he was listening to one of those deeds of arms belonging to days of chivalry so gloriously recounted by tasso and ariosto				527954.0266823792
as to porthos except his real name as was the case with those of his two comrades his life was very easily known				6047.811925330017
for peppino cried andrea who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged				1734510.385593167
they sat down in such a manner as to turn their backs on nobody				713187.0506932115
danglars felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the man appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said monsieur deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee today he got up and knocked on the door the bandit raised his head				388.2149944832845
and a large sum said mazarin				250.8278687484316
a terrible howling interrupted these reflections of d artagnan and mme				172.54344688176442
they passed the barrier without accident				2666.9771649360828
as you please he said death is always death that is forgetfulness repose exclusion from life and therefore from grief he sat down and monte cristo placed himself opposite to him				36.78357003607193
it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a dream for the man to disappear or assume some other form				1521.8449800165454
adieu adieu said aramis				28.59813710276116
the palais de justice communicated with the prison a sombre edifice that from its grated windows looks on the clock tower of the accoules				835729.0703784378
and they continued their way crossing the barricades getting the chains about their legs pushed about questioning and questioned				11374.740481798815
in the meantime please to sit down monsieur and i will fetch you some refreshment the jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince				1288.0661382820876
the prisoner thought this a good opportunity for escape he called out his name and cried for help				4123.620144910149
that comforts me a little has he wit or not this demon d artagnan said porthos astonished at his friend s deception				490895.5917702712
now then let us breakfast with what an air he says all this muttered beauchamp decidedly he is a great man a great man in his own country added debray				399.0512943200935
come but where is the doctor exclaimed villefort where is he madame de villefort now deliberately descended the staircase				3186.702440330224
and to that friend i say during the three quarters of an hour that the struggle continued i watched the convulsions and the death of madame de saint méran and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison but i could also specify the poison can it be possible the symptoms are marked do you see sleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve centres				1397748.741988404
change these lackeys said he she has spoken to them				87.96799514507944
he stopped one moment at the door for baptistin whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running				1184672.316906378
one would have said that he longed to break through the wall of glass which separated him from his enemy for if comminges had seen with what an expression of hatred the eyes of this young man were fixed upon de winter he would not have doubted for an instant that the englishman was his eternal foe				25053.024742123784
you positively recognize m de morcerf as the officer fernand mondego indeed i do cried haydée				5737.2625766364035
police affairs cried the king taking up tréville s words police affairs				1876.7901501591978
d artagnan told me that he had recommended him to your care in parting yes count nor have i lost sight of him for a single instant since then said athos in a tone of delight he is well				488.74488640731977
place this man in the care of his guards again and let him wait till i send for him no monseigneur no it is not he cried bonacieux no i was deceived				3849.575768464222
at any rate tell me there s more chance of fighting in paris is there not in that respect my dear friend it s delightful				4295.736850707564
oh my friends said d artagnan you come once more to save my life not only mine but that of these gentlemen				1172.2407007705656
he took a pencil tore a page from his tablets and wrote my dear marshal in an hour lens will be in the enemy s possession				2229.3397298005893
in the meantime d artagnan who had plunged into a bypath continued his route and reached st				2199.0227944430303
then she suddenly cried oh no no rising and retreating to the very wall				1097.4915984801028
there is but one person or rather one cause to whom a man like me can be useful that of the king exactly answered the musketeer				976.1427325174709
then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the windows				1430.517996540205

though all bowed before her as etiquette required she had now but a single arm on which she could lean				1031067.8549846924
but cried felton that is a fleur de lis which i see there and therein consisted the infamy replied milady				568.6090152144146
the prisoners transported the previous evening from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the night each accompanied by two priests in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals				2064387.7231003675

not because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator why so much the better that is all i hope it may be so replied caderousse his face flushed with cupidity				37956.792724883315
he continued to follow the path to the glade but to his great surprise carlini arrived almost as soon as himself				184.83337902367916
milady smiled with joy				1107.6494767258491
my heart told me what your mouth has just confirmed that is to say with what view you have exposed yourself to the dangers of a sea so perilous or at least so troublesome at this moment and i sent my cutter to meet you				59.847618697725544
monte cristo seemed in despair				1046.03851459416
calmed by appearances he ventured to walk on through the rue notre dame				2278.5860306758586
danglars threw himself upon his goat skin and peppino reclosing the door again began eating his peas and bacon				1500076.1337132836
it is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are answered the wounded man				124.68438656926271
and what does it concern then my captivity i heard of it the day it happened but as you were not guilty of any crime as you were not guilty of any intrigue as you in short knew nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else i attached no more importance to that event than it merited you speak very much at your ease madame said bonacieux hurt at the little interest his wife showed in him				33.54715594922929

we will talk over our travels and you who have seen the whole world will relate your adventures you shall tell us the history of the beautiful greek who was with you the other night at the opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess				5647.038072475402
mazarin replied d artagnan bursting into a laugh				2264.5417441657487
the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister and became enamoured of her amorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her				202.7621573079504
besides i have promised him your patronage you are right said the duke				543.3891953054963
then seeing that the room was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his wife hello carconte said he the worthy priest has not deceived us the diamond is real an exclamation of joy was heard and the staircase creaked beneath a feeble step				1498.416715510537
well said aramis				29.183649072694337
yes yes replied he i perceive that plainly but do you really believe it is she i am sure of it nevertheless i confess i still doubt but the fleur de lis on her shoulder she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france and has been branded in consequence athos she is your wife i tell you repeated d artagnan only reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other yes but i should think the other must be dead i hanged her so effectually it was d artagnan who now shook his head in his turn				1147.422935211949
there is nothing more easy said mousqueton with a modest air				1545.3897245198189
that s right said athos put your other hand here and he offered him his shoulder as another stay and support so that his head almost touched that of mordaunt and these two mortal enemies were in as close an embrace as if they had been brothers				25022.24632631087
come in gentlemen repeated the princess opening the door herself				1829.4387894445506
thrown over the foot of the royal bed my simar madame looks not unlike the mantle worn by kings this was one of the humiliations which mazarin made anne undergo more frequently than any other and one that bowed her head with shame				3845.3194829964204
when this crisis was past when milady appeared to have resumed her self possession which she had never lost when felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently he said ah now				1393.802519209992
d avrigny m d avrigny cried she in a stifled voice				736.0916231813492
his sight was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him				33.82616957678722

donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations				139146.11381851736
these were all who were left of the little troop				86289.17564418563
i see said he there are two of them one does the work while the other stands guard he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man in the street and turned to the one in the dressing room				204.73194264660523
he was well known at the hôtel of the musketeers where everyone considered him a good comrade				8012.232445684432
my misgivings had been but too true				1087.6083737800664
still i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers it would have produced such an effect				2102.89673665943
sir she said to morcerf you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer				382904.9951380585
if your friends are the more speedy you are to be saved if the satellites of the cardinal you are lost oh yes yes lost beyond redemption				1483018.295988928
mordaunt darted to the steps understood all uttered a cry as if his very heart was pierced and fell fainting on the stone steps				1714.0973971138017
no there is nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness				43164.48636271108
at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his fallen enemy and forced him to ask for mercy				114645.49901025604
as he had foreseen lens had fallen into the hands of the enemy immediately after raoul s departure				4924.527660838413
after walking for about ten minutes during which danglars did not exchange a single word with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three men standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre				221594.67285244723
danglars thought dentro la testa meant put in your head he was making rapid progress in italian				7787.659755109423
de saint méran had always expressed a desire in case his death happened during his absence from paris that his body might be brought to the family vault				1131387.4925729732
he took the arm of château renaud and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins				22341.861090793765
then he let his head sink upon his two hands while d artagnan stood before him stupefied				3141.183166735491
on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied d artagnan without his sword and the three musketeers armed				11046.941340696752
of whom do you speak				1691.4267370465925
yes that first and other things afterward speak it is a thing of the highest interest and upon which our future fortune perhaps depends the complexion of our fortune has changed very much since i saw you madame bonacieux and i should not be astonished if in the course of a few months it were to excite the envy of many folks yes particularly if you follow the instructions i am about to give you me yes you				64.70453397467669
i want to know what crime i have committed to be tried and if i am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at liberty are you well fed said the inspector				3471.873385651848
nevertheless he pressed d artagnan s hand and said to him you are an honest youth but at the present moment i can only do for you that which i just now offered				1706388.5827030658
well said the baroness do you leave m cavalcanti with your daughter and mademoiselle d armilly said the banker do you consider her no one then turning to monte cristo he said prince cavalcanti is a charming young man is he not				413.52946729175164
i know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastret s warehouse and at smyrna from pascal s that is all i was obliged to know and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars now i recollect said the afflicted old father my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee and another of tobacco for me there you see exclaimed danglars				623.1595167718976

well m morrel said danglars you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us yes yes poor captain leclere				24652.761351170066
juxon consented the more readily to take him with him as he would require an assistant priest in case the king should wish to communicate				828560.5697880696
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest sound he rose and hastened to the door convinced they were about to liberate him but the sound died away and dantès sank again into his seat				1046.6452191508488

i know you even better now his mocking laugh and threatening words passed over their heads carried by the breeze until lost in the depths of the horizon				3555.8304582748215

the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris				539.223241078754
through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch				42909.60804964656
the thin spare man yes the executioner in short asked aramis				122.9162722711592

besides she had a thousand precautions to take a thousand counsels to give to her defender in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses				6334.801406159389

he was not the less intoxicated with joy electrified by love				908.8339455182067
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks				1068403.1624653693
planchet whom he had sent home two hours before from the hôtel de ville telling him to sit up for him opened the door for him				31.566756851421285
no not that way i beg sir quickly exclaimed the cardinal be so good as to pass by yonder gallery by which you can regain the hall				5454.980297840334

they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to teresa and luigi who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st sebastian well said the count turning towards franz it seems to me that this is a very likely story				2929.3891250241118
aramis stipulated that bazin should officiate at that ceremony and that planchet should furnish the christening sugar plums				1208532.2258673415
it seemed to explain to him the change in athos a resemblance between the boy and the man explained the mystery of this regenerated existence				2163.641123320193
why he is surrounded by sultanas like a turk				1337182.4203979988

do you know that i was plunged during a day and night in a dungeon of the bastille oh a day and night soon pass away				1031.312627557727
he clapped his hands three times the ordinary signal of lovers but nobody replied to him not even an echo				425435.5877728856
to enter the room he must again see the body of his unfortunate wife				1285.220636573754
adieu gentlemen and remounting his horse which cahusac led to him he saluted them with his hand and rode away				1038.0644808417353
d artagnan turned toward her saying then send him away madame pooh said the swiss who had needed a little time to take in d artagnan s proposal pooh				46954.71634980834
by the bye he said i think that we are decidedly wrong to depart thus without leaving a line for porthos and d artagnan the thing is done dear friend said athos i foresaw that and have embraced them both from you and myself you are a wonderful man my dear count said aramis you think of everything well have you made up your mind to this journey quite and now that i reflect about it i am glad to leave paris at this moment and so am i replied athos my only regret is not having seen d artagnan but the rascal is so cunning he might have guessed our project when supper was over blaisois entered				760.4165004828973
danglars was one of those men born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in place of a heart				400.2915761943978
no madame on the honor of a soldier on the faith of a christian what you are ignorant of lord de winter s designs upon me i am impossible you are his confidant i never lie madame oh he conceals them too little for you not to divine them i seek to divine nothing madame i wait till i am confided in and apart from that which lord de winter has said to me before you he has confided nothing to me why then cried milady with an incredible tone of truthfulness you are not his accomplice you do not know that he destines me to a disgrace which all the punishments of the world can not equal in horror you are deceived madame said felton blushing lord de winter is not capable of such a crime good said milady to herself without thinking what it is he calls it a crime then aloud the friend of that wretch is capable of everything whom do you call that wretch asked felton				1009.6638206153299
the count left his box and a moment later was saluting the baronne danglars who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise				2009.0442502171225
the host armed himself with a spit and rushed into the chamber occupied by the two friends				525.4785684258615
a moment s silence ensued and then in a full sonorous voice the king exclaimed remember he had scarcely uttered the word when a heavy blow shook the scaffold and where athos stood immovable a warm drop fell upon his brow				430.7463203242375
oh said morrel i know not indeed if i may reveal this secret to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me count morrel hesitated				3463.7410861474486
placed between life and death as bernajoux was he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed				2299.745758204105
what more is to be done i will do whatever is necessary this assurance delighted morrel who took leave of villefort and hastened to announce to old dantès that he would soon see his son				883.4489457448349
dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore and instead of landing at the usual place he dropped anchor in the little creek				807455.0029638822
he beat a retreat toward the market but there he met planchet with his halberdiers their halberds were leveled at him threateningly				64553.688278331836
him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity oh said andrea my father s old servant				1539.6239540680979
poverty overtook you				50.55627741524758

yes what do you hope the old man made him understand with his eyes that he could not answer				854.6600706081592
yes indeed i have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen families will be forever lost to those men who persecute me				96.4868747592242
but as we have said he waited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of his triumph				26801.285698159314
yes this self of whom i thought so much of whom i was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the château d if and whom i had succeeded in making so great will be but a lump of clay tomorrow				2150.3165897505937
as for you my dear lieutenant i promise you nothing but if you bring him back to me dead or alive you may ask all you wish to horse porthos said d artagnan taking his friend by the hand				172.71532289545897

i demand then that the examination shall take place as soon as possible and i will furnish the house with all necessary information what day do you fix asked the president				1244.4567313849004
behind him blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast stone structure whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures				32590.467976009684
ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta it is charming let them finish one moment				528.0295058619638
we are not such devils as we appear to be				784.0565618970425
marie michon oh what do i not owe you aramis said d artagnan				21.437284325899775
more than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service				1990.351379838472
the count of monte cristo had just entered				673.4552892474828
under the other cardinal continued d artagnan we didn t know enough to make our profits this however doesn t concern you with your forty thousand francs income the happiest man in the world it seems to me porthos sighed				5236.08675927781
until this day and for how long a time he had refrained from talking of the treasure which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness				22658.401294660067
from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six hours all the horses stationed on the road were ready				1038.4140009991522
monte cristo bowed and went to madame de villefort				261.6463318394172
the carriage stopped				1409.2662409738575
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes				2097.5379182132947
albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up				1326.0868408710385
ordinarily prisoners were interrogated in their cells but they did not do so with m bonacieux				2709.2071755349075
then dantès rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated				135449.83900724698
my friends that s exactly like me				62.205568824149815
i tell you sir that two persons exist in you the father has mourned sufficiently now let the procureur fulfil his office the eyes of noirtier glistened and d avrigny approached				2285.44354332423
without doubt she murmured				6477.671388616565
the foundation s business office is located at north west salt lake city ut				15139.651061186174
old woman screamed nanette				124759.98766331254
the same day the will was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old man sealed in the presence of all and given in charge to m deschamps the family notary				1574.117686610972
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes				3994.6691002872944
i do not see here she said anything but general conditions the interests of the prince de conti or of the ducs de beaufort de bouillon and d elbeuf and of the coadjutor are herein consulted but with regard to yours we do ourselves justice madame even in assuming the high position that we have				4120.8093010488265
against calumniators said m de tréville				1088.963832484973
he was immediately recognized as one of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the iron heeled shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged				5067.956986841034
oh father father murmured she courage the pharaon has gone down then said morrel in a hoarse voice				799.4646514395276
no said the captain i make but one bargain and i have agreed with this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till we arrive at boulogne and shall we arrive there safe and sound as true as my name s jack butler well said milady if you keep your word instead of five hundred i will give you a thousand pistoles hurrah for you then my beautiful lady cried the captain and may god often send me such passengers as your ladyship meanwhile said felton convey me to the little bay of you know it was agreed you should put in there the captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers and toward seven o clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay that had been named				116523.88972906202
have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano said danglars to andrea				1419.7078180583487
master friquet the owner of a pistol and of a sword which louvieres had given him had organized a company of rogues like himself and was making a tremendous racket				1284319.5868181763
she has never been so kind before				795.8554788831198
monsieur de beaufort made the experiment a third time but by this time pistache s patience was exhausted he threw himself furiously upon the cane wrested it from the hands of the prince and broke it with his teeth				2045.392329461591
you were deceived sir i was not praying do you think then madame replied felton in the same serious voice but with a milder tone do you think i assume the right of preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her creator				1853267.3694689893
your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight what is the meaning of all this inquired caderousse frowningly of danglars who had assumed an air of utter surprise				1983.2082144725011
bonacieux s glass the contents of a ring which she opened with singular quickness				68491.32381322687
the following day about three o clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count				277.14776715865514
if by the cause of the king you mean that of monsieur de mazarin we do not understand each other i don t say exactly answered the gascon confused				58091.47755125752
though i remember in our affair of the rue férou i received a sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the same effect but this dinner was not intended for you alone porthos said aramis				224.87045542479456
i will make planchet brush my boots and when he has done i will if you like send him to you to brush your shoes he left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell and asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate				1140860.4102825949
you told me that the letter was from the marechal de grammont henrietta said the queen				357.54799322770475
the night gradually drew on and the foliage in the garden assumed a deeper hue				198758.78272956223
this force was therefore wholly insufficient and from time to time the line was broken through by the people and was formed again with difficulty				6207.430914746708
bonacieux help then collecting all her strength she took the head of the young man between her hands looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul passed into that look and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his				1399.1869847017274
milady however smiled in observing that she excelled the young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing				8124.161556588349
one day he had the imprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal				265.668593101382
haven t you some one who will relieve me of my horse groslow whistled and a sailor appeared				1138.530535259229
murmured he growing still paler				3168790.813443023
well said gondy have you kept your word with me not exactly replied the mendicant				1955153.1387987584
my lord i have been so long shut up that i am only of one party i am for fresh air				1544.1463390633119
then as lord leven and the other chieftains recoiled before this unexpected rescue which seemed to come from heaven for the prince they already thought was their prisoner athos and aramis dragged the king from the perjured assembly into which he had so imprudently ventured and throwing themselves on horseback all three returned at full gallop to the royal tent				20005.37250399517
you say truly the gift of poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars besides what would it be to them				108.66451845008207
i see my lord i shall be obliged to fetch a second grimaud very well let us say no more about it				80.68483290234526
d artagnan at first took these weapons for foils and believed them to be buttoned but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every weapon was pointed and sharpened and that at each of these scratches not only the spectators but even the actors themselves laughed like so many madmen				81033.19885052717
mazarin according to his custom was thinking much and saying little				1100.5253108214479
if i am killed well then mother you can also die and there will be an end of our misfortunes it is well replied mercédès with her eloquent glance you are right my love let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young man i assure you we are or rather we shall be very happy				6718.64715797648
valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest you are mistaken sir exclaimed morrel raising himself on one knee his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt you are mistaken valentine dying as she has not only requires a priest but an avenger				21854.84605303535
whom shall i announce said the attendant				1179652.0224973094
lean upon me and let us return to the camp yes said the man who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity but is it not to have me hanged you have my word said he for the second time i give you your life the wounded man sank upon his knees to again kiss the feet of his preserver but d artagnan who had no longer a motive for staying so near the enemy abridged the testimonials of his gratitude				1828.7724397121121
milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital but she would not spare him a single pang				1298785.9954894118
this first moment had been delayed five days which under any other circumstances might have appeared rather long to m bonacieux but he had in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits rochefort had made him ample subjects for reflection and as everybody knows nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection				14702.905404181372
have i not explained your wishes grandpapa said valentine addressing noirtier				1666.665254148413
five minutes afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of mademoiselle d armilly s fingers and mademoiselle danglars was singing brabantio s malediction on desdemona				31984.046659053925
he tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins he had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything				2458.3114621002114
the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before him you have no idea then morrel asked château renaud you do not propose anything oh yes returned the young man smiling on the contrary i have one but i expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a year in the rue meslay you have a sister asked the count				302.2245235260853
the day was passed at saint peter s alone				967.0142374737039
whilst he was thinking that he should first taste the liquor which the tankard contained before taking it to his companions the door of the cellar opened and a man with a lantern in his hands and enveloped in a cloak came and stood just before the hogshead behind which grimaud on hearing him come in instantly crept				443946.33932997705
i did not expect to see you again said he feebly to dantès				367.84018479187813
d artagnan remained therefore alone and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without counting				1482383.403838584
richelieu in fact said aramis it is an absolution according to rule that paper must be torn to pieces said d artagnan who fancied he read in it his sentence of death				677.3970719900568
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the wife of him who pronounces it no madame no the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest poison madame de villefort uttered a wild cry and a hideous and uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features				5248.835734641953
he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to death and she crushed by remorse struck with terror covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue she a poor weak woman without help or the power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will she might at that very moment perhaps be preparing to die				1495.8973626242828
but the count completely baffled the procureur and prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never varying smile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming				1151274.20400807
everything in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose				1751.5910732294074
i will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump said he well done said the englishman				1236.942693831044
you sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces and now you wish him to complete his education in the parisian world				691.8598535999424
then said albert you became the property of this man no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople				1484036.953528161

now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression				33698.83621798887

suddenly we heard loud cries and listening discerned that they were cries of joy				1108.0837162710334
they both dismounted consigned their horses to the lackey who had opened the door and disappeared in the garden				2368.082770008902

anyone but a man of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward s extraordinary repugnance for the count s projected drive without the walls but the count was too curious to let bertuccio off from this little journey				2187.5749856303387
i think nothing i quote a fact that is all				188.1583144617604

it was delightful weather				10419.967005720222
the abbé replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his eyes but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same				1124.106252833271

ha cried porthos who was not completely taken in by d artagnan s gasconades				1335264.5660773835
really i think the thing very difficult not at all cried d artagnan who was anxious the matter should be accomplished on the contrary i think it very easy				1308.306558296619

a tall pale clerk his face shaded by a forest of virgin hair opened the door and bowed with the air of a man forced at once to respect in another lofty stature which indicated strength the military dress which indicated rank and a ruddy countenance which indicated familiarity with good living				3371.8300145508997

the latter on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him endeavored to raise himself up in his bed but he was too weak and exhausted by the effort he fell back again almost senseless				1629794.7015286621
then rising with his head still covered in the tone of a judge rather than a prisoner charles began				1535.8887327003763
i give you his very words and if the marquis chooses to be candid he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter that is true answered the marquis				115322.96112881333

morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding				2157760.3681003284
if i am not mistaken those are citizens helmeted and mailed armed with good muskets as in the time of the league and whose eyes are so intently fixed on this window that they will see you if you raise that curtain much and now come to the other side what do you see				1016.1600683625863
when do you want your twelve hundred francs said he to caderousse				413.01670692211536
i never rightly understood those men said the queen as she watched him retiring from her presence and it is now too late for in a year the king will be of age in twenty four hours d artagnan and porthos conducted mazarin to the queen and the one received his commission the other his patent of nobility				17621.79396385267
adieu thus tis quite decided said d artagnan that what i have to offer to you does not tempt you on the contrary it would tempt me were i any other man rejoined aramis but i repeat i am made up of contradictions				144873.2556369858
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of your health and strength can now only sympathize in my joys and sorrows without being able to take any active part in them				107.35404479056753

each of these mobs was led by a chief one of whom appeared to belong not to the people but to the honorable corporation of mendicants and the other notwithstanding his affected imitation of the people might easily be discerned to be a gentleman				837.5002340160552
two minutes later the thunder of a horse s hoofs was heard upon the road it was grimaud on his way to paris				517.7421748886225
his first care on entering it was to lock up in an old bureau with a new lock his bag of money and then as soon as supper was ready he sent away the waiter who brought it up and sat down to table				678.4460446051838
here it is replied d artagnan taking it from his finger				1802.4265410073663
i am going to fight because i am going to fight answered porthos reddening				3409818.3257110436
well thought of porthos this time you have an idea undoubtedly said porthos drawing himself up at athos s compliment as there is a diamond let us sell it but said d artagnan it is the queen s diamond the stronger reason why it should be sold replied athos				108.89217385465106

who could be dead in that house which villefort himself had called accursed				1325069.3114174993
at first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves				2972.3253643312078
let us not talk about money if you please it is humiliating then you no longer love me said the procurator s wife slowly and sadly				3663.998338093428
this began to be annoying				918863.7534012424
in the first place said he i wish my lackey placed with me fully armed we hastened to obey this order for you will please to understand monsieur we were disposed to do everything your friend could desire				10056.800704402887

morrel in a corner of the carriage allowed his brother in law s gayety to expend itself in words while he felt equal inward joy which however betrayed itself only in his countenance				694.1839667430164
besides the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his heart				395.42661100877615

grimaud in fact was not only the accountant but the armorer of the party and as he was a man full of forethought these trousers carefully rolled up in his valise contained every sort of tool for immediate use				3480.0712421236767
the same evening the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say it was i who sold the arsenic to the gentleman and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they will recognize twenty				12110.068902438545

i will answer for it her resentment will not hold out against such an attention monsieur cardinal you know that i do not like worldly pleasures the queen will only be the more grateful to you as she knows your antipathy for that amusement besides it will be an opportunity for her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn herself we shall see monsieur cardinal we shall see said the king who in his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little about and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread was ready to make up all differences with her we shall see but upon my honor you are too indulgent toward her sire said the cardinal leave severity to your ministers				1765506.764985703

with the deputy s knowledge of crime and criminals every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence				13064.345216526674

seven o clock said grimaud who had not spoken a word				455.50059293958714
and now resumed bertuccio your excellency may perhaps be able to comprehend that this place which i revisit for the first time this garden the actual scene of my crime must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause				2666.490143019391
his first idea was that this man intended to do him some harm but on the contrary he saw him fall on his knees before him with his hands clasped				49967.64113106837

pray tell me what you think baron for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their hands thomson french are perfectly solvent replied danglars with an almost mocking smile but the word unlimited in financial affairs is so extremely vague is in fact unlimited said monte cristo				318.99010508797045

this is the abbé of whom i spoke said the doctor to d avrigny				2957.97437193188
no nonsense my good fellow silver simply round coins with the head of some monarch or other on them				112.61132408818432

by the way this is merely a simple question when this sort of people marry their sons do they give them any fortune oh that depends upon circumstances				752.2694408026673
this time however his address although polite was cooler than usual				3026.6540447910497
wasn t i right to part with the horses madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt				6344.238956871722
the cardinal as it appears pursues her and persecutes her more than ever				1670.8109340985613
save my husband				1132.7131416075676
as you left the choice of your costumes to me said the count to the two friends i have had these brought as they will be the most worn this year and they are most suitable on account of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre				239279.91259081662
well said the jailer are you more reasonable today dantès made no reply				951.1300051555892
towns fled from them like shadows on their path and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once reached				532994.2661695933
in short his whole appearance produced on the mind the impression of a corpse with living eyes and nothing could be more startling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly lighting up these organs while the rest of the rigid and marble like features were utterly deprived of the power of participation				936619.5275597712
the guests were still at table and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling				10773.085846411195
i am cold sir said mousqueton				2230.480655009756
a rich englishman continued the abbé who had been his companion in misfortune but had been released from prison during the second restoration was possessed of a diamond of immense value this jewel he bestowed on dantès upon himself quitting the prison as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantès had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement				115005.4452782126
an overpowering sadness took possession of the young man his hands relaxed their hold the objects in the room gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall				1093.425589004329
as the day advanced the tumult became greater				151520.37448577053
make room cried d artagnan				9.512886945116833
as for you morrel this is the secret of my conduct towards you				55.31554068221283
he would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart and by their union constitute a passion so strange and as it were diabolical				928541.3575514759
look at it and tell me what you think of it what a wicked looking crooked staircase said château renaud with a smile				454.834277967044
he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the traveller				10752.21900840344
as to the second reproach i have heard it said that she does not love the english but an englishman well and by my faith said athos it must be acknowledged that this englishman is worthy of being loved				5959.360799246973
for a mind so perspicuous as that of d artagnan this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future				1378.0412009502802
he was to have waited for me at the corner of the rue du musée but strange to say he was not there when i returned monsieur morrel exclaimed a voice on the stairs monsieur morrel it is his voice said julie				15068.637330453497
as for me i am sure of it said the duke				491.64235039753504
valentine then took the dictionary and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages				31185.832761159003
enter gentlemen said laporte since the queen desires you so to do then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door and to advance on tiptoe				1183031.8666060842
she will try to seduce you perhaps she will try to kill you				53.48883152649062
suddenly the boat leaned on one side beneath a new and unexpected weight and grimaud uttered a shout of joy every one turned around and beheld athos livid his eyes dim and his hands trembling supporting himself on the edge of the boat				1884.8383991873447
those who have once beheld such a spectacle know that there is nothing more solemn more striking than the raging sea rolling with its deafening roar its dark billows beneath the pale light of a wintry moon				576697.3142954938
you must take a carriage and an escort and guard the prisoner with the greatest care d artagnan took the letter touched his hat with his hand turned round upon his heel like a drill sergeant and a moment afterward was heard in his dry and monotonous tone commanding four men and an escort a carriage and a horse five minutes afterward the wheels of the carriage and the horses shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of the courtyard				7491.047848329113
you must be cruelly bored here that was my intention but my dear friend i have one thing to confess to you what s that it is that as i was cruelly bored as you say and as i had the seventy five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me in order to amuse myself i invited a gentleman who was traveling this way to walk up and proposed a cast of dice				2970.8942206504425
two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the door which was made of three planks the door had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on				1316.2158234520966
stand aside he cried stand off the road what do you want asked a voice				773.6412500582439
however i have turned the business over to morcerf so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own part i care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth francs wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at francs each he seems to have a mania for diamonds said morcerf smiling and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his pockets filled for the sake of strewing them along the road as tom thumb did his flint stones perhaps he has discovered some mine said madame danglars				586.9272153640513
i hope it does not exceed she stopped speech failed her				175.07175910873272
he gave us some very fine horses and moreover very handsome saddles said porthos who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own				969.3040415000163
as she was coming down she thought she recognized the french officer who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my father placed so much confidence for he knew that all the soldiers of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous				16064.28603714617
the queen was ignorant where the mercer s young wife was but had promised to have her sought for but this promise was very vague and did not at all reassure d artagnan				68.6803805735023
for one moment the young man forgot his habitual respect he threw himself on his father s neck				10218.572776731926
for the demon of speculation drew a line or in other words projected a street at the farther side of the kitchen garden				2359.234073968707
debray to whom she had run with the first instinct of a woman towards the man she loves and who yet betrays her debray could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he				590.3425563586035
it is unnecessary to state that in the eyes of the young man valentine did not suffer by the contrast				1148733.08409011
he waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior for fear he might be mistaken but this gesture being repeated he left the ranks and advanced to receive orders				5825.74424680335
according to the count s directions danglars was waited on by vampa who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy then having conducted him to the road and pointed to the post chaise left him leaning against a tree				3885.4446680722504
the queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister				1731.1216827783594
his lackey who by an unforeseen piece of ill luck had quarreled with the officers disguised as stable lads miserable scoundrel cried d artagnan you were all in the plot then				1199.0660586426145
d artagnan unfolded the paper				1191.7647146836944
he turned up a king				463.5998896671651
he would never think of faring in the same manner as his master he only drank from the cask				232840.4002807433

they made him enter this carriage the officer placed himself by his side the door was locked and they were left in a rolling prison				1253.1380974390036
as for monte cristo after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if dazzled by internal light				1140.146246379093
it is a shame to leave him to be educated by our enemies who will give him evil counsel whereas brought up by the coadjutor for instance he would imbibe national principles and love his people that night the question was secretly agitated and on the morrow the gray and black cloaks the patrols of armed shop people and the bands of mendicants reappeared				7426.5805970518
how can i if her husband fails in controlling her asked lucien you know the character of the baroness no one has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases ah if i were in your place said albert				349.55080711487346
old pastrini our former acquaintance received the traveller at the door hat in hand				205.55411712811346
d artagnan went from captain groslow to colonel harrison and from colonel harrison to his friends				474.7866943900033
come said andrea you are a man void of compassion i ll have you turned out this made the keeper turn around and he burst into a loud laugh				2374.6343422051423

my lord one last favor what				599.6007854791932

and king charles is well as i have just heard he is dead my lord said aramis				76.15271893480904
i am just as poor a gascon as when i saw you at meung twenty two years ago you know alas and he concluded his speech with a deep sigh				569.7163183321614
still when morrel had finished he shut his eyes several times which was his manner of saying no no said morrel you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first i do signified the old man				124.33510794626989
richelieu the cardinal after having read these two lines sank into a profound reverie but he did not return the paper to d artagnan				70.17143199387684
whatever you say sir replied the englishman laughing i am like my house and do not do such things no the commission i ask is quite different name it sir i beg you are the inspector of prisons i have been so these fourteen years you keep the registers of entries and departures i do to these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners there are special reports on every prisoner well sir i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an abbé who disappeared suddenly				3799.6576308351327
the king therefore arose a minute after and putting the money which lay before him into his pocket the major part of which arose from his winnings la vieuville said he take my place i must speak to monsieur de tréville on an affair of importance				4561.568053513307
morrel you are going to destroy yourself indeed count said morrel shuddering what has put this into your head i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the count and here is proof of what i say and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of paper which morrel had placed over the letter he had begun and took the latter in his hands				515.4979877529582
he will have fallen asleep waiting for me or else he will have returned home where he will have learned that a woman had been there				764.8125678994904
no madame i will not thus waste your time				646.2569165103558
yes i understand my lord observes that there will be enough to go around we shall take to ourselves the poniards and the rope replied the duke				726.9208477509441

the queen gave them to me the queen requires them again				283.9402011377108
the old man obeyed				1372.671345613137
ho said porthos raising himself in his bed what does she say d artagnan requested the servant to wait in the next room and when the door was closed he sprang up from his bed and read rapidly whilst porthos looked at him with starting eyes not daring to ask a single question				613.5925286726786
they thought this order did not concern me sir nevertheless if you wish it i am ready to go ah				534.1617930154796
ah i shall know how to make you leave your home replied albert clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which monte cristo did not lose sight of				1229.7507714261878
however because i was prudent you must not take me for a fool				18001.80500993816
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination				2846.783842995422
generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied danglars				562.4032525620017
it was a dull foggy night				787.3824159548471
at length he met a belated passenger went up to him and spoke a few words to him				32.101655264564705
are we not eating a horse porthos				154.0192976144083
i had the honor of asking you why you altered your costume				3591.1740957422044
does he still live inquired the innkeeper				27374.02927191814
that s lucky said athos shrugging his shoulders				861.81681792086
a considerable number of clowns were assembled and rendered homage to their lord				294.7272684660503
teresa had a great desire to see this ball				32201.993204290608
i will therefore fight in my doublet like yourself come come enough of such compliments cried porthos				144.00220409179104
hide thy diamonds bury thy gold shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty liberty for a prison a living body for a corpse as he thus reasoned monte cristo walked down the rue de la caisserie				1154849.1480330846
then the postscript well what of the postscript then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the letter certainly the abbé busoni and myself have a small account open between us				357.74087187618244
i thought there were four of you listen to me sir				452.80576415667406
suppose i happen to strangle him to be sure there would only be a swiss the less in the world but you will not do so i hope				1319.5300602036855
tell the comte de la fere to come to me said madame de chevreuse i want to speak to him and i said the coadjutor want it to be thought that i do not speak to him				26.987059295108104
oh my god				303.1906051493753
he will spoil the feast i will direct him to stand behind your chair and since he doesn t speak your highness will neither see nor hear him and with a little effort can imagine him a hundred miles away do you know my friend i find one thing very evident in all this you distrust me my lord the day after to morrow is pentecost well what is pentecost to me				76.06866573049801
grimaud sprang up				971.2967832789959
to wait replied athos				5.555631841892328
they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot				50211.741526396974
this night i am determined to be free and if i defend myself or call or cry out i will kill thee on the honor of a gentleman at this moment the clock struck				2064.7468538286835
another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rudder				830193.8929131668
you acknowledge of course that you owe this sum to him yes he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly five years ago when are you to pay half the of this month half the of next just so and now here are francs payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned to our house by the holders i recognize them said morrel whose face was suffused as he thought that for the first time in his life he would be unable to honor his own signature				11853.989198549476
we can not say how long the night seemed to milady but d artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds and invaded the chamber with its paleness				213920.40781112
they heard the guard going its rounds				661825.79097009
this circumstance had moreover the effect of changing the conversation an hour afterwards the two friends returned to their hotel				3462.637966018882
she would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few minutes when suddenly madame danglars hand pressed on her arm aroused her from her lethargy				9489.026204144788
certainly not exclaimed mazarin				215.94543266257412
i don t think he put the faucet in again				298.915088979353
well said porthos and aramis together as soon as the cardinal was out of hearing well he signed the paper she required i know it said athos coolly since here it is and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached their quarters except to give the watchword to the sentinels				8872.5312650109
go to work labor young man struggle ardently and courageously live yourself your mother and sister with the most rigid economy so that from day to day the property of those whom i leave in your hands may augment and fructify				1185776.6376523506
what are you thinking of this evening bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage				552.266986726767
i must wait				6672.379176116411
athos by signs desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine				2035.280914022705
the others followed				5586.567990218634
come he said it is only a veiled lady some foreign princess perhaps the mother of cavalcanti				2398.0818075663983
nay madame i pray you pardon this little traitor				901356.8971605424
when they entered d artagnan s chamber it was empty the landlord dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger had consistent with the character he had given himself judged it prudent to decamp				1200261.173935135
i will so advantageously bestow piastres that the person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for peppino and during that year another skilfully placed piastres will afford him the means of escaping from his prison and do you feel sure of succeeding pardieu exclaimed the man in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french				2484.2904081598704
i could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me and yet for what other cause could she have returned to paris for the cause which today takes us to england and what is this cause demanded aramis				182.9419539472068
general said the president we acknowledge no king louis xviii or an ex emperor but his majesty the emperor and king driven from france which is his kingdom by violence and treason excuse me gentlemen said the general you may not acknowledge louis xviii but i do as he has made me a baron and a field marshal and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy return to france sir said the president rising with gravity be careful what you say your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the island of elba and have deceived us				361.71677323983664
by adding all that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the seriousness of which for the rest the queen s letter short but explicit gave him the clue				1413383.6171635045
let me be on my guard and he assumed a look of stupidity which mendori or bellerose two of the first actors of the day might have envied				1038542.3535269402
the oval face was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought his eyes were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the features are encircled with black hair the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself				3990.3399174890756
d artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an englishman to refuse to pledge him				33.509113790928744
tomorrow this evening perhaps i shall see him again and then the past will no longer exist this evening asked milady roused from her reverie by these words				702.751039772052
give us the clergy and the people of whom you can dispose and i will bring you the citizens and the parliament with these four elements paris is ours in a week and believe me monsieur coadjutor the court will give from fear what it will not give from good will it was now the coadjutor s turn to fix his piercing eyes on louvieres				15600.226946225801
you were recommended to monsieur de tréville were you not yes monseigneur but in that unfortunate affair at meung the letter was lost replied his eminence yes i know that				698.8269828331325
the two ladies entered the drawing room with that sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication				28024.602129150746
no objection was raised and the infant was given up to her				203.64584029729073
i who had sacrificed for you the baronne de i know it well the comtesse de monsieur porthos be generous you are right madame and i will not finish but it was my husband who would not hear of lending madame coquenard said porthos remember the first letter you wrote me and which i preserve engraved in my memory the procurator s wife uttered a groan				3028.842758998408
let me see your plan i dare say it is a pretty one why not				559.2290097293653
he proposed to fernand to accompany him fernand agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general				1384.1849533583168
and all present even including cavalcanti and his son notwithstanding the stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man				150.91905899817573
dying in the arms of his children he had been by them laid by the side of his wife who had preceded him in eternity by two years				751.9351973382751
the island of tiboulen dantès although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath and as his right hand prepared as he was for every chance held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his arm and then his body but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower				53874.67825955047
gentlemen return your swords to their scabbards well provided you replace your pistols in your belt willingly and d artagnan set the example				2159.8117339472274
aramis you certainly are full of wisdom the young men burst into a laugh and as may be supposed the affair had no other sequel				1175334.3038584997
in fact i have rarely seen such excess of impudence your majesty on your side said d artagnan is as much mistaken as to our intentions as the cardinal mazarin has always been you are in error sir answered the queen				340.30509975256905

they passed into the next drawing room where tea was prepared				28883.303741158987
just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge				15481.452832911215
the palace of justice would not be burned down for everybody monseigneur you think then that the fire at the palace of justice was not caused by chance asked richelieu in the tone with which he would have put a question of no importance				4311.4519200882805
do not be angry we can try it caderousse went to the window touched the glass with it and found it would cut				11528.958317679024
marie michon continued athos				70.6749679247165
now sir pray do not be offended at the question i am about to put to you as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron				27913.481071603732
your song is as dismal as a de profundis and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here we must hear such things as these no mortal can hold out silence then exclaimed another stern voice which milady recognized as that of felton				1017.1810282142142
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the island of elba has maintained his relations with italy and france i am sir said the king much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint jacques				792763.014905223
three arcades were before them and the middle one was used as a door				193.9575188638578
then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase with a strength apparently above that of a woman but finding she could not accomplish this she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard the point of which repeatedly glittered through the wood				7570.955397179778
god help me chapter				79.085923199006
it seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended from the chest to the head				392.4146754214658
as for us we were three days without anything to eat or drink so that we began to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest when we saw la gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board				9073.448508571986
if i should be killed one of you must take it and continue the route if he be killed it will be another s turn and so on provided a single one arrives that is all that is required bravo d artagnan your opinion is mine cried athos besides we must be consistent i am going to take the waters you will accompany me				88.60215071431803
at the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her it was mme				178.05494630928297
those who have read the memoirs of mme				237.56886845039287
maximilian sprang down the staircase and threw his arms round his father s neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his right hand on morrel s breast				1330.0022907776354
but said morrel i thought this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for m noirtier i know it is very bitter said valentine so bitter that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter				16799.86242823859
so much the worse and so much the better it need not be said that d artagnan was still thinking of the husband				848.887378115564
well then marie michon had supper with her follower and then in accordance with the permission given her she entered the chamber of her host kitty meanwhile taking possession of an armchair in the room first entered where they had taken their supper really monsieur said madame de chevreuse unless you are the devil in person i don t know how you could become acquainted with all these details a charming woman was that marie michon resumed athos one of those wild creatures who are constantly conceiving the strangest ideas				8263.233909175615
she tried to go toward the window for air but she could only stretch forth her arms her legs failed her and she sank into an armchair				21219.220915008256
are you a man				132.65832684381556
he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his hand				193.91054158854675
my own service said d artagnan				7.656749521257872
i recognized him when the wind blew upon his cloak the devil said athos musingly				2695482.8145725136
let us go said athos and aramis				198.32961000711416
the flickering light of the two candles showed fitful phantom shadows in the lofty room				192.5301861447246
women say those things but never do them you do not know mercédès what she threatens she will do idiot muttered danglars whether she kill herself or not what matter provided dantès is not captain before mercédès should die replied fernand with the accents of unshaken resolution i would die myself that s what i call love said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than ever				1699.5923890772322
the curtains were half drawn and only admitted the mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries				1040970.7541797287
recollect our only desire is to carry out in a fitting manner the last wishes of our friend				591.3754278497778
she then turned towards the avenue				27171.65100334421
he s heavy though for an old and thin man said one as he raised the head				383.40830598062223
the former had no doubt finished his questions for a moment later he said good night and carelessly followed the same path taken by the first cavalier				8888.71594500731
oh bid him enter and the queen advanced to meet the messenger whose hand she seized affectionately whilst he knelt down and presented a letter to her contained in a case of gold				1940.9639647595368
you understand then comte de la fere you understand chevalier d herblay that i am altogether and always at your service athos and aramis bowed and went out				509.27510788499245
if that is really so how came you in the bastille how i came there or rather why i am there replied bonacieux that is entirely impossible for me to tell you because i don t know myself but to a certainty it is not for having knowingly at least disobliged monsieur the cardinal you must nevertheless have committed a crime since you are here and are accused of high treason of high treason cried bonacieux terrified of high treason				5667.804703097782
and taking it from felton he cast a rapid glance over the paper and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him he placed it on the table took a pen and prepared to sign it				89.91541715987846
deserted she repeated ah yes i am indeed deserted				8488.161667822358
a tall young man with light hair clear gray eyes and thin and compressed lips dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell eye glass suspended by a silken thread and which by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his eye entered with a half official air without smiling or speaking				1871.3247726803454
bonacieux you will ruin us all but i have sworn to kill that man said d artagnan				31.775934925899467

there is the wounded man said de guiche passing close to the augustine brother				2062.25744924084
a worthy man who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting his mistress married and securing her a position				4470.324218324847
it was a pity this scene had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury				334893.9057116962
the solitary light burning at the catalans that first sight of the château d if which told him whither they were leading him the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard his despair when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality				5394.693799267379
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged				1043464.5389197787

a burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain and two or three heads carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment appeared through the openings of the tapestry				72427.26781638064
those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm				1262.2639751531083
it is well known how violent the king s prejudices were against the queen and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men				1214.9358500783044
athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice then the tall man made a sign to the musketeer that he might come in				934.1186123086397

d artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable and having again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton and paid his bill to the host he resumed his route with planchet already relieved of one of his led horses				976.7401018541598
he formed therefore the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their past hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future				1477.566814990657
do you propose entering any horses at either of these races count i shall do whatever they do at paris madame if i have the good fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of amusement are you fond of horses count i have passed a considerable part of my life in the east madame and you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two things the fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women nay count said the baroness it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first you see madame how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here at this instant the favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some words in an undertone				17060.711720047664
porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling then addressing d artagnan you know the watchword he said				437.23822828529023
do you not think with me m de villefort that general quesnel whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush it is probable sire replied villefort				284.22358511328173
besides i am a picard then it is understood said d artagnan you would rather be killed than desert your post yes monsieur and there is nothing i would not do to prove to monsieur that i am attached to him good said d artagnan to himself				185.9413761903624
i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches				54607.189964907695
when ali was wanted one stroke was given two summoned baptistin and three bertuccio				1935.403992559364
go and take this key with you you are active vigorous and you have arms				477.08199326372966
they are good soldiers fit to confront the two violent adversaries whose address and resolution your eminence is fearful of oh cried athos				163.67663788809494
his service does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together ah my dear father exclaimed andrea evidently charmed with the idea of his speedy departure				5391.258180066424
he entered third and aramis who shut the gate after him last				3103.622214950391
la carconte continued to gaze on him for some time then shrugging her shoulders she took her seat immediately opposite to him				32.731369844392525
d artagnan remember this				1006.6583072793187
because he had no cash to save				170810.3791200086
amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valérien our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to water the caravans				1136152.5426148516
the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the defence				22746.519750855165
do you think so said the host bewildered boy see if the mule belonging to the monk is still in the stable there is no mule cried he to whom this question was addressed				2122.182075081192
franz and debray exchanged some words in a whisper and morrel rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the count who was walking in a retired path with emmanuel				898.0761118460056
did he take baptistin with him no my lord call him then i wish to speak to him the concierge went to seek the valet de chambre and returned with him in an instant				1215.7216709161924
but on taking this knife felton a terrible idea occurred to me				71.7661690098143
ah i recollect you asked for a place at my window you shall have it but let us first sit down to table for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is ready as he spoke a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment saying al suo commodo the two young men arose and entered the breakfast room				186.0382222254357
d artagnan had his sword and placed two pistols in his belt then both mounted and departed quietly				5045.445844848537
i have not seen you nor your friends and i don t think you could gather all that dust that i saw planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of paris you are right my dear monsieur bonacieux my friends and i have been on a little journey far from here oh lord no				940.4713515816921
let the cardinal take care of going alone to visit the comte de la fere said d artagnan for the count must be furious comminges began to laugh				2430.2853791570556
i had about a million in their hands but warned in time i withdrew it a month ago ah mon dieu exclaimed danglars they have drawn on me for francs well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per cent yes but it is too late said danglars i have honored their bills then said monte cristo here are francs gone after hush do not mention these things said danglars then approaching monte cristo he added especially before young m cavalcanti after which he smiled and turned towards the young man in question				621.8122313679687
this belonged to one of his friends at the café de paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after andrea had left was convinced that he had let his horse to the count of mauléon rue saint dominique that being the name and address on the card				87947.36836905233
grimaud alone was calm as ever				1789.882684606164
well you do not answer cardinal what do you think about it i am thinking madame of the allusion made by that insolent gentleman whom you have caused to be arrested to the duke of buckingham to him whom you allowed to be assassinated to the duchess de chevreuse whom you suffered to be exiled to the duc de beaufort whom you imprisoned but if he made allusion to me it was because he is ignorant of the relation in which i stand to you anne drew up as she always did when anything touched her pride				2226.7548725867127
cambalet his niece while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and guards of the cardinal duke all things which appeared to d artagnan monstrous impossibilities				759001.2340387693
but then that is all the more reason why we should not abandon the august head so threatened athos you are becoming mad no my friend athos gently replied but de winter sought us out in france and introduced us monsieur d herblay and myself to madame henrietta				7380.447171157481
what i was saying villefort was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion they had however what supplied the place of those fine qualities replied the young man and that was fanaticism				1895671.8028404184
do you intend to stand on ceremony because you are less attached to me than you were oh				646.6400720731767
these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them this is my treasure my beloved friend and with this you have made me rich and happy				6792.485175473052
grimaud in a swoon was tied securely to a horse				896.7623889462295
where am i said she				132.5829466163803
nay said she do not smile it ill accords with the expression of your countenance and i am sure it does not spring from your heart				392.4646390809166
he did so and thus doubled his income				31793.670699243354
now sir said d artagnan wishing to change the conversation here are fifty pistoles that the count has sent you by the same courier				26155.503821120263
if that were so he was indeed a highly favored prince				1261.2062882369346
it was with him she agreed and not with me he even has in his pocket a letter from that person who attaches great importance to you as i have heard him say but how did you become concerned in this villainous affair he proposed to me to undertake it with him and i agreed and how much did she give you for this fine enterprise a hundred louis well come said the young man laughing she thinks i am worth something				5757.5318302045525
as monsieur porthos is a very boastful man he insists that nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess whom he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure it is a wound that confines him to his bed ah and a master stroke too i assure you				65.73846405974028
the abbé was a man of the world and had moreover mixed in the first society of the day he wore an air of melancholy dignity which dantès thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding				318246.5951274373
accept that which the bearer brings you make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman and think of me who kisses tenderly your black eyes				601.5584684199478
my dear mr mordaunt said mazarin hoping by a display of affected pity to catch the young man in a snare how extremely your history interests me				91.8424278180754
i understand you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the subject				1146.2504795737825
anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival				29469.27172588807
broussel halloo				1801554.5689865018
but do you wish to marry andrea my dear m danglars that you are asking so many questions ma foi said danglars it would not be a bad speculation i fancy and you know i am a speculator you are not thinking of mademoiselle danglars i hope you would not like poor andrea to have his throat cut by albert albert repeated danglars shrugging his shoulders ah well he would care very little about it i think but he is betrothed to your daughter i believe well m de morcerf and i have talked about this marriage but madame de morcerf and albert you do not mean to say that it would not be a good match indeed i imagine that mademoiselle danglars is as good as m de morcerf mademoiselle danglars fortune will be great no doubt especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes oh i do not mean her fortune only but tell me what why did you not invite m and madame de morcerf to your dinner i did so but he excused himself on account of madame de morcerf being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of sea air yes yes said danglars laughing it would do her a great deal of good why so because it is the air she always breathed in her youth monte cristo took no notice of this ill natured remark				6779.050527475999
help no voice replied to hers the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity the officer seemed a statue				2755.382026222102
yes said château renaud these italians are well named and badly dressed you are fastidious château renaud replied debray those clothes are well cut and quite new that is just what i find fault with				5397.755812581983
what ails you said he at length				12933.054722559935
his eminence is the most illustrious politician of times past of times present and probably of times to come				1508.164063867026
this time as he was well attended he looked at them sternly and made a sign with his eye and hand for d artagnan to follow him				35.00580338678098
the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop				1754.0299523622296
emmanuel followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough faces of seven or eight half naked sailors				1893.1468288013355
reunited oh it was in vain she told me you would not come				1713.330898622561
come in my braves said the king come in i am going to scold you the musketeers advanced bowing d artagnan following closely behind them				106.38216746703036
i wrote verses in the style of benserade you my lord yes i shall i repeat to you some of my verses just as you please my lord				284.0083121045819
but remember also that if by your fault any evil happens to d artagnan i will find you wherever you may be for the purpose of ripping up your belly oh monsieur said planchet humiliated by the suspicion and moreover terrified at the calm air of the musketeer				911.584772605038
come continued d artagnan who irritated that instead of listening to him athos seemed to be attending to his own thoughts you have never found yourself the worse for my advice				1187.3132057491437
meanwhile madame danglars veiled and uneasy awaited the return of debray in the little green room seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that morning sent and which it must be confessed debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman				416.46032966778967
see they are here and at the same minute a carriage with smoking horses accompanied by two mounted gentlemen arrived at the gate which opened before them				107.91172315666157
an unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever				4320.799757487218
the monk s eyes glittered				5095734.694969309
avenged yourself said the baron				5805.932469187377
then he explained to him the cause of his visit and the service he required of him				40.30346151176595
noirtier made a sign that he wished to speak				1128.3008776763006
truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate				73199.99433499298
it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory				1339610.1214032534
oh monsieur chevalier do you love that woman still no no it is one of my friends who loves her monsieur athos this gentleman here i cried athos with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is about to tread upon an adder				2010064.9582410087
and then there are robbers said la carconte				5467.850276677994
is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words oh my god no said lord de winter with apparent good nature				3132.032778986627
i set off for france after having fixed upon the plan				1176.7108843619799
she was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback				2735.114308711924
chatillon saw the motion and put his hand to his sword				1372.3702899082389
but who told you i was inactive but if the plot had succeeded i wished it to do so i thought your excellence considered the death of charles i as a misfortune necessary to the welfare of england yes his death but it would have been more seemly not upon the scaffold why so asked mordaunt				1886.7357391895612
you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy change of scene and morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity				31566.26316067758
d artagnan passed to the head of the column and leaving his friends under the guard of porthos went straight to harrison who recognized him as having met him at cromwell s and received him as politely as a man of his breeding and disposition could				52552.946974040875
you will not be pitiless cried mordaunt				1730.9194561209533
his first remark on entering was you know sir i do not speak french i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy				1227096.8202916817
uneasy and almost crazed she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather				5934.791576412373
porthos mechanically drew his dagger from the scabbard				11070.818765617589
the citizen made a fresh pause and continued i have a wife who is seamstress to the queen monsieur and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty				4774.003738072154
all four once more together				615.5157634066013
yes he has a wife who through everything has behaved like an angel he has a daughter who was about to marry the man she loved but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man he has besides a son a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows				96045.47872892127
if you are willing gentlemen i will sleep across your doorway and you will then be certain that nobody can reach you and on what will you sleep said d artagnan				70.74587551959779
now as d artagnan used no ceremony with aramis seeing that bazin forgot to announce him he announced himself				174.77940356184675
he was a man between thirty nine and forty years of age of medium height but a very well proportioned figure with an intellectual and animated physiognomy his beard black and his hair turning gray as often happens when people have found life either too gay or too sad more especially when they happen to be of swart complexion				25336.885953783894
are the oars in the boat everything is ready tis well mordaunt knelt down and fastened one end of the train to the spigot in order that he might have nothing to do but to set it on fire at the opposite end with the match				152890.18605395922
in the middle of the lawn i stopped to light it then i continued my path				21426.106327024354
but as we have said he was active strong and full of presence of mind				703.8375957948751
at last a nightingale lost in a thicket of shrubs in the midst of its most melodious cadences had fluted low and lower into stillness and fallen asleep				1910.2580745060677
we are reluctant to leave for a single moment men whom our lackeys know to be millionaires				703806.1161190285
then in spite of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion				756613.4306230304
d artagnan perceived that he was enforcing prudence with respect to himself				174.3131485374143
napoleon would doubtless have deprived villefort of his office had it not been for noirtier who was all powerful at court and thus the girondin of and the senator of protected him who so lately had been his protector				14605.414100371945
athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain in the rear and advanced alone				1058.5551250660083
the corsican ogre chapter				231.7418124677335
his granddaughter				16854.69752344875
d artagnan approached the sovereign with every mark of profound respect and having fallen on his knees presented to her the cardinal s letter it was however merely a letter of introduction				604994.0946977971
its agent who will in ten minutes present himself to receive the amount of a bill of francs i will not say granted but offered me three months				2665.226589797401
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied monte cristo				174.81357684101502
albert attributed to franz s absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask				3735.252424102373
the officer looked at me with astonishment and then said what is your business with me monsieur				1011.4235903792062
him i can place at your disposal it is count de rochefort i know him also but unfortunately he is not in paris my lord he has been for three days at the rue cassette and wherefore has he not been to see me he was told my lord will pardon me certainly speak that your lordship was about to treat with the court gondy bit his lips				457.58547043820363
fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the contrary overcome fate				2063.717273381597
your history is quite a romance and the world which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself				904.221675700122
there let us dine then said porthos it is getting cold the friends at ease with regard to the future did honor to the repast the remains of which were abandoned to mousqueton bazin planchet and grimaud				944.2026768943537
serve us up the best supper you can and especially give us some good wine bazin bowed low sighed and left the room				181.67649264167522
oh exclaimed morrel with a glance full of bitter reproach do you think it possible that i could be listen said the count				278.5497587028951
i was going to say that i received a letter almost to the same effect you yes from the abbé busoni no from whom then from an englishman called lord wilmore who takes the name of sinbad the sailor and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the abbé busoni you are mistaken there i am ahead of you you have seen him then yes once where ah that is just what i can not tell you if i did i should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do and what did the letter contain read it you are poor and your future prospects are dark and gloomy				1502040.1797120397
but the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit and their lugubrious looks settled down into resigned countenances				62976.93063614232
it was done on purpose for me i am sure of it sir said the baroness humbly are you not aware that the man employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to law with him that orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty				6187.353664080489
the other of mature age seemed to have the former one under her charge and was cold dry and yellow the true type of a duenna or a devotee				1191405.7315762811
are we to pass the night in the king s room asked d artagnan				53.67395095706754
the carriage stopped at the door of the palace				2177.5974458000715
now take me aboard and return to your post for they will soon be here i am ready it is important that none of your crew should see me i have but one man on board and i am as sure of him as i am of myself				750.5349283018186
but now her position in life is assured continued caderousse no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her she is rich a countess and yet caderousse paused				2764.9016443062906
danglars signature the next morning dawned dull and cloudy				1241068.984169042
but raoul said aramis				28.687282198099957
who are these gentleman three of the king s musketeers				697.2140306624939
mother nanette he could say no more but though he hadn t strength to speak he had enough for action				1670.8045604728163
that you may be sure said the gascon means something they then at the same instant perceived a large lantern carried on a pole appear on the deck defining the forms of shadows behind it				85.35941928419592
yes yours your own property sir my right hand correspondent is signalling let him signal sir you have distracted me i shall be fined that will cost you a hundred francs you see it is your interest to take my bank notes sir my right hand correspondent redoubles his signals he is impatient never mind take these and the count placed the packet in the man s hands				510.82557653376597
and now good night go to your rooms and try to sleep away all recollections of this evening				570.1152576282127
what doest thou here good for nothing she said and why art thou not at notre dame i have been there mother said friquet but i saw things happen of which master broussel ought to be warned and so with monsieur bazin s permission you know mother monsieur bazin the verger i came to speak to monsieur broussel and what hast thou to say boy to monsieur broussel i wish to tell him replied friquet screaming with all his might that there is a whole regiment of guards coming this way				889.5334375315927
you would be no longer a lost child found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the night				894.8431954848486
she thanked them both with a smile				575.7534391510644
it was time for the jailer was coming				7185.571674989182
raoul then approached them as athos had directed him to do				1277.310017431802
i have an inventive mind before that is expired some idea will occur to me				90.4824618480562
he was standing his arms folded near rita who was still insensible				9636.581648472322
he shall go thither and at his return you will send him to me				81.37940556893003
no god forbid said the cardinal only at what hour was he with you oh as to that i can speak positively your eminence for as he came in i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock although i had believed it to be later at what hour did he leave your hôtel at half past ten an hour after the event well replied the cardinal who could not for an instant suspect the loyalty of tréville and who felt that the victory was escaping him well but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs is one friend forbidden to visit another or a musketeer of my company to fraternize with a guard of dessessart s company yes when the house where he fraternizes is suspected that house is suspected tréville said the king perhaps you did not know it indeed sire i did not				653.9137636762457
the approach was not such as to prepossess people an ill smelling dark passage a staircase half lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer from a neighboring yard on the first floor a low door studded with enormous nails like the principal gate of the grand châtelet				1140022.950666406
the two friends approached winter who with his head on his hands was gazing at the heavens he did not hear them enter and remained in the same attitude till he felt a hand upon his shoulder				819.5989193122913
then i have my mode of dispensing justice silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no one sees				1828138.761574238
come sir he said lend me twenty francs you will soon be paid you run no risks with me				72.30331370207556
yes there is the sky here is the sea				626.2315267801797
i shall see everything and at the least suspicious sign i shall begin to exterminate bravo thought d artagnan on this side i think the cardinal will be well guarded he pressed the hand of the lord of pierrefonds and went in search of athos				152.75732566365355
they had just finished their double prayer when a nun softly tapped at the door of the cell				1518.6307484401375
the heart breaks when after having been elated by flattering hopes it sees all its illusions destroyed				7456.237586562552
he waited ten minutes a quarter of an hour half an hour no change took place				578.9588053167009
i hope these gentlemen have theirs i will inquire said morrel				156.01163261428474
ah said the doctor is it you yes said villefort closing the door after him it is i who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone				1000.5266627871372
i think you hailed me mademoiselle julie said he				18.948070911036176
i doubt it				59.951585647746825
the young man having dismissed the boy and horse knocked at the door of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance				3866.353083659197

now as we are wont to complete ourselves each by all the rest and to depend on one another for assistance as one calls his other hand to aid the first i looked around instinctively to see if porthos was there for i had seen you aramis with the king and you count i knew would be under the scaffold and for that reason i forgive you he added offering athos his hand for you must have suffered much				1449.2672489337438

on the day after the morrow by eleven o clock the two diamond studs were finished and they were so completely imitated so perfectly alike that buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was				1901.275192819255
in the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance an enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show themselves				4805.434879249269
then as she had done the evening before she fell on her knees and repeated her prayers aloud				7511.521961860643
athos was right				800.5003189275876
all right and he retired into his room without even asking the cause of so much noise				5639.654087225957

have me arrested on the part of the queen said he and i i will appeal to his eminence at once mme				219.92083298679336
there was a moment of silence during which the two men looked at each other as if to make a preliminary acquaintance after which d artagnan bowed as a sign that he listened				6251.374989903713
she is gone said he she must have returned to the louvre you are sure replied the stranger that she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out no replied bonacieux with a self sufficient air she is too superficial a woman is the young guardsman at home i do not think he is as you see his shutter is closed and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters all the same it is well to be certain how so by knocking at his door				142.40273027279855

monsieur he continued addressing raoul if you are not too tired follow me to the end of the world my lord cried raoul feeling an unknown enthusiasm for that young general who seemed to him so worthy of his renown				42642.60907049765
there all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant agony came back with double force				3714.9851756340645
ah good morning my dear count said he				11.264867312661565
in two seconds the young man had reached his room and burnt caderousse s letter				586.3381077164515
albert could not see the face of the countess as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head and which fell over her features in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her voice had altered				524808.0267027715
the poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy besides the name of the comtesse de winter which she had heard the abbess pronounce was wholly unknown to her and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so fatal a share in the misfortune of her life				571.4085637114192

villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to others				1089.4255510759444
monte cristo was beginning to think what he had not for a long time dared to believe that there were two mercédès in the world and he might yet be happy				8813.50639793931
at last his patience was exhausted				5660.42055462687
d artagnan mounted the box having a pair of pistols in his belt a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him				36.99943150647434
he was carried home in the arms of the people				1424.4490878052886

until then he had been sustained by rage by his strength of mind by despair by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods				897627.9466999418
as for eugénie she was as strong as a judith or a delilah				1182297.6187091838
the king replied that the words spoken in that interview had borne their fruit and that he desired another under the same conditions				9008.085809736325
milady saw the trouble				6053.593865637566

luigi arrived first				806.3641184768019
while he was endeavoring to calm his fears and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious dreams was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in fear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept the noise of a carriage sounded in the yard then he heard the steps of an aged person ascending the stairs followed by tears and lamentations such as servants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in their master s grief				999.1626438178665
how does he come by his name his fortune				1164.1514085694928
it was at this moment d artagnan entered the courtyard of the palace in the coadjutor s carriage and a few seconds later the carriages of the ladies in waiting drove out and the gates were shut after them				111.14280506150209
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped his energetic mind slumbered as the body does after extreme fatigue				2780.66844258749
but his piercing eyes could by no means penetrate the sombre depths of cromwell s				886.5350071106391
d artagnan gave up his bed to any one who wanted it making it over about a dozen times and since he was supposed to have paid like the others a louis for his truss of straw he pocketed in that way thirty louis in less than half an hour				1358.2081142592049
now that an explanation may bear fruit it is necessary that it should be quietly conducted far from noise and interruption				82252.78814958868

grimaud s first intention had been to return to paris but he remembered the anxiety which his prolonged absence might occasion raoul and reflecting that there were now only two miles between the vicomte and himself and a quarter of an hour s riding would unite them and that the going returning and explanation would not occupy an hour he put spurs to his horse and a few minutes after had reached the only inn of mazingarbe				108300.25756913656
nearly four years had passed away at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of time				697.1990702329357

planchet very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord thought he would make all ready like an intelligent man and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master s guests named fourreau and the false soldier who had tried to kill d artagnan and who belonging to no corps had entered into the service of d artagnan or rather of planchet after d artagnan had saved his life				570.334684520483

he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his pocket read the examination and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated april in which morrel by the deputy procureur s advice exaggerated with the best intentions for napoleon was then on the throne the services dantès had rendered to the imperial cause services which villefort s certificates rendered indisputable				1181558.192400785
it was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother unwilling to part from her son and yet aware that a young man of the viscount s age required the full exercise of his liberty had chosen this habitation for albert				345.0566185022457
the delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel but this dantès declined with many thanks saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed s head the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself				193.7343857398935
are you quite alone inquired the guest as caderousse placed before him the bottle of wine and a glass				1013.1115456944073
at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an instant all were on the alert				21327.25289654609
how can it be effected someone must be sent to the duke but who who				1385260.0335974207
don t ask me for counsel don t tell me you are perplexed what to do				1293.876000604456
a woman could go up a ladder like that aramis s searching look seemed to seek his friend s thought even at the bottom of his heart but d artagnan sustained the inquisition with an air of admirable simplicity				158043.0931626136
the cardinal then was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him				33.70086575694476
his first look was certainly directed towards monte cristo but the second was for andrea				1813.3385338838489
we will explain in a few words how d artagnan had been led to choose that place of residence				14808.770590005965
porthos followed chatting with aramis				159.4831883873402
every transport of a daughter finding a father all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by haydée during the first moments of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected				5524.742929825722
i consult them when doubtful and if i ever do any good it is due to their beneficent counsels				613950.8145663254
in short she had taken the measure of motives hitherto unknown to herself through this experiment made upon the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to her study				2220.2216671435226
the noise had ceased but it seemed that morrel expected something something had occasioned the noise and something must follow				10158.834645239862
adieu chevalier adieu countess commend me to the cardinal commend me to satan milady and rochefort exchanged a smile and separated				17884.827247126024
nothing replied bonacieux nothing				578.769728883787
i have discovered a sort of subterranean passage which runs beneath the street and we shall only have to raise one of the marble slabs before the door to open you an entrance and an outlet oh answered another voice which d artagnan instantly recognized as that of aramis				192.76020452766167
this amusement lasted from the barriere des sergens to the place of notre dame and friquet found in it very real enjoyment but when at last the regiment separated penetrated the heart of the city and placed itself at the extremity of the rue saint christophe near the rue cocatrix in which broussel lived then friquet remembered that he had not had breakfast and after thinking in which direction he had better turn his steps in order to accomplish this important act of the day he reflected deeply and decided that councillor broussel should bear the cost of this repast				41844.55488142358
if i bore my proper title i should be a lord				278.43236802431375
she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this unfolded object				11361.416348142711
i am in his majesty s guards monseigneur and i have no reason to be dissatisfied but it appears to me that my guards mine are also his majesty s guards and whoever serves in a french corps serves the king monseigneur your eminence has ill understood my words you want a pretext do you not				684.9559792277672
the knife fell to the ground				683.4789993182691
on the same day the treaty of paris was signed and it was everywhere announced that the cardinal had shut himself up for three days in order to draw it up with the greatest care				1880.1293912733915
the same day the young man set forward on his journey furnished with the three paternal gifts which consisted as we have said of fifteen crowns the horse and the letter for m de tréville the counsels being thrown into the bargain				24800.780644059836
why you are squeezing that letter into your pocket yes said d artagnan athos is right it must be burned				1037309.9984689284
but is not your eminence going to the queen for what purpose monsieur de guitant my uncle has just told me that her majesty had received news of the army it is well i will go comminges had seen rightly and mordaunt had really acted as he had related				1000086.0262411418
it is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it				95.36231389536528
d artagnan and planchet had hardly turned the corner when porthos recognized them				107.15990180070959
at this moment villefort returned				809.3561010800731
ah yes said the count that was the reason of your running away from us yes how is king otho getting on asked albert in the most sprightly tone				497.7905115171461
the trial at eight o clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchamp s door				177.7503197494942
it is now three years madame since i saw you for the first time and during those three years i have loved you thus				3499.8945857335993
this was an awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were waiting				1010.0374912410447
the soldiers you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward				78146.92422763794
after being the instrument of human justice i aspired to be that of the justice of god but let me see how was it done				1462.9704758690793
the idea of asking how i hear the news he said				290.01478040058555
there are hours which last a year				1444.6658600882997
nothing replied grimaud				357.6595124940601
i see thee cast expressive glances at the remains of my supper yes sir for all i ve had since yesterday was a slice of bread and butter with preserves on it				88.73673074268905
oh cried edmond to think that in half an hour i could join her did i not fear being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles				2532.4142294557246
for stealing for stealing				2165358.7685637968
sire resumed tréville as i told you monsieur d artagnan is little more than a boy and as he has not the honor of being a musketeer he was dressed as a citizen				140658.16014095015
i imitate neither manfred nor anthony but without words protestations or vows my life has entwined itself with yours you leave me and you are right in doing so i repeat it you are right but in losing you i lose my life				566.232085813532
in two hours time said he these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs				1139491.4286254323
let me conduct your business and my own				1062.5081844277904
you are doubtless provided with pistols gentlemen				1073.7365593659333
it appears that he had met with disagreeableness likewise on his journey				2245.4580063526805
it would quite cut me up you are a very odd man athos he replied to doubt me thus				3653.2239325942132
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us but said the envoy you do not go about it in the right way to kill him if i understand you correctly aw said the englishman i practice shooting every day and every other day grisier comes to my house this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know				910.9477580774361
it is done monsieur she said with a rattling noise which seemed to tear her throat				2589.893771472715
mademoiselle paulet had already gone mademoiselle de scudery was going				2076.505190388052
tomorrow morning d artagnan sprang from his horse threw the bridle to planchet and departed at a quick pace folding his cloak around him				35.04464232043952
if you will only agree to my request i promise you never to mention another word about escaping the abbé smiled				470.2217730984464
i heard you cry out without understanding what you said				250.34704350825794
haydée chapter				142.7602117437845
all was over carriages horses guards and perhaps even the prisoner were about to be torn to shreds when all at once a voice well known to raoul was heard and suddenly a great sword glittered in the air at the same time the crowd opened upset trodden down and an officer of the musketeers striking and cutting right and left rushed up to raoul and took him in his arms just as he was about to fall				4909.091370449625
are they both dead asked lord de winter sternly				144859.301956807
pity me				37.43641701339357
in fact d artagnan believed that he might be tranquil as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests				13206.045857106974
i will go to the queen and louis xiii opening the door of communication passed into the corridor which led from his apartments to those of anne of austria				2321.6720478282855
he sighed and whispered a name and the head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair a head like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him				37.116331097184535
what sort of a man is he ask the vicomte de morcerf you hear m de morcerf i am referred to you said the countess				4474.943685239201
eh give it to me said the young man				119.01393751348326
precisely what i was about to say cried danglars				238.378509636866
it was therefore at the third door that those who solicited or were bidden to an audience underwent their formal interrogatory				154159.72426613787
mordaunt put his foot on the first step of the door and with his hat in hand prepared to pass by the two friends motioning to the four men to follow him				38.16330881360791
i have already had the honor of telling you i was said morrel				204.39707431050772
do not lie my angel said d artagnan smiling that would be useless what do you mean				6432.602774986453
and why have you such an air of sadness aboard a great misfortune m morrel replied the young man a great misfortune for me especially				2581961.709373816
the count filled one glass but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid				1554132.0256513853
it is he cried bonacieux				4731.303496471262
we have made a wager a wager which could not have been foreseen and of which i defy anyone to divine the true cause				2504.1689549855764
well conceal me somewhere you can say you were needlessly alarmed you can turn their suspicions and save my life the two ladies pressing closely to one another and drawing the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating voice repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds				32073.268277673425
emmanuel received him this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face for every new face might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to question the head of the house				513.2326914853862
upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and nothing to live upon				3947.245065702955
it seems like a woman				436.6517186209502
de guiche might have been about eighteen years of age but he was scarcely taller than raoul who was only fifteen				838504.0857905301
milady not seeing me come again would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits and might suspect something who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go oh my god said kitty you know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right				883.9853741534922
who are you sir he asked that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death				652.5043427953809
has not your excellency heard that the french chargé d affaires was robbed six months ago within five hundred paces of velletri oh yes i heard that well then if like us your excellency lived at leghorn you would hear from time to time that a little merchant vessel or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at porto ferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived no one knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a rock and foundered				820173.6977558135
we still have five minutes replied mousqueton				2633.520171053896
such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable companions				1513.550013602654
a few moments passed a great noise was heard at the gate				1164.040946791241
no said villefort fetch the nearest the nearest said the district doctor is a good italian abbé who lives next door to you				68.56931914848795
i will set before him the example of madame de morcerf and her son what example they gave all their fortune to the hospitals what fortune their own m				716.6631616870887
i neither hate nor blame the cardinal and your opinions will be held ever sacred by me				93.91712626043476
now this rock it has met has been a long and narrow boat manned by six or eight men who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy night near some desert and gloomy island as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a forest but asked franz who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the boat why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments why said gaetano with a smile				545.5154402392632
the stranger then perceiving that the matter went beyond raillery drew his sword saluted his adversary and seriously placed himself on guard				1027.021068793308
friend said he for athos this is too much for the comte de la fère it is too little				1027.002949246259
had stolen away this child in order that your name might become extinct that is reasonable since he is an only son well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten				1605.5096094941846
the young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor s emotion and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features but they felt the sacredness of his grief and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone				967.0926290655227
at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes and porthos started				1779.6446817180224
on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full that there was no room for him at the hôtel de londres				106743.3058499455
grief had made her blind to all but one object that was edmond				1481.4102412030225
his speech therefore was so well turned that in spite of the great wish felt by the courtiers to laugh they could find no point on which to vent their ridicule				4331.274728489199
he was therefore instantly recompensed either for his address or for his sensibility whichever it might be termed				1324053.6984359066
i have been the cause of all your misfortunes but why do you pity instead of blaming me				95.75769437947596
again the abbé had been obliged to swallow a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower him				34.25561289551128
she revives cried the young man				137.80424710898967
true they could send for the headsman of the nearest town but at least a day would be gained and a day might be sufficient for the rescue				128942.6772717392
oh feel for me who could offer millions to that poor woman but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day i was torn from her i loved				5839.333042907809
i made inquiries and found that the house in the champs élysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up				1315.0840827060756
they placed themselves on guard the stranger made a feint and a lunge and that so rapidly that when monsieur porthos came to the parade he had already three inches of steel in his breast				1340.9380269020426
it is not fernand mondego s treachery towards ali pasha which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman fernand towards you and the almost unheard of miseries which were its consequences and i say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my father and i his son thank you for not using greater severity had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected scene it would not have surprised them more than did albert s declaration				752152.941229569
franz now listened to it for the third time yet its notes so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and passions thrilled through the soul of franz with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it				92.94524490186777
tis well resumed the king				467.86777782302215
d artagnan raised himself on tiptoe and as the carriage passed saw harrison at one window and mordaunt at the other				399.9719900599122
that man made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his countenance the englishman smiled imperceptibly				15205.053020638095
would you like to hear the story sir yes relate it said monte cristo pressing his hand to his heart to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own history				8986.03453918138
reflect then wretched man and repent no said caderousse no i will not repent				155175.5707658229
i have nothing to do with these things why hold me responsible yes said porthos				122.9396016811255
in politics my dear fellow you know as well as i do there are no men but ideas no feelings but interests in politics we do not kill a man we only remove an obstacle that is all				182.83573436659393
we must first extract the steel from the side said he shaking his head in a significant manner				781.0877086899138
whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not sound the acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched he was tonight like everybody else				2218.177231150081
m de tréville scolded his musketeers in public and congratulated them in private but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king m de tréville hastened to report himself at the louvre				3093.7963180408215
yes sire yes it is the same and your majesty has a good memory come how shall we decide said the king				503.55793041710194
louis xiii				762.2051055058229
in an instant from the door of the cabinet to the street gate the whole hôtel was boiling				26191.92220292908
absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast radiance but his father a sun pluribus impar left his personal splendor to each of his favorites his individual value to each of his courtiers				15364.21306256542
look look doctor said villefort he is quite coming round again i really do not think after all it is anything of consequence m d avrigny answered by a melancholy smile				534.0581368403224
there s one just arrived and she handed the letter to d artagnan				74.1791615241903
from whom comes this letter from her majesty as i think from her majesty said buckingham becoming so pale that d artagnan feared he would faint as he broke the seal				5596.6999230597385
he only added that on his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent horses one for himself and one for each of his companions then he informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in the stable of the tavern				1164577.3680199448
the count never plays he only drinks pure water tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he can not without intending to laugh at me try to borrow money				1056.8942599037823
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so everything answered franz your voice your look your pallid complexion and even the life you lead i i live the happiest life possible the real life of a pasha				99117.54013088162
the morrel family chapter				223.14220471047034
they called upon him then to retire but he answered that he was a musketeer at heart entirely devoted to your majesty and that therefore he would remain with messieurs the musketeers brave young man murmured the king				530.5670208094785
not more than five or six hundred thousand francs said lord wilmore he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no other reproach to bring on the count accused him of avarice				54389.83568773873
besides he is an englishman				1134.3059933157942
the name of sinbad the sailor as may well be supposed awakened in him a world of recollections as had the name of the count of monte cristo on the previous evening				587.8789800856296
then he added with a certain uneasiness did you meet them why yes i think so in the street said athos and he looked smilingly at aramis who looked at him with an expression of surprise				2078.592495000851
must i take anything with me money if you have any yes fortunately they have left me all i had so much the better for i have expended all mine in chartering a vessel here said milady placing a bag full of louis in felton s hands				473.0628830959839
the mandaïa never fails never trembles never strikes thirty times ineffectually like the soldier who beheaded the count of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer				129201.17160187972
are you not rather young m andrea to think of marrying i think not sir replied m cavalcanti in italy the nobility generally marry young				3275.8095135690205
those born to wealth and who have the means of gratifying every wish said emmanuel know not what is the real happiness of life just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather monte cristo rose and without making any answer for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion walked up and down the apartment with a slow step				1503.1914559270278
yes indeed said he i believe so so that you could without trouble convert these tongs into a hoop and yonder shovel into a corkscrew certainly and the giant took up these two articles and without any apparent effort produced in them the metamorphoses suggested by his companion				966.5901108553345
no aramis replied				11358.859554409893
he certainly likes the child but will he love me less as his affection grows for her and athos confessed to himself that he was unprepared for so prompt a departure but raoul was so happy that this reflection effaced everything else from the consideration of his guardian				101728.97457285791
how were you to blame in that affair listen when one bears an irreproachable name as i do one is rather sensitive everybody pities you sir and above all mademoiselle danglars poor eugénie said danglars do you know she is going to embrace a religious life no alas it is unhappily but too true				1072.9811169470142
bonacieux raising her hands to her forehead i shall go mad stop what i hear a horse s steps it is my brother setting off again				272.0548665717483
are you one of us monsieur de rochefort i am very desirous of being so my lord but i am totally in the dark about everything				841.0299291017651
d artagnan s plan was very simple				28708.810345756123
peste that s a fine age replied porthos				10.633542943214623
oh yes				1633.6241530231487
wait quietly then in two hours in four in six hours at latest planchet will be here				1220.1575021190545
he had found himself so strictly guarded that he soon perceived the fruitlessness of any attempt at escape				4354.343528429544
like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse				746612.1540825542
i remember well that diamond which belonged to the queen you see then that i speak to you in the queen s name				761.7607385323186
the expression of the count s face had not remained unperceived by the banker he fixed on him a look of greater assurance than before and said you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count and making a violent effort over himself he said i have a right to insist on your giving me an explanation				1434.955944728843
at the door he stopped to listen				1673.2817472140534
bonacieux in a tone of reproach ah monsieur i had your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman				810.7037352680751
if the abbé busoni should by any accident return think of me in another week you will have left beaucaire remarked caderousse for the fair ends in a few days true but that makes no difference				27103.06850186731
where do you keep your wine no no thanks				3320.3271742487746
another motive had influenced albert s selection of his seat who knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in truth attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage or a place in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival				194917.9717176854
during the reading of this which was long the public attention was continually drawn towards andrea who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern				622509.7609271625
the duke glanced at the clock				1080.2179631887855
it is true they might have taken others but there was a great forest to pass through and planchet as we have seen had no liking for forests after dark				7606.228692613512
oh we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you answered la carconte with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to guests who paid for what they took				98411.6886999157

morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son of whose arrival he was ignorant				8433.366547368516

oh had he been my own son replied bertuccio or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the right road for the knowledge that you are doing your duty gives you strength but the idea that i was striking a child whose father i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him				28.811840697773473

the young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest patience turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again rummaging and rerummaging in his valise and opening and reopening his purse but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the letter was not to be found he flew for the third time into such a rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine oil and rosemary for upon seeing this hot headed youth become exasperated and threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were not found the host seized a spit his wife a broom handle and the servants the same sticks they had used the day before				871.2408342348583

a light cloud passed over the count s face				650.2003959006904
edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow who had been one of his own sailors as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance				1650.7754013650012
danglars who thought himself threatened certain consciences are never calm danglars even before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror				1187.056765206765
but when it was necessary to convey the prisoner from one carriage to the other the people catching sight of him whom they called their liberator uttered every imaginable cry and knotted themselves once more around the vehicle				807807.7624848011
still as five o clock approached and the carriage was momentarily expected by the count the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his manner				760.8535528195413
if the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in france				562.3016235082015
we will not go till evening this very much astonished the sailors although not one opposed it				88.83999211292516
but by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared and she remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose				1905.7654303484471
with a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest details				8423.640511164438
all were fully engrossed with the affairs of the day athos could not therefore have chosen a more inauspicious moment to speak of his friends poor atoms lost in that raging whirlwind				145847.37971534402
caderousse terrified looked at the count				309.1629854795761

as these ornaments were given by the king the minister persuaded his majesty to insist upon the queen s appearing in them as part of her jewels at a ball which was soon to take place				592.8017575214903
the old man looked at her with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed to receive her				206.55020742249548
when he was only eleven he chose his companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several times threatened with a prosecution				1217571.8613386017
m morrel had not readily given up the fight				3520.310899163626
at length they arrived at the famous room				194.52176364077812
what do you want with me said she and why do you place your hand on me i thought that madame was ill and i wished to bring her help responded the maid frightened at the terrible expression which had come over her mistress s face				618.357520907212
why here they give you their hand they press yours in return they keep up a whispering conversation permit you to accompany them home				1423.9777799963615
have you any money the four friends looked at one another and a cloud came over the brows which but lately had been so cheerful				130676.41490052929
the face of the steward despite one slight shade of care light as a summer cloud seemed a physiognomy of absolute felicity				1021281.5645077683
there were large bottles filled with serpents ticketed according to their species dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs doubtless possessed of virtues unknown to common men were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the corners of the apartment				609.2519676639931

the little old man remained at the coach door the coachman took care of his horses the lackey held the saddlehorses				87758.60503392889
the carriage however passed on				925.4510660511497
the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on				1132.7547315891752
dantès strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak				26359.94008433542
haydée looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of monte cristo s voice had awakened her from a dream and she resumed her narrative				8870.213115476394
let us go on				722.1486793492553

no one has seen d artagnan and porthos has not appeared				1140.425723972251
no but it will be said caderousse as surely as dantès will be captain of the pharaon eh danglars danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to caderousse whose countenance he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness				1960794.1550874794
if you like replied the latter				6218.244080001801

his visits were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his time but generally both in summer and winter he took possession of his apartment about four o clock though he never spent the night there				799.2355743795097
one thing only puzzles me namely how franz d épinay will like a grandfather who can not be separated from his wife				1294.8474730003957
my dear mother said he do you know if m de morcerf has any enemy mercédès started she noticed that the young man did not say my father my son she said persons in the count s situation have many secret enemies				1064.7235089912378
he preserved this opinion even after the feast with the remnants of which he repaired his own long abstinence but when in the evening he made his master s bed the chimeras of planchet faded away				1058.215477152298
vampa when this man is satisfied let him be free danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew when he raised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow before which the bandits bowed				1327.7395092351792
strength and sagacity				916904.692626155

the carriage pursued its way still going at a great pace till it dashed into paris and disappeared				604.7566612100555
if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them said monte cristo				266.77249521955036
so my dear viscount whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said morcerf				711.9641053720742
if you want anything you can ring oh my god my god				441.97076789059344
king s attorney said the president stupefied and without noticing the agitation which spread over the face of m de villefort king s attorney yes and if you wish to know his name i will tell it he is named villefort the explosion which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to the court of justice now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience				4354.43903986556
when the te deum was over the coadjutor without stopping to change his priestly dress took his way toward that old tower which he knew so well				509.9088319480376
but i swear to you sir i swear to you by everything a man holds dear i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate there was a brief silence during which the fixed searching eye of the abbé was employed in scrutinizing the agitated features of the innkeeper				43343.18141380631
we are alone sir said buckingham speak my lord said felton the baron de winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named charlotte backson yes sir and i answered him to bring or send me that order and i would sign it here it is my lord give it to me said the duke				620.8425333633871
you know that even now the king is but a child and the queen a woman weak enough				871.5391712251426
it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing sight to see them die for when dying they change color three or four times and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen				5489.512591697225
i too said porthos who faithful to the instructions still held the cardinal s arm				1255.079223260488
if i stay in paris i can not go to rome if i became pope i could not continue to be prime minister and it is only by continuing prime minister that i can make monsieur d artagnan a captain and monsieur du vallon a baron true said aramis so as i am in a minority i withdraw my proposition so far as it relates to the voyage to rome and monseigneur s resignation i am to remain minister then said mazarin				454.7043842695495
yes you will receive it from your father personally but lord wilmore will be the security for the money				1019.1278580448568
a rich uniform half french half oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the order of the legion of honor				1460.0943170338674
the latter seemed to be maturing in her mind some great stroke a fact which increased the uneasiness of the cardinal who knew the proud princess and dreaded much the determination of anne of austria				2267.596447097757
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the staircase of the ground floor and not from a window in monte cristo s opinion the villains sought his life not his money				1038.9850709715834
from the former she took some greasy letters and put in their place the bank notes and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire fortune of the miserable couple				76805.31784760121
breathe not a word of that or the comte de la fere will be furious you think the count will be angry with me think it				83.38374038904227
they had told him to hope for it but had not told him what was to be hidden in the mysterious pate				873749.2095864987
the stone had been brought with the evident intention of barricading the road but some one having perceived the obstacle had partially turned it aside				3453.575321424598
at the sight of carlini cucumetto rose a pistol in each hand				199.05591741378868
stop said the englishman i have the key of that door and he opened the door with a trembling hand into the second compartment where mousqueton and blaisois were preparing supper				4456.247914092492
it seemed to him that if porthos and aramis deemed him superior to them in the arts of diplomacy they would like him all the better for it but that athos on the contrary would despise him				36.653104337023215
bonaparte m dandré looked at louis xviii who employed in writing a note did not even raise his head				379.12183881581655
he then went straight to the door and knocked murmuring i will go myself and be caught in the mousetrap but woe be to the cats that shall pounce upon such a mouse the knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before the tumult ceased steps approached the door was opened and d artagnan sword in hand rushed into the rooms of m bonacieux the door of which doubtless acted upon by a spring closed after him				35.84409395074751
albert sprang from the porter s lodge to the steps				1649.1169206184823
shot my dear boy				6269.453337027657
then said the coadjutor this evening at ten o clock and if i am pleased with you another bag of five hundred pistoles will be at your disposal the eyes of the mendicant dashed with cupidity but he quickly suppressed his emotion				2647.820526898529
let us send in our names and if he does not send us a suitable message we will leave him to his own affairs or those of france				553.1577984001541
leave the saucepan said dantès you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast this advice was to the jailer s taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip				191731.23077921613
albert who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the table and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros				1080678.6537487155
on perceiving the count he rose quickly				1543.9799427937462
there was no great cunning necessary				3971.747906414965
gentlemen said the count seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit				1989650.3289448638
the words that parry had read assured them that their presence was understood by the king and was assigned to its real motive				52786.464679274985
external existence then resembles a sleep of which this thought is the dream				1448.8789227326079
this silence self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the count raised his pallid face				623.1194034052543
i am too much indebted to you to refuse your first request				30748.990456616943
when porthos had left him to give some orders he saw mousqueton approaching				6339.727010092352
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness at these words there appeared in noirtier s eye an expression of such deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words there you are mistaken i can still do much for you do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said valentine				651.0501494562498
well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation				1329472.971299977
the soldier replied by pointing out to him an officer who was conversing on foot his hand upon the neck of a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat				49850.885295698085
jesu cried planchet can it be at this exclamation the man on horseback turned slowly and with a lofty air and the two travelers could see displayed in all their brilliancy the large eyes the vermilion visage and the eloquent smile of mousqueton				1536.750972737906
by my soul said aramis she is charming				9770.019174071134
d artagnan could not help perceiving that something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and said well monsieur planchet what is the matter with us now don t you think monsieur that woods are like churches how so planchet because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other but why did you not dare to speak aloud planchet because you are afraid afraid of being heard				724.8468478420092
he told me let me think what was it				77.7535520253641
chapter lxvi				18868.374644859956
you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble what can you mean asked madame danglars shuddering				4922.799690510987
the valet re entered				641.0809567065704
we will send the carriage to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some orders i have given have been executed excellency said a servant opening the door a man in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you ah				559.4962680652001
it is well for albert he is not in the army said morrel				221.51531171501023
i believe these fellows have managed their business				2419.0774077864617
go edward and see because they are looking for her where she is not to be found and where are they looking for her with grandpapa noirtier and do you think she is not there no no no no no she is not there replied edward singing his words				718.143360933709
there said la carconte as she placed a bottle of wine on the table supper is ready whenever you are and you asked joannes				1310268.911990232
you will go to marseilles said dantès for you understand i repeat his words just as he uttered them				89.79600386587651
madame de villefort fell at her husband s feet				838.4772171827559
yes sir replied mousqueton				2197.360381946123
the abbé s chamber after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two friends reached the further end of the corridor into which the abbé s cell opened from that point the passage became much narrower and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees				1524.9642088770026
so much the better				832.8213749597867
i once possessed four dear and faithful friends besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss				13312.910063126017
a man was hidden in lafitte s banking house behind one of the little arched windows which are placed above each desk he saw mercédès enter the diligence and he also saw albert withdraw				6033.450270825347
ah ha cried danglars this fellow is more like an ogre than anything else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating we see that danglars was collected enough to jest at the same time as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the man took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously				1243548.6818964828
but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of danger that is well understood and in that case how shall i know where you are you do not want your lackey is he a sure man to the proof give him to me				98.40712750940251
he wished to call out to him but could not utter a word				477.8319355270349
this evening said the governor when the task was ended				4436.910860744296
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them				103.92823362801401
as happy as possible and yet sir you may make me even happier than i am well speak if it depends on me oh sir				737.299336543342
at a distance of hardly a quarter of a league they looked down on lens at bay and before lens the enemy s entire army				2064.628711446134
a door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black silently advanced and stood behind the chair on which mazarin sat				49087.84887317126
at madame de villefort s proposition he instantly winked his eyes				575.2644155386502
he again took in his strong arms the little girl whose pretty golden head and smiling face rested on his shoulder and placed her gently in the carriage then jumping on his horse with the elegance of a first rate esquire after bowing to athos and d artagnan he went off close by the door of the carriage on somebody inside of which his eyes were riveted				1178820.9375567145
on the contrary be off and quickly				1557.2096104719833
you may retire we consent to that				690.169511862789
the young man heard these words and bent so forward over the rock that one might have supposed he was about to precipitate himself from it				87.5995148153588
de saint méran said madame de villefort then this house belonged to m de saint méran before you bought it it appears so replied monte cristo				333.9778701461435
as to the duc de bouillon he had such a fit of gout as obliged him to return to paris in a litter but his place was well filled by the duc d elbeuf and his four sons ranged around him like a staff				4664.005599408387
this is the matter be he ever so cunning he shall never say i was his dupe				1086094.6665556398
you asked the name of that young lady				1793.9798156682823
then you know him almost screamed the countess				4012.051981361083
since the death of madame de saint méran i have known that a poisoner lived in my house				507.61629516938615
not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere				13936.80944199639
she was charming				15898.374174782475
in the avenue des champs élysées that the count of monte cristo lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the gate after him and began to ascend the steps				1727.6137216564714
albert however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation				1519376.2166433043
if mousqueton were here				935.5655731522908
you need not look for it i do not want it said the old man				96.92693461132127
linen and wine are both being warmed come the young men had no objection to this proposition on the contrary they thought it very timely				1377034.3649149651
yes athos i know what you mean we shall do very well at the parpaillot let us go to the parpaillot then for here the walls are like sheets of paper d artagnan who was accustomed to his friend s manner of acting and who perceived immediately by a word a gesture or a sign from him that the circumstances were serious took athos s arm and went out without saying anything				2481.07511168471
vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the residence of madame de villefort with the design of renewing their visit at the right moment of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure				3396.3025016189004
but do you think asked albert that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect stranger what sort of person is this count of monte cristo asked franz of his host				592.6576133974143
madame you are deceived said porthos she is simply a duchess and that running footman who waited at the door and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage but with the eye of a jealous woman mme				193.9974769969877
when they were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general of his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged to which he made no opposition				23562.267717212293
but now that the duke had escaped the concierge had seen fit to fasten the gate with a double lock				94728.01173646211
he pushed open the door and found the first room empty and deserted				4893.997496025783
then he took milady in his arms and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the patrol had taken				1864.1624993142107
yes i have said it and i now repeat it our destinies are irrevocably united although we now pursue divergent roads				95950.17449794833
i thought as much said d artagnan wasting his strength in useless efforts				8816.27214743856
you too then are unhappy she said				319.66358135675705
i must divert my attention amuse yourself with milady my dear d artagnan i wish you may with all my heart if that will amuse you hear me athos said d artagnan				66.16433244304245
then they saw as the felucca turned two other heads peeping those of aramis and grimaud				1049.6044433765842
upon my word said she it is very droll and that mad marie michon fared better than she expected				5569.667292329776
this gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with anger				4124.520806507576
are not you the person who brought me a letter inquired franz from the viscount of morcerf your excellency lodges at pastrini s hotel i do your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount i am your excellency s name is the baron franz d épinay then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed is there any answer inquired franz taking the letter from him				31.65019592673708
tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator and muscular as a spartan he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken				1876.9942037594733
you know something about him do you not madame				581.7474478204683
then a singular thing occurred				313728.24391703535
or solitary confinement				102269.52528665667
you might have taken lord winter who tis said was your uncle prisoner but you preferred killing him tis well we that is monsieur du vallon and i could have killed our prisoners we preferred taking them mordaunt s very lips grew white with rage				1469.9869531442039
by force				3441.5418097484453
my name is edmond dantès replied the young man calmly i am mate of the pharaon belonging to messrs morrel son your age continued villefort				332.35505563880304
the person who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable				5635.481998029354
this house was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a crime who said it was a crime asked villefort with a last effort				10912.837853657305
then when we asked them what were their intentions the master replied that he had forty charges to fire and that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar				3894.173379001798
two of her companions were dressed the one as a woman of nettuno and the other as a woman of la riccia				807554.3454081481
make use of it i pray you for your pleasure or your business the young men wished to decline but they could find no good reason for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them				103.14365276050249
what would you have said the musketeer				1012.1376231416655
too long a wait too long but who will say your excellency has been to monte cristo oh i shall not cried franz				749.4205931117939
listen sir				254.87115244622385
stop an instant the name seems certainly familiar				60655.9968243112
in fact he sometimes asked himself if all that was happening to him was not a dream or at least the delirium of a fever				22855.13363670654
this woman is certainly a great liar				2308699.5920209438
my sword is shorter than yours it s true but bah				14011.706389368066
then turning to the baroness may i ask how mademoiselle danglars is said he				161.63789537679529
what did he say some parting words to his friends his friends murmured cromwell				3137.7310624641627
the victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four men				1195.0766844472907
bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life				582.945377936772
these keys were given up to him instantly				3309.6037235906033
tell me i beseech you what ails you cried dantès letting his chisel fall to the floor				1432.7468664288203
it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam				94756.47300786522
the god of fruitfulness in grecian mythology				1462322.6904868323
maximilian shuddered				3084.3456611450424
as he passed them he said they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner indeed your excellency i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the count shrugging his shoulders				865.3516101263734
en route monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal all goes well in this direction d artagnan in the meantime had taken the head of his detachment without a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks the character of an old soldier				3566.8686441341283
there s a carriage coming over yonder then bending again to raoul he whispered above all things do not divulge your name that s right				879.7445794224391
so from that time monsieur continued the latter we have led the most miserable life imaginable for you must know monsieur that all our provisions are in the cellar				3912.465688844502
besides if he will do nothing officially he will answer any questions you propose to him				32.68915530135231
impossible go on go on my dear fellow said d artagnan for upon my honor you will kill me with your indifference we divided then this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles each you are laughing at me and want to try me said d artagnan whom anger began to take by the hair as minerva takes achilles in the iliad				2020202.3327014798
then d artagnan became almost wild				1186965.7512893225
neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual nothing more				1848.7260935980103
valentine hid her head between her hands				489.2539031988856
bravo he said besides we shall be there at the time of the flight				7989.334406179094
the young man pressed his lips on the same spot on the old man s forehead where valentine s had been				5812.242502981851
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him				37.08992556401568
she has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit may obtain his pardon				14092.299990142716
your servants said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful story from them i learned it all but it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here love forgive me replied morrel i will go away no said valentine you might meet someone stay but if anyone should come here the young girl shook her head				372.8189775870843
he is he would have added edmond dantès but the count seized his arm and prevented him				34.833084074428676
he raised himself to glance in the direction which they pointed out saw the monk and fell back upon the litter his face illumined by joy				1128.8142614953172
and as a proof of what i say she commanded me to show you this diamond which she thinks you know and so saying mazarin extended his hand to the officer who sighed as he recognized the ring so gracefully given to him by the queen on the night of the ball at the hotel de ville and which she had repurchased from monsieur des essarts				1891090.8224947017
remember your oath				22156.117262938107
ah traitor cried buckingham you have killed me murder screamed patrick				21465.31322685027
every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest				1024.7527374412243
he was alone again				259.9274083402744
excuse me albert sorrow on your account and delight with that noble girl thus pursuing paternal vengeance				2744.833511012617
besides these a casket of magnificent goldwork with the same arms as the sword and the portrait formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture				5498.629414275254
moreover he reckoned much on the interest of the danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures				941747.2546463233
they were at that part of the quai des ormes where the steps lead down to the river				6695.179483846958
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor dantès carefully preserved it that in the event of his getting out of prison he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a diamond would have quite sufficed to make his fortune then i suppose asked caderousse with eager glowing looks that it was a stone of immense value why everything is relative answered the abbé				432.2404905031195
they can t be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all day and only waking to eat all night				874.2313066784639
besides you forget cæsar an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two cæsar gave way before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner				2134.0710875032464
ridiculous repeated he and the ridicule will fall on me				79.92466009510466
de guiche as we have said before had been educated at the court and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to him				34.46433766080587
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme				163.41702519055605
but d artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship				2393729.2782223937
said the count fixing his eyes on the steward to whom he gave this order				4558.528241866657

then he came back to the point where perhaps he ought to have begun and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned but this proved useless for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession no one answered and some of the neighbors who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise had assured him that that house all the openings of which were tightly closed had not been inhabited for six months				2695.3013339168992
the coadjutor glanced rapidly behind and saw that he was followed by another man				139.02055653164248

your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority great on the subject of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words				708.1597855448489
in the meantime the mousetrap continued in operation and likewise d artagnan s vigilance				1141238.0119754127
thus from fondi to perusia everyone trembles at the name of cucumetto				6503.433607121115
my name must rest unknown replied franz merely say i am a frenchman travelling for pleasure as soon as gaetano had transmitted this answer the sentinel gave an order to one of the men seated round the fire who rose and disappeared among the rocks				659787.7437597213

by an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given d artagnan put his horse into a gallop and in a few strides overtook the carriage but the window was hermetically closed the vision had disappeared				606.9971139330804
i was not deceived said he here is monsieur d artagnan and you are his friends messieurs athos porthos and aramis the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with astonishment				2248.750734058667
how long a start have they two hours and a quarter my officer two hours and a quarter that is nothing we are well mounted are we not porthos porthos breathed a sigh he thought of what was in store for his poor horses				983.0118601194702

good morning lucien good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me				57.40682903838419
what is he going to do thought villefort whose position demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his father s intentions were				6298.3865874352805
come planchet let us pay a visit to the king s treasurer and then set off toward paris sir toward paris and they set out at as hard a canter as their horses could maintain				830905.1751053552
the time and place are but ill suited for an introduction said albert but we are not superstitious				17173.33102896617
i congratulate you my dear m danglars said monte cristo i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of second rate fortunes i think i may aspire to that honor said danglars with a smile which reminded monte cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins				1682863.0851922003

but his majesty s decision is always necessary and i inform you with regret that no one becomes a musketeer without the preliminary ordeal of several campaigns certain brilliant actions or a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours d artagnan bowed without replying feeling his desire to don the musketeer s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which preceded the attainment of it				87.79572236482775
my father s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present time although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married m noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson m de villefort had scarcely said this when the door opened and barrois appeared				1157.6393686502747
the whole of the second story was set apart for maximilian it was precisely similar to his sister s apartments except that for the breakfast parlor he had a billiard room where he received his friends				525.3730900087712
the host insisted but the travelers were firm and he was obliged to do as they wished				12129.787638198477
in his projects of intrigue for the future and determined as he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune d artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them				113.10912079777668

he was right at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard inside				7256.522995769657
then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus one of those chaste figures those calm shadows those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons				1040906.2276200069
if i can get enough to rebuild artagnan which my ancestors impoverished by the crusades allowed to fall into ruins and to buy thirty acres of land about it that is all i wish				1374.9582501159407

if there are two let parry kill one and you the other				391.11691803376004
i really never heard a person speak as you do because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings and you allow then sir that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us why should they not				679.7934988875616
i do not know you for one of us then it is because you do not know your friends my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor raising his hat				2154.1928294513127

here is your chamber for tonight said he				11.209211409209315
you are perhaps ignorant that they are fighting in england added she with a melancholy smile and that in a short time they will fight in a much more decided fashion than they have done hitherto i am completely ignorant of it madame said the cardinal accompanying his words with a slight shrug of the shoulders alas our own wars quite absorb the time and the mind of a poor incapable infirm old minister like me well then your eminence said the queen i must inform you that charles i my husband is on the eve of a decisive engagement				19024.59640250772
planchet was equally seized with admiration and said no more about going away				818.1327211857144
that instant the arm of porthos fell				2708.778315066252
monsieur said the prince turning toward raoul i know that you have a letter from my sister madame de longueville but i see that you have preferred commending yourself to me by giving me good counsel my lord said raoul coloring up i did not wish to interrupt your highness in a conversation so important as that in which you were engaged with the count				253.014617977349

the catalan watched him until caderousse almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his glass upon the table				679.4114325013625

he descended or rather seemed to descend several steps inhaling the fresh and balmy air like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the mind a dreaming and such fires as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to ali the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his eyes like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the chamber of statues lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure				1316.6250957092973
it was to run to meet me that she leaped from that pile of wood there s only one remedy dear raoul that is to marry her as a compensation remarked d artagnan				77.50191891358219
i was only speaking in reference to the second rate fortunes we were mentioning just now and with all this how unassuming he is				1429.826489855735
the two grooms held the horses that they might take a little rest without being unsaddled and grimaud was posted as sentinel				1702.671562745839
aha continued d artagnan it is clear that they are afraid of something or other for look the sentinels are being reinforced				1270014.3109129008
lord winter you are not the king you are my uncle at the same moment mordaunt for it was he leveled his pistol at winter it went off and the ball entered the heart of the old cavalier who with one bound on his saddle fell back into the arms of athos murmuring he is avenged think of my mother shouted mordaunt as his horse plunged and darted off at full gallop				1652.623091006699
there could be no doubt that behind this little window which threw forth such friendly beams the pretty mme				217.83877110186032
and a comforting one too added d artagnan seeing the delight that his intelligence gave the young man				131.22251552631425
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest attention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks				144611.67526762778
but putting his head out of the carriage eh				1871.0535279156863

and would you still cane me if i took it into my head to disobey you				44.71397330231319

madame de saint méran whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament grief could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint méran at any rate said albert whatever disease or doctor may have killed her m de villefort or rather mademoiselle valentine or still rather our friend franz inherits a magnificent fortune amounting i believe to livres per annum and this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin noirtier that is a tenacious old grandfather said beauchamp				717.873913229989
what could that mean				5159.6205381352065
around this opening which had possibly for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings				1837682.8197111893
only think then if mademoiselle danglars instead of being called claire marie eugénie had been named mademoiselle chastity modesty innocence danglars what a fine effect that would have produced on the announcement of her marriage hush said the count do not joke in so loud a tone haydée may hear you perhaps and you think she would be angry no certainly not said the count with a haughty expression				1013.987765162928
yes said he yes that would flatter me very much but i should not have time enough to enjoy the distinction				84260.31059014886

you he said you who are so trusting read and reflect that there is something in this letter important for us to see athos took the letter frowning but an idea that he should find something in this letter about d artagnan conquered his unwillingness to read it				89.14182609044163
his head hanging down his eye dull his speech slow and painful athos would look for hours together at his bottle his glass or at grimaud who accustomed to obey him by signs read in the faint glance of his master his least desire and satisfied it immediately				1202.4097862004676

monsieur d artagnan said the valet de chambre				120849.93401063222

no sir but i am severely what can we do said d artagnan we must return to paris i will take care of mousqueton said grimaud and he gave his arm to his old comrade whose eyes were full of tears nor could grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again				260.1504775453996

i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose masters made them grammarians doctors and philosophers in order that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market monte cristo smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from m andrea cavalcanti				2389.625744137712

d artagnan had already opened the door of the second room and from the expression of his face it was clear that he there beheld some extraordinary object				9981.374313510229
certainly though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover monte cristo had told him when half distracted he had rushed to the count s house that if she were not dead in two hours she would be saved				18720.825631999945
then d artagnan being alone struck a light and lighted a small bit of tinder mounted his horse and stopped at the door in the midst of the soldiers				2337.6674467845114

the examination no sooner had villefort left the salon than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands				549.7465215550894
the frondeurs will have a treaty and your eminence must sign it before us promising at the same time to obtain the queen s consent to it i can answer only for myself said mazarin				506.74493662713576

the carriage which had been stopped for a minute resumed its way passed through the crowd threaded the rue st honoré turned into the rue des bons enfants and stopped before a low door				189.30944110731005
and if i have any counsel to give it is always lose she seemed to love me so she seemed did she oh she did love me you child why there is not a man who has not believed as you do that his mistress loved him and there lives not a man who has not been deceived by his mistress except you athos who never had one that s true said athos after a moment s silence that s true				1058.4561970391342

in his regiment maximilian morrel was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a soldier but also of the duties of a man and he thus gained the name of the stoic we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant				7741.645531705374

ah monsieur said he after having vainly searched on the mantle piece and the shelves i have not got any candles take one of the carriage lamps bertuccio said the count and show me the apartments the steward obeyed in silence but it was easy to see from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled how much it cost him to obey				6010.289173631673
no it will all go well m d épinay if he is an honorable man will consider himself more than ever pledged to mademoiselle de villefort unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice but that is impossible i agree with m de villefort said monte cristo fixing his eyes on madame de villefort and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told m d épinay is coming back to settle this affair at once beyond all possibility of revocation				872537.6393438505

the island was familiar to the crew of la jeune amélie it was one of her regular haunts				596831.3395670764
debray with the air of a man familiar with the house entered first into the court threw his bridle into the hands of a footman and returned to the door to receive madame danglars to whom he offered his arm to conduct her to her apartments				3376.1996658805056
franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows				1412.6874587808716
did you ask for me my good friend said m de tréville				1208.3079605230773
m noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter mademoiselle de villefort it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years and has by her devoted attention fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her grandfather and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion the eye of noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent given by madame de villefort s words and manner to the motives which she supposed him to entertain				73915.52016021922
notwithstanding his commission in the musketeers d artagnan felt completely solitary				207288.9458884138
and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the allées de meilhan was obtained				5479.809867309728

he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation				1178559.0254353627
andrea turned towards them and with an impertinent smile asked have you any message for your father mademoiselle danglars for in all probability i shall return to paris eugénie covered her face with her hands				507.88358906279524
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with gold that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity				9927.45268035405
a few words he let fall showed them that he was no stranger to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with chemistry				1147981.8050422631
at ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative gascon and as he had already perceived that these men were musketeers he did not doubt that the three others were those called the inseparables that is to say athos porthos and aramis				187.5142365248118
then after dinner on the pretext of business he questioned the father and son upon their mode of living and the father and son previously informed that it was through danglars the one was to receive his francs and the other livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken hands even with the banker s servants so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon				3871.8509789539694
grimaud said athos pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall of the bastion take those gentlemen set them up against the wall put their hats upon their heads and their guns in their hands oh the great man cried d artagnan				89.14429148036531
and yet he reckoned and with reason on milady				544.2314306530019
but there as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the jolly miller without anyone host waiter or hostler coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse d artagnan spied though an open window on the ground floor a gentleman well made and of good carriage although of rather a stern countenance talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect				1260.8346839589572
well what do you propose to do she said at length come speak i will go this instant and consult the queen and we will refer the affair at once to parliament with which you are at war is it not so				443.10520302309135
the rock already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base				760105.1682073422

friend cried planchet				324.54105704250543
does not your eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him there will be in all times and in all countries particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs				2256109.2074218667
mazarin marked with surprise the diabolical expression with which the young man uttered these words				722.6360952300477
answer continued milady				281.96091315704905
repeat it cried d artagnan it will make a little change not so for it is religious replied aramis it is theology in verse the devil said d artagnan				74.78762595840858
edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old sailor and his crew tried to pump him they extracted nothing more from him he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first story				2887.2355650222403
she was in tears and strange as it was in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears he looked also at madame de villefort and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had passed over her thin lips like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky				7394.636418862119
the steward entered				694.4223368107888
m de tréville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette when he felt the hand of athos who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain at length overcome by it fell upon the floor as if he were dead				502.215079372429
your grandfather knows then that a poisoner lives here perhaps he even suspects the person				846.4956643038672
d artagnan thought this could not last long and continued to look with all his eyes and listen with all his ears				1854.3235220826075
good god raoul was directing his horse toward the unhappy man in danger				3970.2936751845864
the doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning the subject has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever but remarked madame de villefort all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond ah that is where the art comes in				919.175241541067
the idea of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind and with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before				873.3080195760854
a burning fire a red hot iron the iron of the executioner was imprinted on my shoulder felton uttered a groan				2997.6523664832325

monsieur d artagnan sides with mazarin				455.52296504863165
there were then as now a crowd of young and pretty women who came to st				2217.170520385446
as to the commencement of an intrigue between her and m de wardes our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that although the marquis was young handsome rich and high in the cardinal s favor				1765.0739330488993
then turning toward porthos the devil said he this has a bad look				1625.8707999493529
the squares were broken to shivers and athos like the spectre of vengeance leaped into the room				197.37316362014653
i have nothing to say that can not be said before all juxon sat down and the king kneeling humbly before him began his confession				861615.9712670203
and aramis i have seen him also said d artagnan but he seemed to me cold ah you have seen aramis said athos turning on d artagnan a searching look				1692.4384345293506
yes repeated the count				260.47929207013107
it was now athos s turn to take a sly look				1646.745392292519

well the poison brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors who are generally bad chemists and which will act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom justice learns nothing as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy abbé adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young lady motionless with attention				1143.9658902562328
the comte de wardes was announced and d artagnan was introduced				41462.84900504007
albert sprang out bearing his moccoletto in his hand				210.385450349544
the slave of the count of monte cristo				352.08026551521374
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the position which you had lost and that he would seek your father until he found him				32.49784416459323
an unexpected incident in the affair of murder and theft at the count of monte cristo s in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m de villefort indeed said m danglars in the same tone in which he would have said oh well what do i care as a matter of fact said monte cristo approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence what you count said madame danglars signing if you are take care for i shall never forgive you andrea pricked up his ears				1846.4407891299252
during the daytime valentine s perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant presence of m noirtier who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter s room and watched her with his paternal tenderness villefort also on his return from the law courts frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child				1695.0778237800957
vampa then rushed towards teresa for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy had also wounded his betrothed				1943.6998883179285
and that was policar morrel my uncle who was afterwards a captain				1177.3799050494247
and now raoul said the gascon monsieur du vallon and i are going away as ambassadors where i know not but should you want anything write to madame turquaine at la chevrette rue tiquetonne and draw upon her purse as on a banker with economy for it is not so well filled as that of monsieur d emery and having meantime embraced his ward he passed him into the robust arms of porthos who lifted him up from the ground and held him a moment suspended near the noble heart of the formidable giant				22343.480470770606
let us hope my child cried the marquis that m de villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province if so he will have achieved a noble work and one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father s conduct added the incorrigible marquise				3047.2202299761097
he saw in the young man his natural successor and regretted that he had not a daughter that he might have bound edmond to him by a more secure alliance				30740.575470335134
here he said take this pocket book do you give it to me yes but only on condition that you will not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his boat cried to marseilles then as he departed he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison				1242.9575118611174
they are men who do nothing for nothing you know the only reply that i desire said d artagnan the only one worthy of you and of me and he drew nearer to her				138.72250445015217
i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you yes and by accustoming her to that poison you have endeavored to neutralize the effect of a similar poison noirtier s joy continued				5383.75167274211
the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman				3992.825672914557
to saddle				2502.421430717663
as for the old man his chest heaved with his panting respiration				36846.3932295969
his father went up to him took him in his arms and kissed his forehead				3681.2691163063682
as he passed the hôtel des gardes he took a glance into the stables				93429.15119619349
then he placed the gibbet in the middle of the room bursting with laughter				1206.8229413611405
all these movements had been effected mechanically as far as he was concerned				118595.47211519246
he looked at albert he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not half smoked it				90.37155989969219
and she assumed upon sitting up in the armchair a still more graceful and abandoned position than when she reclined				959436.3516582536
did you ever see anything more perfect than her acting why you know my dear fellow when one has been accustomed to malibran and sontag such singers as these don t make the same impression on you they perhaps do on others at least you must admire moriani s style and execution i never fancied men of his dark ponderous appearance singing with a voice like a woman s my good friend said franz turning to him while albert continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to please the curtain at length fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of morcerf who seized his hat rapidly passed his fingers through his hair arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way				876.3933414443871
presently a good solid wooden ladder was placed against the window				474.53772415883685
by my father s tomb said he extending his hand over the head of the young girl i swear to you haydée that if any misfortune happens it will not be to me i believe you my lord as implicitly as if god had spoken to me said the young girl presenting her forehead to him				33.02444135161378
i do not know i only guess it because that sort of thing is generally found in prisoners cells yes sir a rope ladder and tools and have you them yet no sir i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but i have still something left what is it asked the count impatiently				9706.643568738275
let us choose a place of rendezvous continued athos and in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the conduct we are to maintain toward each other good the other three exclaimed				3116.6312825157734
well i will go to england a second time i will go and find buckingham you shall not do that d artagnan said athos coolly				8561.043937302446
you are punctual said he as he drew back the door				183.27924759629553
his wife visited for him and this was the received thing in the world where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiority in fact the application of the axiom pretend to think well of yourself and the world will think well of you an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks know thyself a knowledge for which in our days we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing others				1132.1520962150628
as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have striven to repress it				91.70882236938738
speak then chevalier said the cardinal				244.26293297319097
danglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering and monte cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which passed over his features but which was gone in a moment				551.8034371361367
as to d artagnan scarcely on his side was he out of sight when he drew from his pocket a letter which he read over again return immediately to paris j				1015620.0440737765
the telegraph chapter				163.61967341798479
the guards retired the room resumed its obscurity				4508.110318411777
if she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself you do not understand me maximilian				458.35306458419285
bertuccio s forehead was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the window he cried to the coachman rue de la fontaine no				1034.3828714547576
ali having pointed to the apartments held up three fingers of his right hand and then placing it beneath his head shut his eyes and feigned to sleep				943.2378750605014
oh pardon me pardon me cried she sinking upon the shoulders of milady				567.9240016534692
my father thought that this action had been miraculously performed he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us				357.7524717858134
i understood that i had nothing to fear that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the garden				2240.599000183644
do you regret them asked morrel with his open laugh				2261.193547647706
sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes but like a phosphoric light they rise but to mislead				832435.1465025119
he proceeded nevertheless and came opposite to an iron gate ornamented in the taste of the period				20160.757611034063
for the last year my faithful highlanders have fought for honor alone athos smiled				485.4569157813428
no indeed cried d artagnan				10.313246099944651
friquet had a quick eye and a fine ear				1512.0243518383816

bonacieux to join her				162.37718822947372
the mourning in her heart forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had time to put on the outward semblance of woe				672809.8738925745
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens albert approached				1725.0149718455436
p s i sign my full name for i should be vain if i could suppose that after five years of absence you would remember my initials the poor duke became perfectly giddy				1531773.364063386
he checked by degrees the speed of his horse and went on his head drooping as if in deep thought				2120.025725362242
in his escape alone apart from his plans for the future which it must be admitted were for the present sufficiently vague and uncertain there was a beginning of vengeance which filled his heart				400.13833379473664
then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an instrument of god s justice he will be found well said the cardinal then it will be time to claim the order which you just now required your eminence is right replied milady and i have been wrong in seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which it really is that is to announce to his grace on the part of your eminence that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by madame the constable that you have proofs of the interview granted at the louvre by the queen to a certain italian astrologer who was no other than the duke of buckingham that you have ordered a little romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of amiens with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took place and portraits of the actors who figured in them that montague is in the bastille and that the torture may make him say things he remembers and even things he has forgotten that you possess a certain letter from madame de chevreuse found in his grace s lodging which singularly compromises not only her who wrote it but her in whose name it was written				44338.84491457641
he did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble and displayed it with affectation before the queen				412.53566173305893
those lips were magnificent they might be said to be of coral				1635970.701240118
in one the queen asked for the ornaments back again				309.7070025699465
is this the man asked the captain who was attentively reading plutarch s life of alexander				27357.639669701446
the more they are persecuted the more she thinks of them and often when they least expect it they have proof of a kind remembrance alas said milady i believe so the queen is so good oh you know her then that lovely and noble queen that you speak of her thus cried the novice with enthusiasm				2684.127723575178
meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly alas resistance was far from my thoughts				1099.9398217796352
he was called count he was said to possess livres per annum and his father s immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme				745571.8991404239

the musketeers saluted bicarat with their swords and returned them to their sheaths				1276418.1655542904
porthos had bicarat and aramis found himself opposed to two adversaries				645534.133086744
the travelers then comprehended that there must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence and ceased to address themselves to him				33.397913349391274
it was easy to call his jailer s attention to the noise and watch his countenance as he listened but might he not by this means destroy hopes far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity				3796.1370887195735
after closing the door carefully behind him mordaunt glided into the subterranean passage sheathing on the way his now useless sword and thus reached the neighboring house where he paused to examine himself and to take breath				4377.84831200667
you may one day be the captain of a vessel				12373.88717879158

the exclamations the insults addressed to benedetto who remained perfectly unconcerned the energetic gestures the movement of the gendarmes the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance all this lasted five minutes before the door keepers and magistrates were able to restore silence				535.3903878290126
i repeat to you i don t know her why she is the old wife of a procurator of the châtelet monsieur named madame coquenard who although she is at least fifty still gives herself jealous airs				1211032.375892673
after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do honor to the gift reappeared with it on her finger				1834.9935711444948
evidently he did not understand his meaning				2332.711237668266
the coadjutor proceeded onward to the quay by way of the rue de la monnaie there he found groups of bourgeois clad in black cloaks or gray according as they belonged to the upper or lower bourgeoisie				1343257.3775522958

in the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized cocles but as he had but one eye and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years cocles did not recognize the count				295.1957688952822
it is a duel then cried mordaunt as if disposed to reply at once to the provocation				1042746.3057300397
when i saw you at your chateau at bragelonne i made certain proposals to you which you perfectly understood instead of answering me as a friend you played with me as a child the friendship therefore that you boast of was not broken yesterday by the shock of swords but by your dissimulation at your castle d artagnan said athos reproachfully				1478726.4106781331
i will make verses said he				7.2774120021421975

d artagnan on his part entered boldly at the principal gate				1164.9760398113685
nobody knows better than yourself that the bandits of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma for my own part i protest that should i ever go to corsica my first visit ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the bandits of colomba if i could only manage to find them for on my conscience they are a race of men i admire greatly still persisted franz i suppose you will allow that such men as vampa and his band are regular villains who have no other motive than plunder when they seize your person				843.1910677388418
then the duke put to pistache this difficult question who was the greatest thief in the world				693.2438657640375
but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had drawn				101264.65023208137
let us visit this one first added he				424.61696989830546
lucullus dines with lucullus porthos looked at the bottle which was near him and hoped that with wine bread and cheese he might make a dinner but wine was wanting the bottle was empty				1830.4518616819073

with what view with the view of assassinating or causing to be assassinated the duke of buckingham d artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation				765102.2608105388
an instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head saying i thought so and sliding from the shoulders of dantès as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground				614.8299409295456
save your skin begone quickly d artagnan did not budge				2443048.9833075567
the queen breathed more freely				6503.340575422538
he hoped then in a conversation with anne of austria to obtain some information from that conversation and afterward to come upon his eminence with some secret which the cardinal either knew or did not know but which in either case would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister				1753.7272065220704
the three presents of d artagnan the elder on the first monday of the month of april the market town of meung in which the author of romance of the rose was born appeared to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the huguenots had just made a second la rochelle of it				100.940432270659
yes replied the young woman and fear much that he finds our home but a dull one i will undertake to divert him replied the count				277.4463323927939
what could you do against a dozen bandits who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their pieces at you eh parbleu they should kill me the innkeeper turned to franz with an air that seemed to say your friend is decidedly mad my dear albert returned franz your answer is sublime and worthy the let him die of corneille only when horace made that answer the safety of rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a motive albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible words				737.3594577586106
ah it is you my lord said he				11.022809499792166

he told me he knew nothing about the matter that the orders i had received did not come from him and that if i had the audacity to mention his name as being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged				86134.8521551108
five minutes afterward they knocked at the prince s door				184.12849737496975
to you perhaps they will accord the time they have refused to me				83.57110308815543

it was said at this moment that danglars was worth from six to eight millions of francs and had unlimited credit				8637.311014075742

after he had remained through the heat of the day unconscious on the battle field the cool freshness of the night brought him to himself				197.7931739172941

it is you your honor he said advancing toward d artagnan and i am truly pleased to meet you d artagnan looked attentively at friquet and recognized the little chorister of the rue de la calandre				3309021.7578308787
then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel				1301179.9721132335
she inquired if the baron was still at the castle				3445.7651925527366
the family began to get accustomed to their obscurity				4985.271408333295
he spoke in a voice of the procureur general with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the law				1719.949749551878

the count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire and to ali to follow to his study where they conversed long and earnestly together				621.6162736512621
the queen had at first positively refused but at length became afraid that the duke if exasperated would commit some folly				23124.8073606262
as for aramis of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the character a character which like that of his companions we shall be able to follow in its development his lackey was called bazin				3804.712338446186
d artagnan was conqueror without much effort it must be confessed for only one of the officers was armed and even he defended himself for form s sake				5819.741454002625
in a week remember you will no longer be performing your manoeuvres for practice but on a field of battle then suddenly in order not to give too uncomfortable an importance to this observation see raoul he resumed what a fine plain for partridge shooting the young man stored in his mind the admonition whilst he admired the delicate tenderness with which it was bestowed				1295602.9360967097

franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting place and from whence his eyes followed the motions of albert and his guides who holding torches in their hands had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui				953640.9952858489
and now he said after today you will come and live with me you can occupy haydée s apartment and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son haydée said morrel what has become of her she departed last night to leave you to wait for me				69.55822245121689

this fashion is coming in				863.425116701852
in the meantime dispose of my coachman my carriage and my servants we have forgotten to mention that the count s coachman was attired in a bear skin exactly resembling odry s in the bear and the pasha and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed				2558.9712748798615
what do you want asked blaisois				8960.490210396181

she was my mother				691.3388008172628
monsieur and dear friend ah yes				1794.5650294850027
i will go down then he descended a smile on his lips and murmuring that last word of human philosophy perhaps but instead of the darkness and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find dantès saw a dim and bluish light which as well as the air entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks				498024.41874428047
his prediction was nearly fulfilled but in a very different way from that which de bassompierre supposed for after the death of richelieu everything went on contrary to expectation in the same way as before and bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison				1231.9587536682893
he glanced around looked in the bed shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney				17983.924986186776

the valet ran directly				39109.71746419134
you are safe you are free mazarin replied only by a groan he could not believe in such a miracle				50237.175244918915
i have had ten or twelve sailors under me and if you question them they will tell you that they love and respect me not as a father for i am too young but as an elder brother but you may have excited jealousy				19196.330914061567
all that he was allowed to say in case of emergencies was the proverbial der teufel				1526232.321312664
he wished bernajoux a speedy convalescence took leave of m de la trémouille returned to his hôtel and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner				2137.5684035620566

in that case let there be no more question of what s past and let aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him aramis drew the letter from his pocket the three friends surrounded him and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar				1362112.0141349514
during the night between the and of september madame morrel remained listening for every sound and until three o clock in the morning she heard her husband pacing the room in great agitation				3180.466287497655

ideology if the count of monte cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of parisian society he would have appreciated better the significance of the step which m de villefort had taken				1863.0588099462493
they had only halberds before now they have muskets				2081.699096439979

albert beauchamp and château renaud remained alone				1022.5883957047499
the guests having eaten the soup were about to lift the first glass of wine to their lips when all at once the cannon sounded from fort louis and fort neuf				10970.437589624693
it is running now d artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into a burning fever				19053.502424430746
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since fear urges me not my conscience but replied madame danglars the count of monte cristo can know nothing or he would not seek our society as he does oh the wickedness of man is very great said villefort since it surpasses the goodness of god				602.4902896442558
at beauvais they stopped two hours as well to breathe their horses a little as to wait for porthos				175.3648545434091

you like m maximilian morrel do you not grandpapa asked valentine				367.76564740078487
the second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices one deep whisper intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred all eyes all thoughts were occupied with the young and beautiful woman whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle				7174.643092633452
beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had met monte cristo who was directing his steps towards the rue de la chaussée d antin to m danglars				443.6223174881595
he examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep and having found his diamond ring on his finger his purse in his pocket and his pistols in his belt he rose paid for his bottle and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before				873.8307902529126

this voice was heard by the two friends who set off full gallop				1669.4666375867694
villefort rose or rather sprang from his chair hastily opened one of the drawers of his desk emptied all the gold it contained into his pocket stood motionless an instant his hand pressed to his head muttered a few inarticulate sounds and then perceiving that his servant had placed his cloak on his shoulders he sprang into the carriage ordering the postilions to drive to m de saint méran s				887.7004013804454
proceed was heard on all sides				4387.239689075036

he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others so that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish english and german				217647.54077443367
milady was no longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment terrified him she was an ardent passionate mistress abandoning herself to love which she also seemed to feel				121982.24998790809
lord de winter took a chair drew it toward her and sat down close beside her				201.13839935060602
forward cried d artagnan in his stentorian voice we shall laugh over all this in five minutes and they darted on anew				734247.4187907327
i only know one thing i dislike more which is the sound of your voice really said danglars				401.5332238942002
at last after a few moments cromwell raised his head and as if he divined that some one was there turned slowly around				1982.514216079845
as the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other two combatants				97998.1066732312
athos and aramis placed themselves behind him				34.02998962672136
he had thought the king and queen charming at the ball				31631.173682705332
i felt my strength fail and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the coward to prevail but my swoon felton listened without uttering any word or sound except an inward expression of agony				3445.2263081019178
the porter was not yet gone to bed				706.8002543315795
so much penetration so much frankness created admiration but did not entirely remove his suspicions				12030.274851527969
he causes a disturbance in your hostelry which respectable people can not put up with				5331.264072268155
this thought the house of morrel is about to stop payment bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise have done				1485.6985810937065
during the day i had nothing to fear				1291.4160221792
that will do i will be there endeavor not to make me wait for at quarter past twelve i will cut off your ears as you run good cried d artagnan i will be there ten minutes before twelve and he set off running as if the devil possessed him hoping that he might yet find the stranger whose slow pace could not have carried him far				12552.659994324431
the groom cried aloud for help				3175.950134698319
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the master the one in carrying out the ideas of the other was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to be the smell of time had in a single day acquired the aspect of life was scented with its master s favorite perfumes and had the very light regulated according to his wish				1334.8856530254682
never said d artagnan				7.5206101105132745
tis well				510.27611080932434
i will read you the letter containing the accusation at least said villefort the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religious institutions of his country that one named edmond dantès mate of the ship pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been the bearer of a letter from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris				492.479755351422

there was no time to lose				2652.9730691760387
here i have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown trees beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will				730.6050481899289
i have asked the headsman of bethune he said his voice hoarse and his face livid with passion and grief				993.7497785395506
mordaunt had called on the bishop that very evening to apprise him of the religious desire expressed by the king and also of cromwell s permission				5981.618238383805
do you expect news from him i expect himself himself				161.43454551676493
monte cristo drew him in gently				834723.8445654341
the latter put his hand to his sword and said with the smile of a man who for thirty years has jested with death would you assassinate me sir				843.3137064305567
in your situation distrust those who are well provided with every formality enter the guardroom said the sergeant we will lay your case before the commandant of the post the guardroom was filled with citizens and common people some playing some drinking some talking				157869.55717829417
while we can not and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate				3374.3391372543424
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present				6437.892981283904
besides how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at st				2175.0590993419974
the servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment				2173.4272392823323
at last after renewed hesitation dantès entered the second grotto				3531.1344277782387
you have come then at last				3036.5360014771436
the celebrated cucumetto pursued in the abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the garigliano like manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno				1039713.7032426421
her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance but overpersuaded by the advice of her women she at last had the appearance of beginning to forget				23509.251587916056
but at the sight of the young man who detached himself from the wall like a statue walking from its niche and at the noise of the steps which she heard resound behind her mme				220.61183250168767
now continued villefort those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the crime was committed on whose heads the justice of man may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly destroyed noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame				5001.543436362819
planchet much surprised at the inquiry turned back				595.1710133152255
yes especially if you will show me the poor abbé s room ah				505.19745855609466
maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse gazed all around the room then upon the two men he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and d avrigny for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged glances which seemed to say he is mad but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an extraordinary weight				65548.62821369166
greet each other then and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads rochefort and d artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips but the cardinal was there observing them with his vigilant eye				3419.021768262521
the groom turned toward him with a look of surprise but made no reply				1028.387811528771
the marechal de la meilleraie was caught between two fires but he was brave and made up his mind to die where he was				1872.7494529552396
it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind				701.1159920145589
replied now as to the worthy cardinals spada and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to dinner something tells me that we shall get that money back				694.2488482660399
you will say that i keep it i will perform your commission word for word my lord and now resumed buckingham looking earnestly at the young man how shall i ever acquit myself of the debt i owe you d artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes				580.7806849934265
the count followed her with his eyes				596.5808944797078
is the countess up yet if you wish i will inquire yes ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete and tell her i shall have the honor of seeing her about three o clock and that i request permission to introduce someone to her the valet left the room				183.15239491140034
sit down morrel and wait morrel obeyed the count arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his gold chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the corners of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of women symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven				599.1449293173758
the man placed his finger on her lips				434.97094503713197
this idea soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever terrible consequences might result to herself from it she implored the captain to put her on shore but the captain eager to escape from his false position placed between french and english cruisers like the bat between the mice and the birds was in great haste to regain england and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman s caprice promising his passenger who had been particularly recommended to him by the cardinal to land her if the sea and the french permitted him at one of the ports of brittany either at lorient or brest				870066.4302808066
fernand was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow countrymen found danglars there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received promises and made pledges on his own part guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in fact rendered such services in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of honor destiny				12966.213739084926
come this way and let us know when the wedding is to be for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell us hold your tongue will you said danglars pretending to restrain caderousse who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor				47177.573800003935
in all probability this time his master would not retract				196407.58086261505
dust i am and to dust i return				1612.9135817835925
gondy sprang to the window and threw it open he recognized louvieres at the head of a troop of about three or four thousand men				1216.0011190390749
it was useless to search at night and dantès therefore delayed all investigation until the morning				399.4739451021961
the door being closed the four friends waited in expectation				21562.750095248237
alas i have only my tongue but i will try to show that it is good for something				5855.622249564499
the abbé took it and in return gave caderousse the diamond				1537.751542984078
can he be inconstant before being happy oh no he must have been prevented by monsieur de tréville or monsieur dessessart				17013.73888531795
dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves				4761.245533855014
he was a berrichon thirty five or forty years old mild peaceable sleek employing the leisure his master left him in the perusal of pious works providing rigorously for two a dinner of few dishes but excellent				15953.17242820446
close by here monsieur replied the notary a little beyond passy a charming situation in the heart of the bois de boulogne so near as that said the count but that is not in the country				2031.8773166541862
go go directly d artagnan rose took his hat as if it had been his intention to obey then opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading to the staircase he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of milady				542.9768516452154
i was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls and pardieu i picked up two that i sold for ten pistoles each				8919.149278798763
oh if you refuse my advice what do you advise said valentine raising her eyes to heaven and sighing				6117.567040284899
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among ladies oh i am aware of that said madame de villefort but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on i beg of you what you say interests me to the greatest degree well replied monte cristo suppose then that this poison was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first day two milligrammes the second day and so on				1254.0281546195242
on his return from the vatican franz carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him a treasure of pious thoughts to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation				1250484.3561743214
lord winter answers for his regiment or at least very nearly so we will not split straws about words let him place himself at the head of his men we will place ourselves at the side of your majesty and we will mow a swath through cromwell s army and reach scotland there is another method said aramis				195.79200158399325
my dear m d artagnan the welfare of the state is deposited in your hands he paused				2622.358833220634
to saint peter s first and then to the colosseum returned albert				327.3671690788131
you did not see her				145.93842912717247
aramis smiled as one who hopes				17166.797543965906
when they arrived at the antechamber above the door was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the rest of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon				1059389.416112219
it was quite evident by her manner that her uneasiness was not feigned and franz himself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them truths				1013301.0315746755
what could he say				849.3120996462469
fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his name kept on the army roll				1211090.1237931403
thank you cried he throwing himself on his horse				892.5658429770588
there is everything in a jesuit convent then you would have killed monsieur de marsillac if he had come alone to attack you instead of at the head of twenty men undoubtedly said aramis and even at the head of his twenty men if i could have drawn without being recognized god pardon me said d artagnan to himself i believe he has become more gascon than i am then aloud well my dear aramis do you ask me why i came to seek you no i have not asked you that said aramis with his subtle manner but i have expected you to tell me well i sought you for the single purpose of offering you a chance to kill monsieur de marsillac whenever you please prince though he is hold on				1235.031384984549
ah what else is there said danglars for at present i can not say that i have seen anything extraordinary				8843.78343652043
valentine the time has arrived when you must answer me				41.51882489927857
the young man is here said the valet de chambre in the same tone				504.30331869242116
i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by way of atoning in some slight degree not for the crime i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent				113418.2752082982
his grace the duke of buckingham will not set out for france				551.6316462731844
perhaps some day they will want to make you king instead of the prince of wales or the duke of york your elder brothers				26776.453183175385
but to return to the charming musicians you should give us a treat danglars without telling them there is a stranger				1813.348909919855
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian glass of beautiful shape and color while the feet rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the door by which franz had entered and also in front of another door leading into a second apartment which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated				92962.80609616377
is my lord pleased with his escort asked d artagnan				12.767162316498338
the cardinal was lavish to his underlings yes yes guitant said mazarin richelieu was a great man a very great man but he had that defect				927742.071742407
then she rang for her lady s maid and weak as she was she dressed in order to be ready for whatever might happen				3223.7159201818795
so many loathsome animals inhabited the prison that their noise did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the noise was really louder than usual edmond raised his head and listened				6203.637439325176
but the wind was contrary the sea bad they tacked and kept offshore				1282407.8381721776
tomorrow this order will be sent to the duke of buckingham				1016.5933420407414
a neighboring church clock slowly struck the hour				1408.9020691790613
the iron box was there no one had touched it under a beautiful fig tree my father had planted the day i was born which overshadowed the spot				3657.4210607016976
but it s all my fault yes it s all my fault because it is myself who selects my men				1212.5554149994566
it wounded the pride of the parliament which supported by the citizens replied by declaring that cardinal mazarin was the cause of all the discontent denounced him as the enemy both of the king and the state and ordered him to retire from the court that same day and from france within a week afterward enjoining in case of disobedience on his part all the subjects of the king to pursue and take him				36.88264508378917
they say joy never hurts and so i came to you without any warning				10697.101337903854
the officer entered a large fat man with an open physiognomy				176889.33847555448
debray stretched himself upon a large couch and madame danglars passed into her dressing room with mademoiselle cornélie				979706.8363999014
it was a long time since the magistrate had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the truth more exactly it was the first time he had ever heard of it				86.26855574233633
at the end of another two hours the horses had gone twelve leagues without stopping their legs began to tremble and the foam they shed whitened the doublets of their masters				2933.5924404124994
it was expected that this wedding would shortly take place as the young man was received at the banker s as the betrothed				1903.4513674653415
the truth madame said mazarin placing a pen and a paper before her you must then he added sign anne i implore you i command you the queen fell into a chair took the pen and signed				19711.772572182286
at length he went to bed fell asleep and had golden dreams				4574.319024407914
but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman will transact his business without my knowing the sum peppino nodded and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the attendant had gone out				499.74834034513765
d artagnan believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape drew a pistol from his belt but athos raised his hand				199.6635540773996
during this time the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those which precursors of the storm began to play in at the windows				1423.7686616533774
i fell upon one knee then upon both				9047.854148802271
about three months ago i was near having a duel with aramis concerning a handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his house for a handkerchief marked in the same manner i am sure monsieur said the young woman you weary me very much i assure you with your questions but you madame prudent as you are think if you were to be arrested with that handkerchief and that handkerchief were to be seized would you not be compromised in what way				907.1103527408403
laugh as much as you will replied albert i am in love you alarm me cried franz				446.55709673691666
he is coming to play with us this evening oho said porthos his eyes glistening at the news				6731.621842571687
the judges were looking for a new outbreak from the benches				112616.48994637803
speak gentlemen speak i am listening conceal nothing gloss over nothing				689.7855607881346
the two rooms looked on to the street a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as an inappreciable advantage				36639.30317791112
unfold your plan my lord and we will see take notice that you are shut up captured you well know my lord that there always remains to us a last resource what that of dying together mazarin shuddered				4372.682660644369
at this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock				80960.58887744624
but on our return he said aloud may we that is my friend and i depend on having he his barony and i my promotion on the honor of mazarin i should like another sort of oath better said d artagnan to himself then aloud may i not offer my duty to her majesty the queen her majesty is asleep and you must set off directly replied mazarin go pray sir one word more my lord if there s any fighting where i m going must i fight you are to obey the commands of the personage to whom i have addressed the inclosed letter tis well said d artagnan holding out his hand to receive the money				1010.2667700020079
as i expected my officer was there				780.5403966160135
when one thinks that for twenty years during which time i did not know what to do with myself it never occurred to me to come to study rueil what difference does that make said porthos				197.97453069902235
monseigneur will be with him in an hour good said friquet my fortune is made by the way said bazin where was he carried to the tower saint jacques la boucherie and delighted with the success of his embassy friquet started off at the top of his speed				1681.1233060602922
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the moment when i reckoned upon success my hopes are forever dashed from me				77.80851775455771
he thought of that young and pretty mme				156.1986176432375
shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all then the steps retreated and the voices died away in the distance the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued the silence of death which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of dantès				638.1615479092229
and to sign the contract in three days yes then in my turn i also say very well danglars pressed his daughter s hand in his				1392.5808245877404
did you bet oh merely a paltry fifty louis and who was the winner nautilus				1136429.957469441
a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating				23413.33253296387
gentlemen he said our presence here is the best proof of former friendship not one of us has failed the others at this rendezvous not one has therefore to reproach himself hear me count replied d artagnan instead of making compliments to each other let us explain our conduct to each other like men of right and honest hearts i wish for nothing more have you any cause of complaint against me or monsieur d herblay				2359.551336972028
but d artagnan whose ideas had taken quite another course forgot himself like a fool and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts				2756219.3519932125
it is not monsieur porthos that your lordship means yes that is my companion s name				764.3542886042657

he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor				5889.207584595466
all these proofs of an energetic resolution which albert did not fear on his own account alarmed him for his mother				747.7718025425138
my orders asked grimaud				353.24630641120007

monsieur said the old man ask me nothing for if i dared tell you what i have seen certainly no good would befall me you have then seen something replied d artagnan				61.49430967537024
but this war may bring round a peace this peace will require a negotiator that negotiator will be me				88.43091302730011
maillard began the curate this gentleman and i have come to talk with you a little with me said the mendicant it is a great honor for a poor distributor of holy water there was an ironical tone in his voice which he could not quite disguise and which astonished the coadjutor				1289.8971336738853
the usher returned and made a sign to d artagnan to follow him				30.3983888997949
rochefort obeyed and retired				832.8094614396672
