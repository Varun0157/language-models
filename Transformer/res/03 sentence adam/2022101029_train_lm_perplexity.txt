replied the count				185.4311083886498
in the court which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young man with his hands in his pockets who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen walking				15663.988114909653
danglars had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town				6291.110782384693
monsieur cardinal is indeed a privileged man imagine my astonishment continued milady when i found myself face to face with this woman does she know you no then she looks upon you as a stranger milady smiled				467.3306463332528
but first of all how are madeleine and antoinette madeleine was the daughter of m d avrigny and antoinette his niece				8768.368702830054
in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was halfway down in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground				610.5336089226649
well do you not adopt this means athos said d artagnan				20.012316403815483
from time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen searching glances but rapid as the lightning flash				15518.126340625176
in exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness				10842.131795623969
upon my soul that future captain of mine is a lucky dog				4191.8824726952125
be easy i am a gentleman				855.1622996071835
i thank you gentlemen said he for having complied with my request i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship morrel had stepped back as morcerf approached and remained at a short distance				2194.8680727095666
on the evening of the twenty fifth as they were entering arras and as d artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a glass of wine a horseman came out of the post yard where he had just had a relay started off at a gallop and with a fresh horse took the road to paris				516.2896070129038
athos alighted and calmly opened the handkerchief tied at each corner whilst d artagnan ever cautious remained on horseback one hand upon his pistol leaning forward watchfully				15304.76613439759
my kingdom is bounded only by the world for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard i am a cosmopolite				10621.338748897302
the conflict was not long the wretch had nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus				23223.663521686514
and now once more adieu said morrel				250.42178327038195
and good bye to my dream of resembling the retired baker				9335.491205132432
he then entered the room				219.161132534902
on reaching the palace d artagnan sent to his eminence the letter in which he had been ordered to return without delay				2246.200136409207
bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st denis or in the fair of st germain in company with athos porthos and aramis to whom d artagnan had often remarked this				748.6601776323732
he could not do this he whose past life was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful				8158.782575223202
this way light us downstairs bernouin the valet held a wax light the cardinal took a key from his bureau and opening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the palais royal				2361.3871243260855
place that table there said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of felton				1029.3518470715744
see the sneaks come without drum or trumpet				6633.049593557738
never mind that foolish girl villefort said the marquise				3202.673164993671
m de villefort s communications on the subject were very limited and concise he told her in fact that an explanation had taken place between m noirtier m d épinay and himself and that the marriage of valentine and franz would consequently be broken off				1433.0222172229348
d artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not so				473.89462790356276
the note is changed				3818.518203708008
let us draw lots				14153.703898335074
the door is opened to all who knock				21591.867572060957
the next day they kept their word and thus they grew up together				621.6746691122358
this foraging did not occupy more than half an hour				1337.779873873094
who knows				2811.2414290578954
married at eighteen to m bonacieux having always lived among her husband s friends people little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman whose heart was above her position mme				235.78169615136164
ah said morcerf i see you are a stickler for forms my dear sir and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted				12161.293081059915
meanwhile raoul closely observed the young general already made so famous by the battles of rocroy fribourg and nordlingen				14699.288229117705
at the same time added château renaud your count of monte cristo is a very fine fellow always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti there are no italian banditti said debray				418.55507856880797
tell the king that if he sleeps badly to night he will sleep better to morrow night these blunt words so terrible if taken literally were received by the other workmen with a roar of laughter				1196.4331434141095
their horses flew and they never ceased speaking of athos and aramis				179.94045659143956
besides you owe me some thanks				3655.8448296363063
valery but listen				1813.0099901170283
this miserable strain confines me to my bed but mousqueton forages and brings in provisions				1287.2679285720374
whilst this scene was going on d artagnan remained with open mouth and a confused gaze				10698.27458058162
but what can you expect from the brother of a capuchin monk brought up in the school of cardinal richelieu				2862.9834433091723
four men carried me from paris to châlons walking six leagues a day madame de villefort followed the litter in her carriage				560.563906276642
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal				317.2325089111031
it gave me pain and it was an ungracious part to play but i have said nothing either to the one or to the other				385.69177785139965
no it is not finished i feel it by what remains in my heart				369.3046995813519
after a minute or two they were able to distinguish a man who approached them swimming vigorously				19298.79333744447
a truce to compliments said aramis we want to see the coadjutor and instantly as we are in haste certainly sir it is not such lords as you are who are allowed to wait in the ante chamber only just now he has a secret conference with monsieur de bruy de bruy cried the friends tis then useless our seeing monsieur the coadjutor this evening said aramis so we give it up and they hastened to quit the palace followed by bazin who was lavish of bows and compliments				5149.734699136612
athos cried the two musketeers				717.172522734814
but go a little way from france go either to aleppo or cairo or only to naples or rome and you will see people passing by you in the streets people erect smiling and fresh colored of whom asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say that man was poisoned three weeks ago he will be a dead man in a month then remarked madame de villefort they have again discovered the secret of the famous aqua tofana that they said was lost at perugia ah but madame does mankind ever lose anything				2500.9207754702975
good he said nothing almost nothing scratches nothing more two in the arm and one in the breast				1338.691109781837
in spite of his repugnance to address the guards dantès turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his hand comrade said he i adjure you as a christian and a soldier to tell me where we are going				2368.929813856948
in the morning i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness i have enjoyed in your presence then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus				14736.287042533871
when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight that grimaud kept bad watch cried porthos who had a great inclination to vent his ill humor on somebody				13399.026270184519
at this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened and a woman appeared				1149.6420648899125
i expected this said felton				1969.0400116518451
the wife of athos chapter xxviii				3014.49486171769
faria the beneficent and cheerful companion with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed				21100.665520644015
the cries died away in groans and next morning as soon as wasilio s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when assunta although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open and the money stolen				21410.82749881211
on the other hand as the two friends approached to enter they showed them every kind of civility thinking them deserters from the royal party and wishing to bind them to their own				968.7042912826626
is this that bonacieux asked he after a moment of silence				528.6084228210477
scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears began to tingle a faintness seized him a cloud of blood passed over his eyes and he fell in the middle of the street crying still coward				1013.7789116317396
but there is the cardinal always at hand who does not leave me a moment s repose who talks to me about spain who talks to me about austria who talks to me about england				858.7033731167269
upon hearing d artagnan s reply aramis seemed about to draw his sword when athos prevented him				32.000076598781675
no replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner				16351.953693317213
i have therefore believed monseigneur knowing your prudence and your personal relation to the events of the present time that you will choose to hold your forces concentrated in the interior of the french kingdom and leave to her own the new government of england				911.5404365790132
the gate of the enclosure was shut but he leaped over the hedge and in spite of the barking of a chained up dog went up to the cabin				6018.514281523865
however i had better find him out first since he can t want money				992.8205062182295
stop yes doubtless replied d artagnan who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair yes doubtless there is one there certainly is one said m de tréville who had a tincture of literature and monsieur de benserade was quoting it to me the other day				447.6145043721526
everything he said proves me to be under the protection of some powerful person this sudden fortune the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to me gold showered down upon me and the most splendid alliances about to be entered into				21435.691794832135
high walls not more than eight or ten feet that is not prudent said caderousse				518.7031769567195
and now continued he with one of his most charming smiles having finished talking to the father in law i must address myself to the banker and what may you have to say to him said danglars laughing in his turn				1214.2385410881523
keep the francs you have left i give them to you				48.17504812327871
now i entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head it seems to suit my shoulders so correctly				33174.67570069382
for me said d artagnan seizing the letter				633.8046232537962
come come cried rochefort				788.3678458134843
the steps were already down and the door open				1486.5928967493774
are you prepared to embrace your worthy father i hope you do not doubt it go then into the drawing room my young friend where you will find your father awaiting you andrea made a low bow to the count and entered the adjoining room				182.1554075607826
no sir replied anne of austria and you may retire until the time that i mentioned to you d artagnan bowed and went out				476.3352722161598
no no never cried milady				241.71344535200538
d artagnan knows that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without dying				1299.2349478104502
at pontoise he changed his horse for the last time and at nine o clock galloped into the yard of tréville s hôtel				1716.5675581642424
however he remained standing clinging to a window				482.7572461153671
now my dear count he said let us on with all the speed we may				36281.9240405131
one more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes but on the contrary the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say if you are my friends rejoice with me for i am very happy as soon as the bridal party came in sight of la réserve m morrel descended and came forth to meet it followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled to whom he had repeated the promise already given that dantès should be the successor to the late captain leclere				19691.593199805164
d artagnan opened the letter and read as follows this is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love you				51.29222086639743
on the walls over the doors on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle axes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open				1451.7952919422928
all the same resumed he after having clicked his tongue against his palate they are brave fellows				6727.116668849357
creating the works from print editions not protected by u s copyright law means that no one owns a united states copyright in these works so the foundation and you				63.10871266578519
excuse me sir replied the man raising his hand to his cap i am not up there i know but i have only just come down do not let me interfere with you in anything my friend said the count gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left i have ten left said the man for here are eleven and i had twenty one five more than last year				1436.9964302628912
let us go to breakfast i shall be happy to do so the morning air has made me hungry yes said porthos my air is excellent they went into the chateau there was nothing but gilding high and low the cornices were gilt the mouldings were gilt the legs and arms of the chairs were gilt				5510.47764704243
be satisfied with being a plain straightforward citizen and turn to that side which offers the most advantages eh eh said bonacieux slapping a plump round bag which returned of sound a money what do you think of this madame preacher whence comes that money you do not guess from the cardinal from him and from my friend the comte de rochefort the comte de rochefort				675.773965933162
for myself on the other hand my lord returned the governor when the first rebel should pass the threshold of my postern doors i should be obliged to kill you with my own hand since you were confided peculiarly to my care and as i am obliged to give you up dead or alive and once more he bowed low before his highness				19641.403684435652
my faith said d artagnan it appears that i was more drunk than you since i remember nothing of the kind athos did not trust this reply and he resumed you can not have failed to remark my dear friend that everyone has his particular kind of drunkenness sad or gay				28948.853104273385
pass replied d artagnan				6.9524480029705416
albert s love had not taken away his appetite				3336.070272400395
don t be a coward or i shall cut off your ears				2045.1104816721731
i suppose the count has the tastes of the day to be sure returned monte cristo it is very convenient then it is more it is magnificent peste let us not lose such an opportunity returned monte cristo				366.6411802754277
and like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed he said by way of changing the conversation you pass your life in travelling yes				1404.4167845560232
renée was with all the rest of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation				26907.799576416764
yes in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious minded companion would have taken weeks to effect				2156.1258578887705
once in service i shall be rich once in m dantès house you will be at rest				1028.4628414144827
and besides even for old soldiers the evening before a battle is a serious time it was so with greater reason to two young men who were about to witness for the first time that terrible spectacle				6806.368353845984
he did not wear the uniform cloak which was not obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence but a cerulean blue doublet a little faded and worn and over this a magnificent baldric worked in gold which shone like water ripples in the sun				2754.0395797113506
afraid of making any inquiries at this house d artagnan entered a small tavern at the corner of the street and asked for a cup of hypocras				14229.685021672965
the sudden extinction of the moccoletti the darkness which had replaced the light and the silence which had succeeded the turmoil had left in franz s mind a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness				1691.0493207247266
besides said the abbé god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a father then a judge do you then believe in god said caderousse				643.8073897740503
they now knew that it required but one hour to take up arms again and one night to reconstruct the barricades				8875.730290544265
he must be retained or rather he must be left quite alone and milady but obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result				10160.53991501249
i will restore you to liberty this moment i will proclaim you a piece of immaculate virtue i will name you the lucretia of england and i will say that you are the sextus				24547.423972399298
you are saying to yourself fifteen days twenty days				506.76064313355
at each moment in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the door keeper s voice was heard announcing some name well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary world and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups				5883.161842199097
this look of porthos s made the gascon regret that he had summoned the brute force of his friend to aid him in an affair which seemed to require chiefly cunning				23142.501061199833
explain yourself count cried the queen whose anxiety grew greater every moment				507.28576210329965
tomorrow morning i start for paris four days to go and the same to return with one day to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the time i shall be absent				3403.2150031094775

it was chance that threw me in your way i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends one of your friends interrupted mme				217.37536511178757
look at his uniform monsieur commissary look at his uniform that s true murmured the commissary pardieu that s true at this moment the door was opened quickly and a messenger introduced by one of the gatekeepers of the bastille gave a letter to the commissary				3207.059096179988
you were saying madame i came to ask you my friend said the baroness what will be done with this impostor impostor repeated villefort certainly madame you appear to extenuate some cases and exaggerate others				1078.9063157769517
a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage stopped peppino opened the door and the count and franz alighted				3565.317837619186
monte cristo and haydée took the beverage in the original arabian manner that is to say without sugar				11590.340589368941
what do you not know your house asked debray				411.6207850717255
a very imposing escort awaited them without the gates				3210.7191370042806
de saint méran madame de saint méran m noirtier how				1279.2910258965903
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities				25048.4617043064
you do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular misers				31607.773652143813
both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay				9794.49869109603
you will see what a fellow he is a man who nearly killed mazarin between two doors				2766.298190789544
then taking a paper out of his pocket he unfolded it slowly				2595.056092438745
i am free replied maximilian and rich enough to support you				57.6095874704639
but these francs here they are and more besides				13108.33755465169
punctuality said monte cristo is the politeness of kings according to one of your sovereigns i think but it is not the same with travellers				20239.046929180426
great personages may have had a hand in what you have seen and if talked about the evil would only recoil upon us ah monsieur stammered planchet more dead than alive ah monsieur what an escape i have had how sirrah				23123.37392528979
during the twenty years i served i often wished to do so but i had not the time these are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other returned monte cristo				324.78457519751464
if i judge for myself my lord she said the cardinal will do nothing and will even perhaps act against us				361.4340166168247
this was more than his life the life of the woman he loved this was in case of ill fortune a means of temporizing and obtaining good conditions				8799.715835787441
before fifteen days are gone by i shall be away from here ah try it milady finding her thoughts betrayed dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony				3757.8407685175744
then he looked about for something to pour the soup into dantès entire dinner service consisted of one plate there was no alternative				16592.48767585128
d artagnan already wore his uniform for being nearly of the same size as aramis and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double he sold his friend a complete outfit				5021.6552658985465
then the landing began				1605.8181624956194
oh do not say so it will break my resolutions but not mine mother replied albert				274.7922710610687
adieu then and be of good courage said athos				9.206525526590086
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory				2133.2469871048343
apropos should mazarin speak to you about me tell him that i should have requested you to acquaint him that in a short time he will see whether i am as he says too old for action and rochefort went away with one of those diabolical smiles which used formerly to make d artagnan shudder but d artagnan could now see it without alarm and smiling in his turn with an expression of melancholy which the recollections called up by that smile could perhaps alone give to his countenance he said go demon do what thou wilt				40734.78385005742
you thought yourselves alone and talked about that tragical death and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of valentine villefort and d avrigny exchanged looks				3550.777914968855
come and i will explain to you and with a firm step morrel went up to his study while maximilian followed him trembling as he went				2683.411079833559

going straight towards him he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects carefully watching the man s countenance as he did so but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing				14142.612870506455
i may then tell the cardinal with respect to this little woman that he may be at ease is that all he will know what that means he will guess at least				2066.161148944204
hasten to monte cristo avail yourself of the fortune for you have indeed suffered long enough a violent convulsion attacked the old man				135.6697957325863
the young man pressed valentine s hand to his lips and then left the house by a back staircase				2857.4134861299426
on reaching the capital athos and aramis found it in arms				532.1762215669711

it was seven o clock in the evening when the marshal arrived at the appointed place				577.0160612612277
in order that there might be no confusion franz wore his peasant s costume				3333.6182185698385
d artagnan made kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following morning				395.1393589437884

have you a carriage no that is of no consequence i always have one ready day and night always ready yes				1436.0600489066608
mazarin gazed at each of them with an affrighted stare recognized them and let drop his lantern uttering a cry of terror				1183.5130398101876
it could no longer be doubted the family name was fully given				837.3576777604618
i monsieur replied the abbé with an air of surprise i want nothing you do not understand continued the inspector i am sent here by government to visit the prison and hear the requests of the prisoners oh that is different cried the abbé and we shall understand each other i hope there now whispered the governor it is just as i told you monsieur continued the prisoner i am the abbé faria born at rome				938.8260778014287
as well as i could judge by the light of the sun the day was already two thirds gone				3448.1221590666173
no indeed sir answered raoul				514.2495651919606
how is it possible for a poor mercer who detests huguenots and who abhors spaniards to be accused of high treason				5470.619903076712
i hear said aramis but i understand neither the noise nor the cry of pain i know not who can have uttered the cry said the king but the noise is easily understood				2554.0171326942527
you are very fortunate my friend but take care or you will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet and which also comes no doubt from your publisher aramis blushed to the eyes crammed in the letter and re buttoned his doublet				5672.238733222396
let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment your lordship does me much honor said the host and i thank you sincerely for your kind wish but don t mistake said d artagnan there is more selfishness in my toast than perhaps you may think for it is only in prosperous establishments that one is well received				2225.377083305281
i have just received my courier from greece said danglars				304.5021042359947
dantès seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible				1303.4073090754948
this movement was accompanied by killing glances at mademoiselle danglars and by sighs launched in the same direction				3315.1381555593434
noirtier had once made a will against you against your family in favor of the poor in fact m noirtier is spared because nothing is expected from him				34.35140051832007
he then returned to paris and although in the same carriage with château renaud and albert he did not hear one word of their conversation				569.9502672582312
having seen jacopo fairly out of the harbor dantès proceeded to make his final adieus on board la jeune amélie distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him				38.88271778683949
madame danglars returned in another cab to the passage on the other side of which she found her carriage and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his box while waiting for her				213.61173845347184
but as lord wilmore in the character of the count s enemy was less restrained in his answers they were more numerous he described the youth of monte cristo who he said at ten years of age entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english				1641.7526356036142
d artagnan without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion continued to watch the proceedings of porthos which amused him greatly				9171.9848900985
they had a youth with them yes sire and one wounded man so that three of the king s musketeers one of whom was wounded and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal s guardsmen but absolutely brought four of them to earth why this is a victory cried the king all radiant a complete victory yes sire as complete as that of the bridge of ce four men one of them wounded and a youth say you one hardly a young man but who however behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that i will take the liberty of recommending him to your majesty how does he call himself d artagnan sire he is the son of one of my oldest friends the son of a man who served under the king your father of glorious memory in the civil war and you say this young man behaved himself well				505.6054617077661
immediately the wits of the court plunged into satire				22987.31696463491
who calls me i said mazarin with his most smiling expression				974.0601568574385
see the fatal example on the vendomois road d artagnan you so brave and you porthos so valiant and so strong you were beaten to day aramis and i are beaten in our turn				1185.4978034695562
but the strangest part of the story is resumed the abbé that dantès even in his dying moments swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention and so he was murmured caderousse				670.8937142559698
he is also the bearer of a second confidential epistle for his eminence				1876.138759077748
we will arrange the matter rather better				788.4283717531644
well i tell you that i come to you from the cardinal this speech was heard by porthos in the same sense as if it had still been in the year and related to the true cardinal				269.2285240369041
sir resumed the cardinal you are to come with me or rather i am to go with you i am at your command my lord returned d artagnan				72.18202236296862
meantime monsieur who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the duc d angoulême by bassompierre or by schomberg who were all eager for his post did but little lost his days in wavering and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the english from the isle of ré where they still besieged the citadel st martin and the fort of la prée as on their side the french were besieging la rochelle				2828.1907173266236

we may well pity the poor fellows said the abbé				427.0316203138454
there were no questions				68843.77125575395
i think these fellows will never come if you are in haste monsieur said d artagnan with the same simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off the duel for three days and if it be your will to dispatch me at once do not inconvenience yourself i pray you there is another word which pleases me cried athos with a gracious nod to d artagnan				57.917913183596056
the frenchman threw her a bouquet teresa returned it all this with the consent of the chief who was in the carriage what cried franz was luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman peasants it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied peppino				1711.028563782524

but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france he is speculating in railways said lord wilmore and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect				14591.909403631209
milady was not deceived				3117.163360895624

but said danglars there is still a sum of one hundred thousand francs oh a mere nothing said monte cristo				282.06634122384736
to nobody in the world not even to athos or porthos i have not breathed a syllable to them good enough tranquil on this important point aramis continued his way with d artagnan and both soon arrived at athos s dwelling				48066.931816610966
during the evident preoccupation of madame de villefort monte cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms lavishing on him the most tender endearments				46175.7283886803

if you wish to see me the king s attorney you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician at this moment and as though the utterance of villefort s wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear				1311.968678027173
the count with outstretched neck and glaring eyes stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon morrel upon the first occasion				1374.7989409679424

athos touched the shoulder of the vicomte				2157.269431518493
in the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell he held open in his left hand of which alone it will be recollected he retained the use a sheet of paper which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open				1491.016388658504
that is it is it not monseigneur and i shall have nothing else to do that is it replied the cardinal dryly				13923.949519225338

by a sort of instinctive impulse franz withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar				15754.476071425355
then turning to his desk he said striking the letter with the back of his right hand come i had a forgery three robberies and two cases of arson i only wanted a murder and here it is				1404.9908159758131
a spent ball not even that what is it then we have said that athos loved d artagnan like a child and this somber and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man				105.74502472989143
there was a moment of frozen silence between these two				1382.035583423492
i gave one to the sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy father the pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to one nearly as large though not so fine given by the emperor napoleon to his predecessor pius vii				3886.9679060288017
will you tell me that they did not lay siege to the hôtel of the duc de la trémouille and that they did not endeavor to burn it which would not perhaps have been a great misfortune in time of war seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots but which is in time of peace a frightful example				2125.886964523399
however he resolved to lead the conversation to a subject which might possibly clear up his doubts				8893.761155650598

the days of expectation are long and d artagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were forty four hours				1691.0219048717825

there go two miscreants said he it is a pity they are not really related then after an instant of gloomy reflection come i will go to see the morrels said he i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred chapter				298.140283298353
oh sir exclaimed m de boville your fears are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a man in despair				1082.3133106759185
ho there boy				1368.9031002195827
i held back his arm				1428.7687363908806
and he bowed profoundly before the cardinal like a man who says lord thy will be done the cardinal approached the table and without sitting down wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two thirds were already filled and affixed his seal				4715.060727315624
i was passing close to the door of the captain s cabin which was half open and i saw him give the packet and letter to dantès he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any letter he will give it to me danglars reflected for a moment				536.6033853313509
but m de tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d artagnan to render the king any signal service or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action				1698.2621857999009
they carried valentine away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the attack				7795.157094829372
she took me away without speaking				2031.9354499621154
if you do i swear to you for i have got to the end of my strength that i will dash my brains out against the wall and you will have my death to reproach yourself with how old are you				61.21497222159281
i have addressed my people and i have spoken to god last of all i speak to you				57.38906624974335
you are mistaken i am not the count of monte cristo then who are you i am he whom you sold and dishonored i am he whose betrothed you prostituted i am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to fortune i am he whose father you condemned to die of hunger i am he whom you also condemned to starvation and who yet forgives you because he hopes to be forgiven i am edmond dantès danglars uttered a cry and fell prostrate				24084.781370007757
see what she writes to me athos said he				15.0547315911296
the fit lasted two hours then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot he fell back doubled up in one last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse				2550.32971083703
this world was not then so good as doctor pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as dantès thought it since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize money manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall				4949.953610421089
it was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means of death of which we were speaking a death without agony a death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing valentine s name and pressing your hand yes you have guessed rightly morrel said the count that is what i intended thanks the idea that tomorrow i shall no longer suffer is sweet to my heart do you then regret nothing no replied morrel				265.30767193341956
we also informed monsieur porthos of what was going on but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman s word and that as he had said the horse was his it must be so that s porthos all over murmured d artagnan				45.79566447469208
it was cold and motionless				1198.4401456820633
oh how our hearts palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there				792.4945909190496
that was a noble example to follow monsieur why replied danglars not entirely so with the servants you understand i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you monsieur while your constituents call you citizen these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government				10864.198808842773
at length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates the noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs				1123.1027437478976
what have you done with that gentleman against whom you had the audacity about twelve days ago to make an accusation of passing false money the host became as pale as death for d artagnan had assumed a threatening attitude and planchet modeled himself after his master				1338.198403797448
what says augustine on this subject severus sit clericorum verbo yes let the sermon be clear said the curate				4978.491600470455
however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their faces became visible				3301.4106991039803
bonacieux knocked as at the shutter three light and regular taps				42431.582384648325
how old was she franz assured me replied albert that she was sixty six years old				8073.0788535269485
as i told you it is an old family jewel and you sold it asked d artagnan hesitatingly				3879.4094785817565
d artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword but bernajoux cried out that it was nothing and rushing blindly upon him absolutely spitted himself upon d artagnan s sword				1368.0632765882008
beware of giving anyone the clue to your griefs the curious suck our tears as flies suck the blood of a wounded hart alas my dear aramis said d artagnan in his turn heaving a profound sigh that is my story you are relating how yes a woman whom i love whom i adore has just been torn from me by force				3855.71162663277
he related the manner in which he had become acquainted with valentine and how he had loved her and that valentine in her solitude and her misfortune had accepted the offer of his devotion				5922.194799589888
were i in her majesty s place said gondy coldly i should not hesitate i should release broussel and if i do not give him up what think you will be the result exclaimed the queen				353.98096658845486
eugénie danglars i can not in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say to me vicomte you know i give my daughter two millions ah this marriage will never take place said beauchamp				731.3725830296013
he thought the carriage was about to stop there				680.5735287430257
ho there my friend the wounded man heaved a sigh				565.4132269695242
ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising i have been more than a year absent from paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the count takes me for a provincial				29800.6129395325
it follows from this that the king s attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should that is to say replied villefort with hesitation that human nature being weak every man according to your creed has committed faults faults or crimes responded monte cristo with a negligent air				1542.2059194291369
well sir the rupture of a blood vessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a day not in an hour but in a second				1010.6416275982386
a magnificent cavalier remarked mazarin				200.82204861285007
yes monsieur officer stammered the mercer more dead than alive at your service come in said the officer				954.1225859862234
at the expiration of ten minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance				676.8530219437278
some sentiment of this kind must have been cherished by each one of these two friends for each of them almost immediately sat down by himself at an end of the tent and began to write				1811.8121743799893
well my boys said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this morning but we will send to the villers coterets and noyon roads and search the forest when we shall catch him no doubt the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the court of the hotel				3398.0163471554997
and she went out but instead of going to her apartment she hastened to consult emmanuel				904.325161580133
no i will go down seize the man unawares and bring him to you ready gagged that is better said the gascon				1151.1396037112006
i have only one thing to ask of you that is the name of your true executioner				972.6626469594025
who is this groslow asked porthos				112.55678088145095
don t you think the executioner might be master cromwell who to make sure of this affair undertook it himself ah				562.1753501974474
i can not have deceived myself he said i must look upon the past in a false light				1141.227563039377
it was purely and simply his removal in terms clear and precise				5946.099412588981
he did not however lose sight of milady and in a mirror he perceived the change that came over her face				632.8210514875555
the writers sometimes looked up at each other and smiled they understood without speaking their organizations were so delicate and sympathetic				49394.87380741377
marry forsooth people don t die of hunger here and aramis drawing in the ladder closed the window				468.841267884834
i shall only reply to you when you have satisfied me of your right to question me				79.12900101095835
my husband has five or six valises you shall choose the best				3455.3213632779953
and alone no my lord madame has visitors have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing and who is with madame m				714.0741066226362
champs élysées				1152.4390485089664
maximilian emmanuel if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the heart monte cristo felt tears start into his eyes and he again walked hastily up and down the room				189.68958722392065
is our little neighbor worse asked d artagnan seeing a look of vexation on the face of the youth				2224.432866864076
madame said debray it is nearly six months since we have been associated				25457.504578175776
heigh sir said d artagnan trying to laugh do you know we look very much like a flock of silly mouse evading women				2631.4188671231514
as for me my heart is overflowing with happiness happy father happy son said the count				252.324135219721
the next morning at daybreak valentine and morrel were walking arm in arm on the seashore valentine relating how monte cristo had appeared in her room explained everything revealed the crime and finally how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death				696.235298303546
dear grandfather said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an hour since and now i have no friend in the world but you his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness				24373.310308304637
yes my friend a presentation				51828.068344061154
i recollect now said the officer in a jeering tone well what do you want with me i want you to spare time to take a walk with me tomorrow morning if you like with the greatest pleasure no not tomorrow morning if you please but immediately if you absolutely insist i do insist upon it come then				1172.2339931746624
fernand s fortune was already waxing great and she developed with his growing fortune				1165.7200969949117
monte cristo watched and saw him approach the valet who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket containing a newspaper and a letter				617.5295308292885
water oh poor woman poor woman murmured athos in a broken voice				671.1925739887171
there was a moment s silence				506.7964074566475
you live in a manner far superior to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money				1020.9941858309842
it is at least a consolation to know that some who have so often risked their lives for us are safe				18534.63444220074
no no monsieur said monte cristo				165.94876184875716
i am replied the latter gravely				2982.49637278444
he was going to throw the crawfish out also when grimaud snatched it from his hands				527.0884212103801
charles leaning on a table was gazing at a medallion of his wife and daughter he was waiting first for juxon then for martyrdom				13487.821756830504
villefort had calculated rightly				3596.489907298144
my good dame asked d artagnan can you tell me what has become of one of my friends whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen days ago a handsome young man three or four and twenty years old mild amiable and well made that is he wounded in the shoulder just so				451.45270964604913
the duc d orléans visited the posts				7618.795502695484
i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease my dear friend said albert to beauchamp it is plain that the affairs of spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this morning				393.83615883808045
a shudder crept through the body of the cardinal who did not shudder readily				11504.158609349024
if your man is mine with one blow i shall obtain two revenges that s all but where to find this man i know not have you no information as to his abiding place none				3903.1487548055848
the ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated				9806.8643182996
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him				28.79033414945956
she was a most atrocious woman and then said aramis with the tone of philosophical indifference which he had assumed since he had belonged to the church and in which there was more atheism than confidence in god what is the use of thinking of it all				197.20458182997987
the baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which over a girl of eugénie s character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of family union the mother to maintain her ascendancy over her daughter must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection				4152.752956407874
chapter xxv				33769.16254239203
who him him m				542.3012542711305
in my opinion a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of mademoiselle danglars broken contract and m danglars disappearance				4620.504257458946
because paris is going to be reduced to dust and ashes like babylon of which you have no doubt heard tell and are you going to leave me at such a time this very instant and where are you going ah if you could tell me that you would be doing me a service ah me				86.0160216334312
no but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted				28662.741356812232
why on board the tartan replied the sailor				1893.9486163458348
athos bowed and obeyed				1281.100384225486
now said monte cristo turning towards morrel i may depend upon you may i not certainly said morrel i am at your service count still what it is desirable i should know the real cause that is to say you would rather not no the young man himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me but i give you my word morrel that god who does know it will be on our side enough said morrel who is your second witness i know no one in paris morrel on whom i could confer that honor besides you and your brother emmanuel				959.4330571643969
villefort was about to retire but m de blacas taking his hand restrained him				29.11833864819394
now i don t set sufficient store on the cut of my jerkin to risk being hung at tyburn or sent for change of scene to the indies				74506.89893047164
beauty has always been and always will be all powerful				9713.987127721259
on leaving paris athos and aramis well knew that they would be encountering great danger but we know that for men like these there could be no question of danger				4640.880443859872
exactly like me				46.129321702156496
doubtless my dear viscount you will not be taken by force and seriously do you wish to break off your engagement i would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so then make yourself quite easy				1276.561691073025
before ten minutes had elapsed the child returned				763.049498479875
there remained then no other place to fear but the traitor s cross the carriage was taking the direct road to it				90.68919153592988
the cardinal pronounced the single word hanged the king was invited to come and see the hanging				25314.56904905113
the spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark affair and the public rumor was that cæsar a better politician than his father had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals				19131.26833287712
overturn the world change its character yield to mad ideas be even criminal but live count i have your word said morrel coldly then taking out his watch he added it is half past eleven morrel can you intend it in my house under my very eyes then let me go said maximilian or i shall think you did not love me for my own sake but for yours and he arose				2492.9566370356206
that s my room replied groslow				2701.512235081134
tis an unfortunate year for kings said the mother				692.5658792923902
pray do people get into a passion at random at noisy				9451.058517723392
this philosophic reflection thought he will make a great sensation at m de saint méran s and he arranged mentally while dantès awaited further questions the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence				9417.211492976823
no no i shall need all my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret as you say				1236.297009251827
he relates that he met at brussels rochefort the âme damnée of the cardinal disguised as a capuchin and that this cursed rochefort thanks to his disguise had tricked monsieur de laigues like a ninny as he is a ninny indeed said porthos but is the matter certain i had it from aramis replied the musketeer				1022.5567016665212
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the air of a man who appreciated their delicacy				18173.888864618548
help help he murmured oh god				277.5019025798642
the queen had passed the night in lonely conference with the prince who had entered the oratory at midnight and did not leave till five o clock in the morning				396.3417786847076
and now gentlemen that s well continued the cardinal				302.53740816073974
well what do you wish me to do for you said beauchamp mildly				258280.51196060795
when the two musketeers had entered when the door was closed behind them when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food had recommenced when m de tréville had three or four times paced in silence and with a frowning brow the whole length of his cabinet passing each time before porthos and aramis who were as upright and silent as if on parade he stopped all at once full in front of them and covering them from head to foot with an angry look do you know what the king said to me cried he and that no longer ago than yesterday evening do you know gentlemen no replied the two musketeers after a moment s silence no sir we do not but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us added aramis in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow				2455.5301999742333
oh said madame de villefort smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed madame danglars rose suddenly				3476.3428482405066
all at once great cries resounded in the pavilion and a woman came to the window and opened it as if to throw herself out of it but as soon as she perceived the other two men she fell back and they went into the chamber				563.6943848130568
but i swear to you before god who hears us that if you betray me and my enemies pardon me i will kill myself while accusing you of my death and i i swear to you before god madame said d artagnan that if i am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me i will die sooner than do anything that may compromise anyone then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the samaritaine				28151.491215688486
the traveller alighted ordered a good dinner and inquired the address of the house of thomson french which was immediately given to him as it was one of the most celebrated in rome				918.2158723170726
at last raoul succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg from under the animal and in a second he was on his feet again				331.4099639101169
my dear albert he said if you will make haste we shall yet have time to finish the night at torlonia s				873.7212116015118
now since as every one knows asparagus takes four years in coming to perfection this civility infuriated monsieur de beaufort				4956.444026187387
come come where either to seek the duc de beaufort or the duc de bouillon and to tell them about this yes but on one condition that we begin by the coadjutor				1258.507735374138
this is a kind of usury banker that i do not understand take all then take all i tell you and kill me come come calm yourself				901.8826099112833
you have no right to put me to death alone				911.775181229896
and when i have signed he said what is to be my guarantee my word of honor sir said athos				110.8281839358331
i have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his actions				3411.592347479496
but albert did not know that it takes a day to see saint peter s and a month to study it				90.32709936163998
parliament can never have passed such an act as that at this moment the landlord came in				948.5990299169989
but it is your real name i want to know in the midst of your hundred names that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the moment when i plunge my sword through your heart the count of monte cristo turned dreadfully pale his eye seemed to burn with a devouring fire				1621.6603125134736
that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said albert you were quite correct in what you said signor pastrini				10365.51450338917
we might say that was his dream				1456.7930640760212
her pretty face arrested my attention i approached and recognized that little kitty whom our friend aramis had placed with her				179.20970763476507
the day passed away without having any other influence on me than to strengthen the resolution i had formed only i took care that my face should not betray the thoughts of my heart for i had no doubt i was watched				8458.472893864824
i have not tried to discover her other name kitty cried milady				386.1549626879617
shall i swear to you sir asked maximilian				1215.6434137640358
show him in said milady in a quick tone but so piercing that d artagnan heard her in the antechamber				2889.466747425998
go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets villefort went immediately				1169.6867676283662
albert de morcerf to return to paris and franz d épinay to pass a fortnight at venice				4483.192088450036
are you satisfied sir there is one thing the queen has not signed her assent to the treaty of what use to day				443.63437518151676
the blade was round and of flexible silver				2843.770537308148
i did all in my power to discover the murderers but no one durst tell me their names so much were they dreaded				16227.580028515911
d artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer s pretty wife for three hours that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude for having delivered her from the men in black who wished to carry her off and that she had promised him nothing				760.8778610253172
he was pale and his eyes were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept				3017.333670884654
it was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the duke of buckingham it was you who had madame bonacieux carried off it was you who in love with de wardes and thinking to pass the night with him opened the door to monsieur d artagnan it was you who believing that de wardes had deceived you wished to have him killed by his rival it was you who when this rival had discovered your infamous secret wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins whom you sent in pursuit of him it was you who finding the balls had missed their mark sent poisoned wine with a forged letter to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends				553.0095816605296
and the more he thought the more entire was his conviction that the person who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer sinbad the sailor under any other circumstances franz would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential nature of the conversation he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his appearance at such a time would be anything but agreeable				4185.606803029726
odds fish				15939.02955925453
i will be silent then said milady casting down her eyes with all the sweetness she could give to her voice with all the resignation she could impress upon her manner				729.4987361680279
they quitted paris beholding it abandoned to extreme want bordering on famine agitated by fear torn by faction				16468.13761324348
i should like you a hundred times better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten years nothing is impossible gravely replied monte cristo and taking leave of albert he returned into the house and struck the gong three times				1349.9551037255633
felton continued to descend				44975.35933838259
he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust				10031.254242505267
under pretense that he s a king it appears he can not dress or undress without assistance really captain said d artagnan determined to continue on the laudatory tack on which he had commenced the more i listen to you the more surprised i am at the easy and elegant manner in which you speak french				2492.9245414145557
give the lackeys money and they will start we will give them money replied athos				88.69637334885581
i hope i am not the cause hush said andrea				1044.0173773434442
she must live that my infamy may diminish hers and villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage				555.3047908006462

those who would as it were force a passage to his heart found an impassable barrier				3560.1397697051725
a most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed on m danglars the count in return for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition and with danglars a free and easy nod				8055.689969850265

some of your words are to me quite empty of meaning				2434.6279901878966
what do you want with me my friend said aramis with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the church				2685.785695352269
aramis not wishing to part with his sword selected a dark blue cloak of a military cut				11285.69415581699
m de beaufort did not venture to draw the cardinal s fat face				642.7135890611964
as for you you have acted like a barmaid				37898.52184717013
but these considerations never occurred to the duke and every day the cardinal received fresh accounts of him which were as unpleasant as possible to the minister				1814.2587732017296
ah to see me said de winter cunningly				25734.16585202253

every few minutes he turned around and thus obliged us to conceal ourselves				1471.9249388939033
in the middle of the stream he stopped the boat and suspending his burden over the water cried in a loud voice let the justice of god be done and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters which closed over it				90.7890102828245

he was at that period of intoxication in which vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep				902.277483277425

yes it is one of milady s bastards you laugh aramis from habit that is all				187.9040380265937
the marchioness raised her head at this word and beholding the man who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted child who still lived for her in valentine she felt touched at the name of mother and bursting into tears she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable head				356.7513197389647
andrea who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the child giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the door very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper				4505.299473126088
it remains here said porthos placing his hand on his heart and pressing it strongly				20063.51303607221

yet continued the count becoming each moment more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which mercédès had accepted yet it is impossible that so noble minded a woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when i am in the prime of life and strength it is impossible that she can carry to such a point maternal love or rather delirium				5497.045984010148
what s the manner cried athos				5.946619855237229

he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish				47192.42350992255

i will repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter i will be faithful to the trust and will not alter a word of his intentions oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young man speak i beg of you valentine cast down her eyes this was a good omen for morrel for he knew that nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming valentine				708.1017074997985
but i was at my own house you understand so there was nothing to be done but to send for the cards which i did				2812.702958609534
without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance				4395.091703126819
how many have you then asked d artagnan				7.64212108662983
he inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor				3849.601467240777
why should an exception be made in her favor i thought that my entreaties what right have you any more than the rest to ask for an exception it is true but never mind continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your turn will come carlini s teeth clenched convulsively				21122.08743249754
yes i am a supercargo pen ink and paper are my tools and without my tools i am fit for nothing pen ink and paper then called fernand loudly				28312.875078167683
grimaud is it thou grimaud signified that he was not mistaken				1800.5418631304913
ten men would have found difficulty in moving that tub but by some mechanical contrivance it had turned with the flagstone on which it rested				33880.290470172054
monte cristo waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his face was a smile which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a visit to the room they were about to enter				1815.7153309737573
he waited silently striving to pierce through the darkness				1058.4708337664415
ah said he i hear a human voice edmond had not heard anyone speak save his jailer for four or five years and a jailer is no man to a prisoner he is a living door a barrier of flesh and blood adding strength to restraints of oak and iron				6016.79261707372
you come from the queen said mazarin looking fixedly at d artagnan				50.72286624189219
but a man were he even a mercer when he had talked for ten minutes with cardinal richelieu is no longer the same man				139.66019899011445
morrel pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered				6992.626681976009
leave me alone said aramis impatiently				9972.725309803447
athos called grimaud pointed to a large basket which lay in a corner and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the napkins				70071.83110717047
is your love returned i suppose so said andrea with a triumphant smile since i am accepted				8498.391739061404
the young man had found signor pastrini looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read albert s letter and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it				83.26025638617052
from whom may the letter be you bear to his eminence from general oliver cromwell said the new comer				93495.55501445218
how is that my friend why thus it is replied dantès				374.9106449477086
what has she written to me said buckingham feebly streaming with blood and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved what has she written to me				70.94589832090413
it is true between ourselves that m de morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art				39505.95034208656
it is a wretched damp nay even horrible spot more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those iron bars				7279.132358145684
our clothes have a cut which would proclaim the frenchman at first sight				8425.978557771261
ascribe to men then what is happening and not to god				521.6819670142035
chapter lxv				19233.54856009316
still further buckingham announced to the mayor that at length the great league was about to declare itself against france and that the kingdom would be at once invaded by the english imperial and spanish armies				52425.95029833106
although weakened the young man s brain instantly responded to the idea that haunts all prisoners liberty				2069.9518169046746
what you would now do amounts to treason d artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning and was silent				1267.682993136352
those barrels i saw through the door port replied grimaud beginning a fresh sum				4761.540687045704
if they are arrested they will only be put in the bastile if we are arrested it is a matter of the place de greve oh				663.595038067249
when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of m de nargonne had married m danglars				521.8844947969416
he saw in fancy the burial of his father and the marriage of mercédès				1723.677199981099
one hour s rapid progress however sufficed to disperse the gloomy fancies that had clouded the young man s bright anticipations and the hitherto unfelt pleasure of freedom a pleasure which is sweet even to those who have never known dependence seemed to raoul to gild not only heaven and earth but especially that blue but dim horizon of life we call the future				1399.209669153362
go out this way said she opening a small private door and come back at eleven o clock we will then terminate this conversation				572.4364221096585
at this moment la ramee after the interview we have described with the cardinal entered the room				175.71750172146352
at whatsoever hour of the day or night you may present yourself remember that i shall be ready to give you absolution thank you my lord said the mendicant in a hoarse voice				807.6116456911782
grimaud s agitation his pallor the sweat which covered his face the dust which soiled his clothes all indicated that he was the messenger of some important and terrible news				5723.261756126705
they descended the great staircase taking with them all the guards they found on their road and crying out to arms				563.3840173428912
shall we obey asked blaisois				8281.828983265505
yes said monte cristo you were a major that is the title the french give to the post which you filled in italy very good said the major i do not demand more you understand your visit here today is not of your own suggestion is it said monte cristo				375.49514602901445
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small vessel of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation				5134.694148528765
and who are you eh pardieu joannes the jeweller well and you said i offended the good god said la carconte with a horrid smile				500.73396073190213
and yet we must be drawing near the disclosure m				639.8532550534424
monsieur said albert with affectionate courtesy the count of château renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me you are his friend be ours also well said interrupted château renaud and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me what has he done asked albert				353.44916755986515
if we were to go together to luigi vampa i am sure he would not refuse you albert s freedom what influence can i possibly have over a bandit have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten what is that have you not saved peppino s life well well said the count who told you that no matter i know it the count knit his brows and remained silent an instant				1192.5554511751643
moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the heart				378.6643816364824
ah m andrea said the latter with his half jesting tone how do you do charmingly as you see				969.8865887165682
the door opened and a dim light reached dantès eyes through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two shadows approach his bed a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand				192.34418620480193
this contest at length exhausted jussac s patience				11527.221258864878
good said monte cristo smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the order of a well disciplined soldier and you leave us said julie at a moment s warning				9280.065944884245
yes a chef d oeuvre of the great florentine sculptor benvenuto cellini replied athos				106.0863846448159
and what do you reckon your outfit will cost said d artagnan				27.654301995478342
as he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations the door opened and rochefort returned				753.8393568790043
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph e				2706.445315718704
here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm				1208.5349913058292
this man had seen valentine and spoken to her				171.11174425177222
m de tréville moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage sprang toward him				38.78915352921663
the conversation took place in english a language which d artagnan could not understand but by the accent the young man plainly saw that the beautiful englishwoman was in a great rage				1447.4246612305262
you will not reply however and these gentlemen i am sure will presently be of my opinion aramis shook his head with a motion of indescribable insolence				48992.53496205151
well then see here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal a gentleman only a simple magistrate who learned more than you with all your police and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the power of directing a telegraph the look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on villefort who bent his head in modest triumph				22324.311135415996
well i shall write to the abbé i shall hold him responsible for his protégé s misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination				9279.588048520309
pardon me monsieur said d artagnan who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back m de tréville s clock three quarters of an hour but i thought as it was yet only twenty five minutes past nine it was not too late to wait upon you twenty five minutes past nine cried m de tréville looking at the clock why that s impossible look rather monsieur said d artagnan the clock shows it that s true said m de tréville i believed it later				6698.615506389277
and you hang it said porthos a little perplexed between the two i suppose as i came with you i must go away with you				63.27664163923199
you are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal				280.63514156024354
but listen to me then resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a little impatience				4564.348710629158
monte cristo summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit				3352.9526553556625
then answered the elder prisoner the will of god be done and as the old man slowly pronounced those words an air of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn countenance				688.2230116830212
to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation				1653.7582469084957
fortunately as d artagnan had thought it was not dangerous				7847.257209594753
you may convert to and distribute this work in any binary compressed marked up nonproprietary or proprietary form including any word processing or hypertext form				1442.7568849388188
d artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal				280.2176748793474
meanwhile it was necessary at all hazards in order to gain time to put some obstacle in the way of the execution on the following day the day appointed by the judges				3682.3049278873646
these gentlemen comminges are not prisoners returned mazarin with his ironical smile only guests but guests so precious that i have put a grating before each of their windows and bolts to their doors that they may not refuse to continue my visitors				14593.802092743845
now to the work i have in hand and after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed				1889.4817159256327
besides if they do we can easily make an excuse we came straight off a journey and are insurgents too an excuse for us				372.76600471617354
have two riding horses ready				1169.873628840894
danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed dantès and when napoleon returned to france he after the manner of mediocre minds termed the coincidence a decree of providence				4106.760296449607
shall i leave you				41.63067401415305
he replied however in a tone of deep interest i entreat you m de villefort be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy s ears				1872.3306844117328
you were going to visit monsieur de la fere said d artagnan				25.1957665723354
true to his custom of never passing anything over that it was within his power to know d artagnan looked out of the window and perceived the close red coat and brown hair of raoul				620.4823562402572
do not let us despond but wait at rueil for my conviction is that they are at rueil				6391.948910116606
it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body my eyes which i tried to open closed against my will and what will appear impossible above all to you sir i saw with my eyes shut in the spot where you are now standing issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into madame villefort s dressing room i saw i tell you silently enter a white figure valentine screamed				15996.835770915432
although he felt himself ably supported the young man was not without a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase step by step				1503.8546213953462
the count then looking over into the street saw the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and place himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over				1427.4993759890187
the curtain which had risen at the close of the scene with albert again fell and a rap was heard at the door				194.55849817008723
conspiracy chapter				76.27660873001408
yes and her husband found out that she had a fleur de lis on her shoulder cried porthos				164.50210940427647
madame broussel separated by the width of the table from her husband burst into tears and the young girls clung to their father s arms				601.9260296635082
ah to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband mercédès and to lose that hope which was the only stay of my existence at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that hope fernand replied mercédès you can not reproach me with the slightest coquetry				50407.49556300681
the procureur went out after having double locked the door				184.76182691313318
there is nobody within said bonacieux				7751.478555440033
but in that same banker s study where you very willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs i give you monthly for pocket money you must know my dear young lady that many things may be learned useful even to a girl who will not marry				15050.196808163408
all the nobility of rome will be present and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society she must go there whether she goes there or not my opinion is still the same returned albert				367.4750082521735
no i have good luck that is all				205.64058528163298
monsieur is i am sure an honest man take away that fool said the cardinal				241.694313289119
it is a beautiful house or at all events may be made so there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your excellency for the tapestried hangings are very old let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping chamber which is hung with red damask you will leave that exactly as it is bertuccio bowed				1355.7803260226399
well once returned from the country half by the protection of her cousin half through what we have personally done for her we shall obtain from the queen what we desire				8301.977985036954
an hour after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire				3539.134678321929
coquenard had seen everything				812.5726503974549
i see no one and yet the ladder didn t come down of itself no it is bazin ah				599.0126673342205
well where the devil are you going now cried athos				19.203195442610102
nevertheless had caderousse but retained his post a few minutes longer he might have caught a dim outline of something approaching from the direction of bellegarde as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and horse between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist				2783.987889268245
brava cried morcerf parodying the banker as the selection came to an end				739.718947413411
there was no response				7252.724712760119
the president rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the carriage with the general after bandaging his eyes				624.8251600043213
under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry but his conscience murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak				1025.3598082943104
perhaps my heart was weaker than the hearts of most men and i suffered more than they would have done in my place that is all the countess stopped for a moment as if gasping for breath				4287.951925448977
felton darted into the palace				2210.3850549169792
why about ten or eleven o clock shall we watch by the corpse of what use would it be				873.0790154638973
come in cried athos				7.385758954360225
bonacieux with a half smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience				4395.322240907014
a change of ideas presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleidoscope				98439.94241760498
it will suffice then to tell them that at the moment at which discouraged by so many fruitless investigations we were about to abandon our search we at length found guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend paulin paris a manuscript in folio endorsed or we do not recollect which having for title memoirs of the comte de la fère touching some events which passed in france toward the end of the reign of king louis xiii				740.6291860024436
monsieur said mademoiselle d aubigne to scarron as if she wished to join in the conversation he was engaged in with raoul do you not admire monsieur voiture s friends				525.8166930011816
the eyes of porthos were furtively cast upon this lady and then roved about at large over the nave				40978.502517375025
well this man				124.70252140326558
excellent said aramis				29.204042912835703
unfortunately the hour was badly chosen for a private conference				62596.34720197262
nothing was yet to be seen only they heard the galloping draw nearer				14570.7586190028
however i hope you will excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions my dear count replied albert i was announcing your visit to some of my friends whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me the honor to make and whom i now present to you				72.27787422139261
the inspector turned smilingly to the governor				1872.3601469393493
where stammered morcerf				878.0455897624681
give me my felt hat bernouin the valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide brim				37141.1915976409

he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural thing for him to do				1304.8151743921412
oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart tragedy weapons i own which instead of wounding sheathe their points in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly jealousy indicates affection true but i am not jealous he is of whom of debray no of you of me				98.73845253624354
one by one the several groups broke up				1216.0347499061722
and what did the cuistre pettifogger say about me i admit the word monseigneur because it rhymes with ministre minister				1754.6841286879296
monsieur morrel said valentine to the young man who was regarding her with the most intense interest my grandfather m noirtier had a thousand things to say which he told me three days ago and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you				66.38634010006818
an indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb				3463.252235072353
besides i can find my way about the city with my eyes shut i wish we were already there said d artagnan and my advice is that we reach london before daybreak even if we kill our horses come on then said athos for unless i am mistaken in my calculations we have only eight or ten leagues to go the friends urged on their horses and arrived in fact at about five o clock in the morning				408.26409359839977
have you brought your arms i what for				1141.0066474627831
you know the proverb unlucky at play lucky in love you are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its revenge				6495.889959829403

here guitant spoke to one of the subalterns asking how matters were progressing				81418.65441352327
is it my father no madame de villefort no me the former sign was repeated				2410.7542179477887
but my real treasure is not that my dear friend which awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of monte cristo it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications				113426.17146217024
hold sir said villefort do not prolong this dreadful scene				3410.6131700776273
now m de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his refusal in the first case i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of age which will be in about ten months				2655.334677109336
while we wait time will be progressing events will succeed each other things which in the evening look dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the light of morning and sometimes the utterance of one word or the lapse of a single day will reveal the most cruel calumnies calumnies did you say sir cried morcerf turning livid with rage				1447.0043990641852
she made it her business therefore to amuse the good abbess with the worldly practices of the court of france mixed with the eccentric pursuits of the king she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the lords and ladies of the court whom the abbess knew perfectly by name touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the duke of buckingham talking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little				1013.933130338858

if an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of milady he would take him in the mental disposition in which he now found himself for a messenger sent by the devil				574.2112172914988
horrible replied raoul especially in expression yes yes said de guiche a strange face but these monks are subject to such degrading practices their fasts make them pale the blows of the discipline make them hypocrites and their eyes become inflamed through weeping for the good things of this life we common folk enjoy but they have lost well said raoul the poor man will get his priest but by heaven the penitent appears to me to have a better conscience than the confessor				6162.067780378724

anyone else would have rushed on with a cry of joy				1117.9093675102333

danglars defended himself with the baseness but at the same time with the assurance of a man who speaks the truth at least in part if not wholly not for conscience sake but through fear				1234.2560355044193
all this negotiation must be carried on openly i will follow your eminence s instructions to the letter				599.2706481141382
my ten years of service have also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations for i have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the right or to the left in order to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side while it left me unharmed dear maximilian why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety				3055.2107169810984

bravo said the captain				1710.1362216465266
i acted well as a man but you have acted better than man				97.45330689776512
what cried d artagnan				8.43089297555543
the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court both in the name of morality and for the respect due to humanity				10491.631372049287
tell them to take arms to come here and to run				21332.643479813098
well while i was watching not the king as monsieur le comte thinks for i know what it is to see a man led to death and though i ought to be accustomed to the sight it always makes me ill while i was watching the masked executioner the idea came to me as i said to find out who he was				1857.9541024985874
however to teresa s great astonishment luigi remained mute and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening				578.3964498402299
the king looked around him				36.97636204493113
you know or you don t know that that is what we ask of you oh				594.3712361321739

danglars raving threw himself on the goat skin				48972.635039753666
however insignificant i am i am sure that his majesty is concerned for me and blames himself for my death be easy said d artagnan he will know all before night the little troop recommenced their march and at the end of two hours perceived a considerable body of horsemen about half a league ahead				54668.67597460122
the queen read it recognized the writing and since there were no details in it of what had occurred asked for particulars				12216.85765564972
in an instant we were on the alert but it was too late our vessel was surrounded and amongst the custom house officers i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as i was brave at the sight of any other i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues mortes				57709.03914777432
you see it makes a very respectable appearance pardieu cried d artagnan it will be a double amusing affair to save the queen with the cardinal s money you are an amiable and charming young man said mme				218.45623837346102
do you then know in what manner fernand injured dantès inquired the abbé of caderousse				639.243029502024
i do not perceive that singing masses has spoiled your voice my dear d artagnan replied aramis you understand when i was a musketeer i mounted guard as seldom as i could now when i am an abbé i say as few masses as i can				4485.16780704587
you talk of sacrilege				53210.36847844292
come barrois said the young girl take some of this lemonade i see you are coveting a good draught of it the fact is mademoiselle said barrois i am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me i can not say i should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it take some then and come back immediately barrois took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the door which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very dregs the glass which valentine had filled				15563.982804974481
you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you of am in destitution with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes and i unable to do anything in the world for her i shall die of hunger as old dantès did while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth how is that because their deeds have brought them good fortune while honest men have been reduced to misery what has become of danglars the instigator and therefore the most guilty what has become of him				29.67077950262739
it was then upon the manifestation of this astonishment that d artagnan related to him the precaution taken and how thanks to the devotion of his three friends whom he had left scattered and bleeding on the road he had succeeded in coming off with a single sword thrust which had pierced the queen s letter and for which he had repaid m de wardes with such terrible coin				7844.122154116698
oh is it you dear friends				407.54714998398515
midnight struck				1783.249789735084
the baroness was also surprised and showed her astonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon her husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations				66138.44162528028
never mind that returned the sailor i know their vessel is it a very beautiful vessel i would not wish for a better to sail round the world of what burden is she about a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather				7622.356600982542
someone has vexed you i will allow no one to annoy you you are deceived lucien i assure you replied madame danglars and what i have told you is really the case added to the ill humor you remarked but which i did not think it worth while to allude to it was evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous irritability which women frequently can not account for even to themselves or that as debray had guessed she had experienced some secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone				2121.0469873778407
then my lord then what asked mazarin				208.22887364685087
one night edmond awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him				25.86046485975418
we started a stag of ten branches				68491.06254005955
come calm yourself and reckon them up m				675.437637215798
can i be of any use to you chatillon made a sign with his hand and aramis was about to dismount when he received a violent shock twas a thrust from a sword but his cuirass turned aside the blow				2379.609271920829
what are you going to do my friend asked morrel arresting his hand				171.12186201318497
shall i give you the change my officer said the host				627.6332777307559
there was no occasion to push the door it was wide open				1478.1940053637518
immediately m de tréville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis who bore their comrade in their arms				521.9937531027664
and therefore added he quietly i have not confidence in every one the proof of which is that i have fixed upon you to escort me shall you not go with the queen no replied mazarin				481.771631022014
i turned around i looked at the trees i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the time				679.8456891697084
if we only had some one to instruct us about the physical and moral topography of this castle				3360.017245381334
her secret had each time been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her father and mother all would be lost				798.7250565027581
no no i am aware you know me but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in gold and jewellery				67581.52563804896
i am hungry that is all pardieu if that is all i am hungry too but it is not everything to be hungry one must find something to eat unless we browse on the grass like our horses ah exclaimed aramis who was not quite so indifferent to the good things of the earth as athos do you remember when we were at parpaillot the beautiful oysters that we ate and the legs of mutton of the salt marshes said porthos smacking his lips				474.9030761638616
ah this time you can not lose ground my fine friend exclaimed d artagnan				46.24740507208831
that knife give it to me for a minute only for mercy s for pity s sake				7057.458276044063
if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements aramis those of london are mine				1934.387254178985
but return to your question does mademoiselle danglars object to this marriage with m de morcerf on account of loving another i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with eugénie yes but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly intimate own now that you did question her on the subject				1105.7876649939578
d artagnan said athos taking his hand you know i love you if i had a son i could not love him better				720.244886456949
count he inquired have you any relations no sir i am alone in the world so much the worse why asked monte cristo				347.3024050450466
then the effort having exhausted her strength she fell not asleep this time but fainting on the floor				1253.2205610598446
in truth that italian puppet does not deserve the services of an honest man d artagnan was not less exact to his appointment and at half past nine o clock he entered the ante room				196.41496086079238
at five o clock the next morning she again proceeded and in three hours after entered béthune				4062.9273063632004
they then came to a massive door which after the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried with him turned heavily upon its hinges and disclosed the chamber destined for milady				590.37070675645
comminges wounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead had left a picket in the street and returned to the palais royal followed by a menacing crowd to tell his story				2895.201344166121
i will give you three replied the stranger				1779.4206652303396
of danglars yes to be sure must i say baron danglars				315.42698561329786
you should recognize him among a thousand say you continued he				199.44945319672254
oh traitors that ye are sire said athos this is not a moment for recrimination but a time to show yourself a king and a gentleman				816.1860209526927
and your business is that of a confectioner in the rue des lombards explain to me how it happens that following so peaceful a business you had such warlike inclinations why does my lord belonging to the church now receive me in the dress of an officer with a sword at his side and spurs to his boots not badly answered i faith said gondy laughing but i have you must know always had in spite of my bands warlike inclinations well my lord before i became a confectioner i myself was three years sergeant in the piedmontese regiment and before i became sergeant i was for eighteen months the servant of monsieur d artagnan the lieutenant of musketeers asked gondy				5180.417419474275
i never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two countenances				69674.54676141102
this man whom they had noticed from the first for the same reason they had themselves been remarked by others was walking in a listless way up and down the jetty				94385.97236137997
certainly all four we couldn t leave our prisoners could we ah				455.0815905282082
well go and fetch them and come to my apartment				570.5014183876762
determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the room saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance				4828.785904042284
the discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost miraculous				7232.0179500070135
it was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action from all sides				4185.07993103979
monte cristo saw him advance towards him without making a single step				1532.4752985135462
you see i am generous am i not mother but you my poor child i				1049.4998460950956
he found the door of his passage open sprang up the stairs and knocked softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey				3483.9764045411134
blaisois was in a state of great excitement he was in ecstasies				13629.643449611754
when seven o clock came dantès agony really began				1853.6083338572773
the mountaineers are bonapartists sire then murmured louis he was well informed				34457.73518087053
he therefore narrated to the prince what they had seen from the inn at mazingarbe				115719.24045627812
my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen and he as usual has refused				3195.31464267977
on their road they perceived lord winter marching at the head of his regiment				68993.75805582515
it is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime yes				1387.8966540370566
then they returned to the rospoli palace but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared the two windows hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited				12342.701999909425
what is the matter then he asked himself trembling more than the wind swayed cloth he was holding back				674.1569992265466
he found him kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer book				8249.431049425566
that health which excellent my dear friend better than ever				1847.6236142957341
that worthy prince				1081.7818713733063
and who cares now about yanina which was taken as long ago as the year or that just shows the meanness of this slander				68317.21064387876
scarcely had they entered when she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor				1451.1433200951017
i trust all this will soon be taken away bertuccio bowed				1371.5211452184174
i broke my word it is true but what signifies that				661.7749205548974
there is a horse while on the contrary the hundred pistoles feed their master but how shall we get back upon our lackey s horses pardieu				14928.803471419866
a man bringing a letter from oliver cromwell said mazarin				250.16828395037814
ah very well replied the cardinal quickly				1549.528524690631
it was three o clock at a quarter past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships it was a clear profit of francs				1477.134983585582
and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all night grief has stunned him replied d avrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the procureur s study				2250.2460003094657
three persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were villefort valentine and the old servant of whom we have already spoken				6750.458087389473
this time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted				1884.6388848087338
fight on all occasions				17295.79634736798
athos did not move				3254.1598141779505
she was still exceedingly handsome				11737.0782845206
at this spot so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his heart beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his sight and had he not clung for support to one of the trees he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there				785.7774896308096
edmond started				1675.971975047714
ah sir				242.08162886439897
why do you remember when it forgets				83833.0151012685
she uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger and maximilian began to laugh				2394.702877006223
your death said he oh no you are too charming a mistress to allow me to consent to lose you thus after i have had the happiness to possess you only a single time				693.4309904845805
andrea cavalcanti or rather m benedetto is nothing more nor less than an assassin sir i do not deny the justice of your correction but the more severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man the more deeply will you strike our family				1611.5636124865844
in a quarter of an hour let every one be in bed and snoring these two men then went toward the compartment in which grimaud was secreted opened the door entered and shut it after them				105.6571232985898
yes sir you have not been long detained no				551.4007468374245
thanks to the cares of mousqueton the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior				4255.812414841027
i know you to be a man of resolution and your services well directed instead of leading you to ill might be very advantageous to you				62.77215511351481
after supper when they are perfected i will communicate my plans to you so porthos sat down to table without another word and ate with an appetite that did honor to the confidence that was ever inspired in him by d artagnan s inventive imagination				2992.0372625894192
sir resumed villefort we are thinking of marrying valentine had the old man s face been moulded in wax it could not have shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there				786.7762924624977
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for indeed i did not think of you in the least at the moment you admire candor and will now be satisfied i hope but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on account of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into eugénie became uneasy				6979.022470858418
the prince awaited him there				594.1238634555732
i don t speak of my brother				2163.9166059538206
if the four friends were assembled at one of these moments a word thrown forth occasionally with a violent effort was the share athos furnished to the conversation				573.7779471324932
he sat down by the side of the moat buried his face in his hands and reflected				2069.175170075898
he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman was really mme				200.7341607071881
she had had for an instant an inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal and relate everything to him but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the part of athos				174.53513434038138
then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew as if with regret				15064.39860787012
as for her she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt upon her lips and repeated blaspheming that terrible name of god by whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know him				36.65862766276882
oh mercy mercy monsieur what i require is that justice be done				1458.6760951710892
he saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy				41396.234670466656
you will make some desirable acquaintances and from time to time you can call upon me just to tell me how you are getting on and to say whether i can be of further service to you d artagnan stranger as he was to all the manners of a court could not but perceive a little coldness in this reception				5203.907922496031
since you have no further interrogations to make leave me i beseech you she said				356.5887294557566
de chevreuse and consequently the queen				416.0937069322408
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused				5631.909145484902
prepare yourself maximilian he said with a smile we leave paris tomorrow have you nothing more to do there asked morrel				255.9917032539302
does this oath satisfy you yes said they all with one accord				44423.36815653774
with him then you must have seen some of his musketeers all those he is in the habit of receiving replied milady for whom this conversation began to have a real interest				2610.136860972545
m danglars dined with me i know it to avoid meeting him my mother and i left town but he met here m andrea cavalcanti your italian prince not so fast m andrea only calls himself count calls himself do you say yes calls himself is he not a count what can i know of him				32.10242063679212
like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength because i am a weak and vain man fond of the tender kind and thankful glances of my fellow creatures				2402.3519829634156
the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty five years but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time				709.6200532645598
on the contrary replied aramis your opinion will be very valuable				115790.11228617777
i must confess to you count said danglars that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of europe and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me				74.9086519898844
thank god you have come eh				2458.0629652393
and here he comes by jupiter				6730.177548189926
d artagnan in his turn sprang to the ground and just at the moment when the coachman alarmed at not seeing his master fell back a step he seized him by his collar with the left whilst with the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his breast				1369.0075432219828
he then concluded it must be an assassin				9247.572075688107
when there is some idea of being resuscitated you say he s a scoundrel an impudent fellow a miser a bad master				1338.4632426311719
if the league which threatened france triumphed all his influence would be lost				803.1453371686663
lord de winter did the same				1197.6483626945328
why i have as much money as i want mother assunta always furnishes me when i ask for it				74.55405189989338
ma foi there is no hurry				22607.46202447914
chapter xi				18181.828641207438
this lady was the daughter of nicholas de camus who arrived in paris with twenty francs in his pocket became secretary of state and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine millions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty thousand for himself				186.67838751059574
the two piastres that luigi received every month from the count of san felice s steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and gold hairpins				76335.99747774159
my mother was a christian and she prayed				23117.596979072296
you can sleep here yes do stay added la carconte in a tremulous voice we will take every care of you no i must sleep at beaucaire				34342.02752863812
milady had already rung her bell and roused the whole hôtel				1786.7531426997325
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some iron instrument attacking the stones				5963.545168540194
pray go valentine said m de villefort and see what this new fancy of your grandfather s is valentine rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the door when m de villefort altered his intention				16601.668035606694
drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all one s wit and cool judgment i drunk said caderousse well that s a good one				766.2610318714451
he s my friend and this morning offered to share his money with me as i shared mine with him				33.06697062376481
madame he said kneeling look upon the unhappy man at your feet				826.1125897803868
i know you are not rich madame coquenard and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them				104.89774826697672
but lord de winter makes cruel accusations against you				48.42865418581398
at the third he fell again				288.6366879710537
the young girl was very pensive but seeing luigi so cheerful she on her part assumed a smiling air which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion				2996.6348120975335

the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily				11831.739560978367
athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask assistance				3744.1043121639077

as for myself i shall be proud to face the bullets or even the rope in company with you athos for you have never seemed to me so grand as you are to day d artagnan said nothing but after having gnawed the flower stalk he began to bite his nails				14327.1411964244
five hundred roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married				12867.78850372323

are you mad to talk to me thus said buckingham				1515.936445580587
the same silence and then ere the host could oppose his design grimaud seized a pair of pincers he perceived in a corner and forced the bolt				9004.358182658698
as we have said the inspector from discretion and that he might not disturb the abbé faria s pupil in his researches had seated himself in a corner and was reading le drapeau blanc				28158.15014694041

back shouted d artagnan or you are dead two shots were the reply to this threat but the assailants attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they were upon them a third pistol shot was heard aimed by d artagnan and one of his adversaries fell				2746.6664968251507
you surprise me exclaimed the monarch				16710.60374724409

monte cristo stopped and examined it attentively				11807.988830958535
all these successive accidents were perhaps the result of chance but they might be the fruits of a plot				23169.50891841964
athos had been out since six o clock				977.9382690499984
the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio the other following an opposite direction was about to round the island of corsica				5883.77904281029

only as our gascon was not easily intimidated or rather thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear he placed himself haughtily in front of messieurs the guards and waited with his hand on his hip in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty				2063.752699740542

without doubt he recognized d artagnan for he became deadly pale doubtless the musketeer knew him for his hair stood up on his head				363.4181376529617
his recital finished the abbé reflected long and earnestly				5256.174180793078
if i had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time count instead of only for the second said madame de villefort if i had had the honor of being your friend instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to dinner and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal a thousand thanks madame replied monte cristo but i have an engagement which i can not break				71398.6990353433

well what is the matter my dear asked the gentleman whose name the lady s agitation revealed tell me what is the matter oh lucien can i confide in you of course you know you can do so				368.4164735195448
and she fell on her knees at the same time holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his presence and for the second time haydée stopped overcome by such violent emotion that the perspiration stood upon her pale brow and her stifled voice seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and lips				453.95718686743754

these gardeners are the most careless people in the world in bringing the horse out to the water they ve allowed him to walk over the border d artagnan began to smile				547.7672693799874
but what astonished franz who had treated gaetano s description as a fable was the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself				189.94320043669234
tis not too warm to walk resumed d artagnan				31.67930666176985
see if he is still in the same place athos turned around with an effort the sight of the young man was evidently painful to him and there he still was in fact on the rock the beacon shedding around him as it were a doubtful aureole				46253.47433897821
suddenly he arose lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the bed				742.9431628710475
but do not be uneasy even if the powerful voice of nature should be silent you can not well mistake him he will enter by this door				178.9079680454643
this point of union was noirtier and it was he who had just sent for morrel with the request that the latter would lose no time in coming to him a command which morrel obeyed to the letter to the great discomfiture of barrois				2330.2065187221115
you don t love me				36.98891794904534

on the following morning at five o clock d artagnan arose and descending to the kitchen without help asked among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to us for some oil some wine and some rosemary and with his mother s recipe in his hand composed a balsam with which he anointed his numerous wounds replacing his bandages himself and positively refusing the assistance of any doctor d artagnan walked about that same evening and was almost cured by the morrow				1893.975709691901
of aramis yes since he has become an abbé				443.7985616475245

therefore d artagnan was going to ask leave of absence of m de tréville confiding to him candidly the importance of his departure when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three friends that the king was about to set out for paris with an escort of twenty musketeers and that they formed part of the escort				2439.0365113813414
at this moment planchet brought out athos s horse the musketeer leaped lightly into the saddle				1907.5473928837084

at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms after giving her orders many guests were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the count for owing to the good taste of mercédès one was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in case of need				7300.712007051546

d artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of battle				1237.792326640078
but morrel saw nothing he had grasped the hand of valentine and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets				72065.54597279865

is it as good now oh yes replied andrea laughing				1899.6585085459358
on looking around him however as he could perceive no threatening object as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger as the bench was comfortably covered with a well stuffed cushion as the wall was ornamented with a beautiful cordova leather and as large red damask curtains fastened back by gold clasps floated before the window he perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated and he began to turn his head to the right and the left upward and downward				70289.61970542476
i wish to consult you about some thing do so do you think it is time for us to enter the service but are you not still in the service you d artagnan i mean active service				2015.8392209160527

in five minutes three were slightly wounded one on the hand another on the ear by the defender of the stair who himself remained intact a piece of skill which was worth to him according to the rules agreed upon three turns of favor				1710.2348947291086
the sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm				1299.9953255642927

yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm mercédès shuddered and fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to albert and you appear to have some singular prejudices				62682.96704484093

we are leaving paris and when our journey is paid we shall have francs left the blood mounted to the temples of debray who held a million in his pocket book and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had contained two women one of whom justly dishonored had left it poor with francs under her cloak while the other unjustly stricken but sublime in her misfortune was yet rich with a few deniers				21342.838456640446
juxon replied with a sign which meant that he knew no more than aramis about it				82.59577668510718

the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards				23142.876261192236
sir cried the groom they have traversed six leagues and have only been unsaddled half an hour half an hour s rest is enough replied the gascon				1165.2143753456112
were you not already rich enough you who possess nearly a million				13749.412477751546
i should affirm the culpability and i deny it said tréville				1217.6779959486316
he had doubtless seen all				199.00466869283045
acknowledge that if albert is brave he can not be a coward he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise doubtless doubtless said morrel but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave today as he was yesterday you will breakfast with me will you not morrel said the count to turn the conversation				566.5532074293202
i have made a bargain morrel looked at the count with surprise				1997.8269995590124

the next day at the usual hour the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest				1161.1144805599818
well i will certainly drink to their health with all my heart but i will not drink alone and d artagnan went among those guardsmen with whom he had formed greater intimacy than with the others to invite them to enjoy with him this present of delicious anjou wine which had been sent him from villeroy				30535.490145759904
a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain				7144.756883770112
really my dear count you seem to throw a sort of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking dream				1402.6258687995203
twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in england she was already married in france				557.6419653636436

we shall find him changed into a broken down old man with garnet nose and eyes that slobber we shall find him extended on some lawn whence he will look at us with a languid eye and peradventure will not recognize us				365.549782391945
yes and that s all settled exclaimed caderousse who by a last effort of intellect had followed the reading of the letter and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail				80902.70205616446
good said mazarin i am glad to see that his majesty has been brought up with a hatred of dissimulation why do you say that asked the queen almost timidly				2623.88356039772

a double line of carbineers placed on each side of the door of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten feet wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet				814.7946941478001
the throng was terrific and it was not till after much pushing and some fighting that our friends reached their destination				9946.68095019538
the mask and beard became you very well and as to the axe i do not think it would be out of keeping even at this moment				499.48294622323743
only he is not quite sure about the women for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of statues the two young men looked at morcerf as if to say are you mad or are you laughing at us and i also said morrel thoughtfully have heard something like this from an old sailor named penelon ah cried albert it is very lucky that m morrel comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth my dear albert said debray what you tell us is so extraordinary ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of them they have no time				702.2877522804954
it is twelve o clock maximilian thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the evening or tomorrow morning				399.8573828569452

so call me mercédès if you please we must excuse our worthy neighbor caderousse said dantès he is so easily mistaken so then the wedding is to take place immediately m dantès said danglars bowing to the young couple				154569.27186374768
what is it				75.02522300329588
let us unfold them first and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his eminence than the others				1106.0133641414648
this is the case said d artagnan this is your brother madeleine you don t know him perhaps but i know him he has arrived from amsterdam				64492.154430080554
it is true we plundered them a little when we took them and i will even confess that it is their purse that monsieur du vallon and i draw on in our nightly play				3236.2035610185167
the stranger whom as yet dantès knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no means to be expected in a person of his years and light and steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard climbed from the table to the outstretched hands of dantès and from them to his shoulders then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his head between the upper bars of the window so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom				11331.529206256053
i stabbed to the heart the headsman of bethune without mercy or pity and he was the least guilty of you all with these words the young man went out and descended the stairs with sufficient calmness to pass unobserved then upon the lowest landing place he passed tony leaning over the balustrade waiting only for a call from his master to mount to his room				201.00340302309297
mordaunt in fact while defending himself had manoeuvred so as to reach the secret door by which cromwell had left had felt for the knob with his left hand pressed it and disappeared				614.1571823137863
all these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as they have since done in fact all that had happened with the exception of the story of the diamond which certainly did wear an air of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few hours sleep				842.3186366414728
this noble entrance however in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse				64338.57630399858
alas no said mme				36.84038133809692
she was walking with her nurse marceline in the place where the woodmen cut the wood when passing on horseback i stopped				1581.0036765394907
those who took me from my father and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in order to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in possession of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible				890.0493688117012
i yes you said the count at the same time advancing towards andrea and slipping a packet of bank notes into the young man s hand				214.63725416714917
the count must feel sure that franz recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them				106.92893341989398
speak quickly friend the man said in a low voice i wish i wish you to spare me the walk back to paris				471.51325232131626
well here s the case here s where the saddle hurts me as we french say				1336.4122711311466
the count came towards him				42.89330992616891
i saw the lamp ascend and leave me in darkness then i heard the well known creaking of the door although i had heard that door open but twice				3916.168808524036
i respect your convictions and whilst we fight for opposite sides let us remain friends				442.05001627458176
he then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see in the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he re opened them and stood motionless with amazement				3112.182029074046
it is my mistress you love you told me so just now and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason the second reason monsieur the chevalier replied kitty emboldened by the kiss in the first place and still further by the expression of the eyes of the young man is that in love everyone for herself then only d artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette				12144.510893330056
parry too started and stopped reading				17724.048176242006
coquenard they arose slowly from the table folded their napkins more slowly still bowed and retired				879.0878956131775
if you prefer any other place said athos in his persuasive voice choose for yourselves this place if monsieur d herblay can procure the key is the best that we can have was the answer				826.4660126566939
the corpse of madame de villefort was stretched across the doorway leading to the room in which edward must be those glaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony				74806.64313961095

but peppino did not answer				917.6748622037895
yes replied caderousse little albert but then to be able to instruct her child continued the abbé she must have received an education herself				1900.1785248450763
noirtier closed his right eye				2656.9178516871452
two hours passed away without anything fresh happening				96285.7605896787
then on his return give him that card and this sealed paper				1140.983796568178
and bazin asked athos				8.001831309973234
and therefore marie came seeking hospitality from the guest of the good abbé and not from the good abbé himself and that cavalier that guest that nobleman who arrived before she came it was i the comte de la fere said athos rising and bowing respectfully to the duchess de chevreuse				2092.588854345144
now if they believed us they laughed in order to insult us if they did not believe it they insulted us all the more				1531.4978786670106
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket				58907.49672729768
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen feet from where i intended				14255.138849400344
in short you will find your father a very presentable person i assure you ah sir you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that i have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all defects he is a millionaire his income is francs then said the young man with anxiety i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable position one of the most agreeable possible my dear sir he will allow you an income of livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in paris then in that case i shall always choose to remain there you can not control circumstances my dear sir man proposes and god disposes andrea sighed				5682.954179744336
i tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle field you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons				78227.30533717306
nevertheless he continued in the tone of one who gives wholesome advice i think it is better not to make them then said raoul this monsieur scarron is a poet yes you are warned vicomte				1982.3157053655984
monsieur d artagnan said mazarin you are worth your weight in gold chapter liii				5622.212093461
la ramee cast an inquiring look around him and observing the same signs of antipathy between the prisoner and his guardian he smiled in token of his inward satisfaction				3671.1125629538747
scarcely however had he touched edmond s hand when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the house				501.8263228217164
the day had begun to break when athos arose and dressed himself				174.34299080772163
the carriage rolled rapidly onward				69222.8499334792
its purple visage and its violet colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet				817.6701743168276
i don t say resumed the guard that coysel is not a sorcerer but i say that if his prophecy gets wind it s a sure way to prevent it s coming true how so why in this way if coysel says loud enough for the cardinal to hear him on such or such a day such a prisoner will escape tis plain that the cardinal will take measures of precaution and that the prisoner will not escape good lord said another guard who might have been thought asleep on a bench but who had lost not a syllable of the conversation do you suppose that men can escape their destiny				13894.24975282551
it was granted and was to take place after her morning s levee at which in accordance with his rights of birth he was entitled to be present				6134.772811323021
everyone spoke harangued and vociferated swearing cursing and consigning the cardinal and his guards to all the devils				59737.542241942014
we came merely to inquire after your health and to take your orders as to my health since it has stood five years of prison with monsieur de chavigny to boot tis excellent				18821.91670866583
it is humiliating said he thus to receive money given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail				3211.9349733629983
follow me sir and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance				3905.1034687851866
yes continued the cardinal				278.02480668992996
at this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the opening dantès seized his gun sprang through the opening and mounted the stair				80184.05234673082
no albert take my advice				5119.985603063447
come come said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop				1666.4665840094453
he was in hunting costume covered with dust wearing large boots and holding a whip in his hand				200.3441084496195
his boots were covered with dust and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to england				901.59538149673
by that means all our secrets will remain in the family insolent cried milady and as if acted upon by a spring she bounded toward the baron who awaited her attack with his arms crossed but nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword				1375.3477501982582
i know not where i have left my hat and in all probability i should have been left with my hat had the coadjutor not arrived in time to rescue me ah indeed said the queen it would have much astonished me if that low cur with his distorted legs had not been mixed up with all this madame said la meilleraie do not say too much against him before me for the service he rendered me is still fresh very good said the queen be as grateful as you like it does not implicate me you are here safe and sound that is all i wished for you are not only welcome but welcome back yes madame but i only came back on one condition that i would transmit to your majesty the will of the people the will exclaimed the queen frowning				17976.723089524123
i suppose you mean continued d artagnan				20.648432097407525
picture to yourself a pretty coach house at the right hand side where the ladders are kept				12419.00053017506
we will not expose your eminence to the chances of war come answered mazarin i see it will be necessary for me to capitulate before a siege yes the conditions will be better than afterward ah my lord				279.3812731324205
send me the keeper of the seals séguier and that man what has your eminence done with him what man asked the cardinal				286.2337695930765
cromwell is mighty mazarin is tricky but i would rather have to do with them than with the late monsieur mordaunt ah said porthos it is very pleasant to be able to say the late monsieur mordaunt my faith yes said d artagnan				74.23719327617306
but what detains her				143.88236384497458
the bishop affected to speak in a loud voice before every one of their previous interview				6603.252765345259
chapter lxiii				10030.919418859636
obey said noirtier s intelligent eye				2814.64434655555
that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated				17603.83808969391
absolution comes not from him who administers it but from god				603.8875610337187
all the ladies rose and there was a profound silence				501.84881653296947
thus i shall rejoice when mademoiselle eugénie perceives i am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has millions monte cristo smiled				499.6770941492473
because answered the gascon we were sent porthos and i by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell instead of fighting for cromwell we have served charles i not the same thing by any means				4821.639494099771
bonacieux was going that was to follow her				170.31148617995763
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the darkness and dawn came but she knew not that it was day				432.02928108714843
you are dressed it is now my turn to dress myself teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the count of san felice s daughter				1772.5602750876253
a bark all cried together				1392.8431428326455
so at least the duke believed but sleep is a capricious fairy and it is precisely when one invokes her presence that she is most likely to keep him waiting				989.3271922816393
milady faltered d artagnan and fainted a second time				685.3313597707904
poor girl said debray like the rest paying an involuntary tribute to the sad event poor girl so young so rich so beautiful				1708.680436328605
yes we are severed there is the great the distressing truth				1399.8970489574247
my dear bazin said d artagnan i am delighted to see with what wonderful composure you can tell a lie even in church sir replied bazin i have been taught by the good jesuit fathers that it is permitted to tell a falsehood when it is told in a good cause so far well said aramis we are dying of hunger				1550.3525868849754
what do you intend to do				1221.858754662489
do you come from the end of the world said monte cristo you a journalist the husband of renown				42562.52938221431
don t question me i beg of you but lend me a horse my stables are at your command viscount but you will kill yourself by riding on horseback				2807.3820874828957
that s another thing said d artagnan and i should not mind waiting in london a whole year for a chance of meeting this mordaunt in question				590.5221789361055
the queen my sister is no longer queen my child				1582.534041894506
he will very probably come of his own accord said morcerf				734.1213172638924
while albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived morrel who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye				3231.6606559620855
i beg you therefore to excuse if you find anything in me too turkish too italian or too arabian				162286.25199331235
thanks to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into orders he was always clothed in black as became the servant of a churchman				9655.467530044738
yes monseigneur but i told her she was wrong to talk about such things and that his eminence was incapable hold your tongue				1425.6599905133353
ask him then for the written order				4513.935288683185
should it not be found in possession of either father or son then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said dantès on board the pharaon how dreadful said mercédès passing her hand across her brow moist with perspiration and that letter i bought it for two hundred thousand francs madame said monte cristo but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you and the result of that letter you well know madame was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted				48924.41362180752
perhaps if i employed my strength against women i might perchance find them weaker than myself and consequently conquer them but it is with men that i struggle and i am but a woman to them				109.64867168188457
we are lost said d artagnan in the ear of athos				186.93991914234377
i warn you that i will never again work in the dark and that i will know not only to what i expose myself but for whom i expose myself an illustrious person sends you an illustrious person awaits you				51.2838324457661
the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier				87779.36338428441
we must go replied villefort offering his arm				1306.8263782885695
noirtier and valentine had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission				6097.3326830118485
doctor every son of woman is born to suffer and to die i am content to suffer and to await death beware said m d avrigny it may come slowly you will see it approach after having struck your father your wife perhaps your son villefort suffocating pressed the doctor s arm				1256.7206976512614
the two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people and the entire life of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair i have regretted that i was not a man that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis and the more madame said monte cristo as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his poisons but they also made them a dagger				10233.474282381643
you are pale and agitated sir replied the young man it is on account of an accident which has happened to our little neighbor to mademoiselle de la valliere asked athos quickly				1387.7232730851847
but you have been traveling these four days as you told me yourself				974.2278442655684
what said villefort do you mean to say that valentine is not interested in your will no sir said the notary whose interest had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this extraordinary and picturesque scene what appeared so impossible to me an hour ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid will provided it be read in the presence of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the notary in the presence of the witnesses				7008.562973324812
besides we are men and everything considered it is our lot to risk our lives but she asked he in an undertone				17807.270335328154
bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of béthune with milady her mortal enemy				1127.4823147232728
but this time instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his horse and advanced to meet d artagnan				74.50671414523912
tenacem propositi virum				63462.87529733843
you are a man of taste				2637.7542274382863
i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers				51480.923394780315
two angelic faces				7943.4768892122365
i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to francs				1338.148632710559
speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the truth the whole truth i do not know never may know the persons of whom you are about to speak besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to man and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man this positive assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage				2722.4447080620866
why i did not expect to see you before tomorrow my dear albert replied franz i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian women				2804.3436267867437
we are invited replied d artagnan to pass the night with m groslow				2648.2763572271
well let me see what can you want that begins with n				147532.6703318632
strength and sagacity continued				4256.672937534927
you know the same thing was done for saint stephen of florence saint george constantinian of parma and even for the order of malta				72035.3124099677
for the rest if any one of you have further or better counsel to expound i will listen to him with the greatest pleasure three curates remained those of st merri st sulpice and st eustache				6394.680428793695
as the eleventh hour struck he entered with a swaggering air attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions				1526.9550158892291
villefort again groaned with anguish and despair				1111.1122687871455
m bonacieux who was ignorant that d artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of meung related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster m de laffemas whom he never ceased to designate during his account by the title of the cardinal s executioner and expatiated at great length upon the bastille the bolts the wickets the dungeons the gratings the instruments of torture				11929.82625515486
here it is at last he said not without some trouble though yes was the answer but it has lost nothing by waiting as he said this the man came towards edmond who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence				8285.913342724913
no my friend replied athos in his gentle but decided voice we came here to defend king charles we have but ill defended him it remains for us to save him to save the king said d artagnan looking at aramis as he had looked at athos				165.36083718778866
alas her emotions were wholly personal she was thinking only of villefort s departure				4931.65724891798
that shoots me said the swiss				3771.4873448368317
planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier and d artagnan toward the rue férou				21383.99340089851
why she inquired in a hoarse voice did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said caderousse with a shudder why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the woman with an expression impossible to describe i thought it was for something else woman woman why do you have such ideas cried caderousse or if you have them why don t you keep them to yourself well said la carconte after a moment s pause you are not a man what do you mean added caderousse				446.05102424330227
for a half league they proceeded thus the cannon shot sounding so near that they expected at each discharge to hear the hum of the balls				4210.822214684109
another queen in want of help				2965.476296715752
and that you alone amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your brothers for you have said so observed villefort in a tone that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect no not perfect was the count s reply only impenetrable that s all				186.91620943268333
now valentine i firmly believe that he knew of my wish to possess this horse and that he lost expressly to give me the means of procuring him my dear maximilian you are really too fanciful you will not love even me long				2770.3480707460008
the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene				3001.697413911354
if all the prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital chance of escaping the scheme is well known said the inspector and the abbé s plan has not even the merit of originality then turning to faria i inquired if you are well fed said he				609.4167113584884
that s it said d artagnan you monsieur le comte de la fere to the right of monsieur groslow				2699.999045863309
without uttering a word they bandaged his eyes with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion				14578.639644513922
it was mordaunt with the order in his hand				194.6257700205845
besides it has perhaps been her majesty s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly				63520.70100906083
she is to correspond with nobody she is to speak to no one but you if you will do her the honor to address a word to her that is sufficient my lord				276.52232661155574
i am myself a frenchman				8319.422447297864
then she ventured to open her eyelids and glance over her extended arm				1250.8963317564076
we have nothing to fear from those who love us you speak very suddenly of love monsieur said the young woman shaking her head				365.4389394908214
mother he said turning towards mercédès this is m debray secretary of the minister for the interior once a friend of mine how once stammered debray what do you mean i say so m debray because i have no friends now and i ought not to have any				9825.933988773937
all we can now do is to wait				3622.465134487869
well la ramee who is a gourmand sees his pates thinks them more attractive than those of pere marteau and proposes to me that i shall try them				112.75419566753374
he leaped with planchet into the boat and five minutes after they were on board				7708.507884314265
the carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter and had gained for the place the appellation of the little versailles				69361.09337660577
the contract was read during a profound silence				503.86441055478934
it was warm work we were in a place where it was not very cold replied porthos giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him				28.029597712243135
porthos murmured d artagnan look well at that priest yes said porthos i see him				27.289255243665348
kitty entered to bring some sherbet				80471.0960137327
if they had discovered milady s retreat three were to remain on guard the fourth was to return to béthune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide to the four friends				514.1480569049683
then everything was still excepting that valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied				67869.58823776673
however we shall see				815.9015742316158
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that m morrel left on old dantès chimney piece and which you tell me is still in your hands caderousse more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt				5197.499890462993
you see said the young man with an air of sorrowful resignation to faria that god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you				63.50031367060767
he had been raised by circumstances to the rank of a confidant to his master				1362.8804653071622
my mind appeared to strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which i could not rouse myself				759.4591280846189
stop there madame for this can not last				3113.520888619084
does anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo he comes possibly from the holy land and one of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead sea i think i can assist your researches said maximilian				499.2062669849042
i am ready				1281.3777520722936
it is well madame i believe your oath no no read exclaimed the queen indignantly read i command you for i am resolved that everything shall be finished to night and never will i recur to this subject again				277.43310303613964
la jeune amélie left it three quarters of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica				5720.52243177034
i will go i will go d artagnan took the soldier s arquebus made him go on before him and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword				1371.1000388730797
captain gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma				48771.568117732466
anne of austria took two steps forward				1116.605196179116
edmond smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best friend if indeed he had any friend left could recognize him he could not recognize himself				181.74849652170948
they wish for secrecy since we are to converse in a private room				180.30832334314917

and now said the queen we are forgetting one very necessary thing what is that madame money mme				182.8825575634088
what design can i have why then not let me out by the door what would be the advantage of waking the porter ah reverend sir tell me do you wish me dead i wish what god wills but swear that you will not strike me as i go down cowardly fool what do you intend doing with me i ask you what can i do				1307.7146593562493

the presence of my daughter and myself in france is already irksome to him much more so would be that of the king				511.15329754266685
really captain groslow you are too much in fortune s way				876.0757973343524
who could suppose that a sensible man could leave his house france his ward a charming youth for we saw him in the camp to fly to the aid of a rotten worm eaten royalty which is going to crumble one of these days like an old hovel				79961.83467622392
the grand manner of athos had left its mark on grimaud				968.1307636919184
let us save them half of their journey and without caring whether he were followed or not he set off his regiment which bore the name of the regiment of corinth from the name of his archbishopric darted after him and began the fight				3575.9421102513297
both as this double precaution indicated had an interest in not being recognized				34776.676736840884
when the grave was formed the father embraced her first and then the lover afterwards one taking the head the other the feet they placed her in the grave				25662.65180957308
so after a thousand questions which met with only a word in reply la ramee fascinated by this sobriety in speech rubbed his hands and engaged grimaud				1017.9277629022502
you have often heard me speak of them have you not my friend yes but i confess i always thought you jested with such things				2578.0124124846816
thou hast no confidence in me				79.14183081125458
poor athos said he he will never guess what all this means				5025.703621859728
ah said the coadjutor you are avaricious my good fellow the mendicant sighed and threw down the bag				10813.77567840502
on the morrel returned he was awaited by his family with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great things				2398.7988858164126
with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into that of the maid and quick as lightning he slammed to the door and placed all his weight against it while kitty pushed the bolts				63083.26552942907
please to know monsieur porthos said she that my strongbox the strongbox of a procurator s wife though it may be is better filled than those of your affected minxes that doubles the offense said porthos disengaging his arm from that of the procurator s wife for if you are rich madame coquenard then there is no excuse for your refusal when i said rich replied the procurator s wife who saw that she had gone too far you must not take the word literally				66607.03459258331
this scene so enchanted the duke that at the moment he forgave grimaud for his part in it but on reflection he hated him more and more being convinced he had some evil motive for his conduct				21427.98629400748
the nails too were turning blue				11760.675168359667
among the groups which flocked towards the family vault château renaud recognized morrel who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew trees				3197.347831369201
what is become of them you are very generous gentlemen of the guards said athos full of rancor for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day				396.658653344566
you have seen nothing that resembles him because he works by secret springs and moves by hidden ways				74986.63910059184
bertuccio cried he striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong				14892.713110714152
here is my pass countersigned said the latter				6111.129509889259
then he had run to the train impetuous as a man who is excited by revenge and full of confidence as are those whom god blinds he had set fire to the wick of nitre				44089.644575541
it is men whom i should hold responsible and i will hold them responsible be seated juxon said the king falling upon his knees				1499.0556153669193
oh no				291.2766465239029
for my part i think what they say is very well said and quite worthy of two gentlemen when you please monsieur said athos putting himself on guard				1010.7293392938485
the countess g wished to revive the subject of the count but franz announced he had something far newer to tell her and in spite of albert s demonstrations of false modesty he informed the countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days				488.7530432856811
what do you want said my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with characters of gold				1993.9097862772805
we must leave you said monte cristo				185.02120284180288
one might have fancied that athos had educated him with the express forethought of such a great event				10862.572268156779
dantès inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings				54842.04217816491
on your return you were received by an august personage and i perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you d artagnan placed his hand upon the queen s diamond which he wore and quickly turned the stone inward but it was too late				2086.5627076640417
wait madame continued athos what remains for me to tell you is even more strange than what i have narrated monsieur said madame de chevreuse i believe you are a sorcerer i am prepared for anything				2467.3117477894148
well i take you with me we conceal ourselves and wait together but i shall not be allowed to go i am almost a prisoner as they believe that i go in consequence of an order from the cardinal no one will believe you anxious to follow me well well				487.08930078132397
i detest him				29.21791607750394
perhaps he had come to tell captain gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new master				1337.4373637334509
this way constance				3188.015591761742
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet				9955.78208388492
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle				49470.018865365084
had already placed his hand on the knob of the door at the noise of m de tréville s entrance he turned round				6158.25504326797
but said d artagnan i trust that you honorably sent them back to monsieur le cardinal ah yes said aramis toward him i should be very likely to practice such delicacy of sentiment				61051.326954784934
take a last farewell sir of her sad remains take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever				4083.838496398643
is the world filled with tigers and crocodiles yes and remember that two legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the others never mind let us go on with all my heart				411.231949641864
no one answered to his first knocking				145589.73302771183
he again struck his pickaxe into the earth and encountered the same resistance but not the same sound				6660.382470852288
well that tends to confirm my own ideas said franz that the countess s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason				4100.232747892644
the matter was to ascertain by reconnoitering how the enemy guarded this bastion				3028.6347920110356
chapter xxxviii				37895.34141009989
one question first				798.5232252609528
the injured man had recovered his senses				2089.222910086475
as for me answered porthos i wish my lord cardinal in order to do honor to my house which gives him an asylum would in remembrance of this adventure erect my estate into a barony with a promise to confer that order on one of my particular friends whenever his majesty next creates peers you know sir that before receiving the order one must submit proofs my friends will submit them				90.05907734274061
yes yes replied dantès eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of things and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me that is altogether a different and more serious matter responded the abbé				437.4845260132388
and does the husband of this frightful creature still live said aramis				105.51212490571022
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt				13582.113959129543
i faith aramis believe me there is little left to regret				14988.376634927443
it is well madame said mazarin nothing can gainsay such testimony sir replied the queen closing the coffer and leaning her hand upon it if there is anything to be said it is that i have always been ungrateful to the brave men who saved me that i have given nothing to that gallant officer d artagnan you were speaking of just now but my hand to kiss and this diamond as she spoke she extended her beautiful hand to the cardinal and showed him a superb diamond which sparkled on her finger				1895.9654199276615
i do not wish you to be seen leaving our interview must be kept secret mordaunt followed bernouin who led him through the adjacent chamber and left him with a doorkeeper showing him the way out				536.9443156715608
it is you monsieur d artagnan she said fixing a gaze full of melancholy interest on the countenance of the officer and i know you well				498.208449288975
have i by any means displeased you				39.09384666309298
have i arrived at the moment when you were drawing up an indictment for a capital crime villefort tried to smile				542.9131631421095
holland loved her and she responded to his love madame de chevreuse was not queen murmured anne of austria overcome in spite of herself by the expression of so profound a passion				2951.2090334360178
around a broken down carriage the people were uttering imprecations whilst the persons who had attempted to escape were made prisoners that is to say an old man and two women				2626.4747509318504
d artagnan said nothing but twirled his mustache with a peculiar gesture which showed that his fine gascon humor was awake				11548.909262340741
i have replied the duke a way of descending from the ramparts what a rope ladder yes but answered la ramee trying to laugh a ladder of ropes can t be sent around a ball like a letter no but it may be sent in something else in something else in something else				2273.75725153476
there she made a fresh sign of silence and opened a second door concealed by tapestry				77544.10438682076
what in the devil is the matter with you my friend said porthos				111.26067989860806
i buy those horses he said to the groom				13895.124319231832
it was then three o clock in the morning				429.3817822285338
why should i obtain you by violence if our love is mutual				60372.63657945977
tell him to come to me immediately if he has returned the count is here said the officer and requests to speak with your eminence instantly let him come in then said the cardinal quickly				1437.2088620844772
i escaped the morcerf only to fall into the cavalcanti oh do not confound the two eugénie hold your tongue				1439.4694349268975
my god grant that he may one day suffer what i suffer upon the gospel said d artagnan throwing himself down by the dying man i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to drink of it as you did i do not believe you cried the soldier and he expired amid horrible tortures				19393.700042722463
at the end of a hundred paces the ground began to decline and he could only see the mast of the sloop				9747.478433967444
well if you will have the truth and me too said athos				67.92351947111828
why should you meddle with what does not concern you the two men turned quickly and saw the sickly countenance of la carconte peering between the baluster rails attracted by the sound of voices she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower step head on knees she had listened to the foregoing conversation				566.5164677281045
he also morrel like you considered himself the unhappiest of men well asked morrel				225.5694775199759
in fact the evening before a fever had seized him in the midst of the parliament while he was holding his bed of justice				1449.3391214213973
captivity the fourth day chapter lvi				8859.400273720843
but after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter yes where is this letter cried d artagnan				86.95122158989227
the whole but how my god by a mode of proceeding known to myself and by which i likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinal s police and what did you understand by what we said a thousand things				2432.6761037611705
ah ah cried one of the guards will you persist in saying most discreet aramis that you are not on good terms with madame de bois tracy when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of her handkerchiefs aramis darted at d artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that he has acquired a mortal enemy				1153.8032286977211
rue de la fontaine				126225.92407299364
faithful to his mission of vengeance athos had requested to be conducted to the garden and there upon the sand following the light steps of this woman who left sharp tracks wherever she went he advanced toward the gate which led into the wood and causing it to be opened he went out into the forest				1191.422092490638
d artagnan believed him to be dead or at least insensible and went toward him for the purpose of taking the order but the moment he extended his hand to search for it the wounded man who had not dropped his sword plunged the point into d artagnan s breast crying one for you and one for me the best for last cried d artagnan furious nailing him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body				352.9270866641162
the king they exclaimed as all rose in bewilderment				80131.91712366427
and he took hold of one within his reach his two companions did the same thing				1522.768315090171
had just granted to him with his estate of épinay				3040.0014336368063
thou man of noble heart woe is me				88.23778785780722
he was with you just now				1129.297723001945
well then under these circumstances said caderousse i will i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable begin with his father if you please said the abbé edmond talked to me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love the history is a sad one sir said caderousse shaking his head perhaps you know all the earlier part of it yes answered the abbé edmond related to me everything until the moment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles at la réserve				16547.703490158583
by no means it really seems to me very curious yes indeed				902.2675878247742
milady concealed her face in her hands as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her				214.32419846746663
we are then reconciled dear monsieur porthos said she simpering				726339.1705322424
haydée whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage like all unsophisticated natures delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear				1277.7949282805075
come in come in said morrel for i presume you are all at the door scarcely had he uttered those words when madame morrel entered weeping bitterly				1509.7297434972236
his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majesty s window the cry we heard was his and there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol but the comte de la fere asked the king				455.40764099266823
villefort after having received m de salvieux s letter embraced renée kissed the marquise s hand and shaken that of the marquis started for paris along the aix road				1039.4543459918057
will you take me away with you				64.14362478231266
she is some emissary of the cardinal a woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head the devil				562.3876986405011
what is death for me				71.93541890587721
château renaud rented a stall beside his own while beauchamp as a journalist had unlimited range all over the theatre				89243.78010657658
why is not grimaud the taciturn grimaud here thought d artagnan there are so many things his silence would have told me with grimaud silence was another form of eloquence there reigned a perfect stillness in the house				503.6311708582687
for me said d artagnan are you sure of that pardieu monsieur i can t be more sure				3654.617792769679
you mean to say we have lost said athos quietly drawing four pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table				659.0971556914122
there is not one who has not treated me as the master of the house the only title i desire with respect to you there is not one in fact who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this day				439.737022569063
listen it is impossible				1167.4423063266067
sending their leave of absence will be proof enough that i authorize their journey thanks monsieur				1027.390385423622
you are right a mute from the east				19789.526187888856
about this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of				1220.9140979639171
you are questioning me like a king s attorney				3475.7362014820123
another salver passed loaded like the preceding ones she saw albert attempt to persuade the count but he obstinately refused				3117.011753892035
why should you expose your game to your adversary				2047.4346912559026
has bedeau been killed				1661.7262003251544
your feet too said grimaud				353.9531171231438
those devilish scotchmen are always thirsty				21461.444572026
speak then i am all ears d artagnan related his adventure with mme				187.340050068135
everything is clear to me now				1057.6020657114395
all this i did scrupulously				193013.431827164
what reason do you assign my reason replied the young girl				1079.6880675824887
and now sir resumed mousqueton when he had rid himself of planchet who had in vain tried to clasp his hands behind his friend s fat back now sir allow me to leave you for i could not permit my master to hear of your arrival from any but myself he would never forgive me for not having preceded you this dear friend said d artagnan carefully avoiding to utter either the former name borne by porthos or his new one then he has not forgotten me forgotten he cried mousqueton there s not a day sir that we don t expect to hear that you were made marshal either instead of monsieur de gassion or of monsieur de bassompierre on d artagnan s lips there played one of those rare and melancholy smiles which seemed to emanate from the depth of his soul the last trace of youth and happiness that had survived life s disillusions				60354.10000753961
yes my captain as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking				71961.49965847637
we could scarcely have requested your mother to take a sword and fight us aha				92552.87954429735
i am tired cried d artagnan sitting down				579.7303799131071
take advantage of all and live happily and long				2625.500563856225
that s strange				15183.361007815978
i must visit him he said and obtain some pious grant from him oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to francs a month it is magnificent				5004.282076051648
i am with the person to whom this letter was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that luigi vampa was a man of his word				445.11190807462185
a fine thing indeed grunted porthos				35.761200733415926
go and fetch a physician said she				147.67433680915292
you must do so certainly sir but they tell me that the noise of thunder is the voice of god well then sire continued d artagnan listen to the noise of the people you will perceive that it resembles that of thunder in truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them by the night breeze then all at once it ceased				101333.4339112652
i have given the signal for what for the barricades				9876.751282090567
nevertheless she remained motionless				1234.3307822385038
then you are going with me i will accompany you a portion of the way said athos				46.312991508502556
the people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw out francs in the course of an hour i do not understand you sir said the baroness trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face				644.1107686223552
i am saved murmured he				18.372159685389565
what was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness returned to me				82.41751708751009
we have no time now for suspicions said athos				9.184343214615746
listen madame and recall your remembrances				14129.064480326562
go young men				981.277660070208
this time caderousse endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds				27922.56009394911
well but we should be taken out of prison madame bonacieux was released				16654.887308441197
yes said aramis but that one word is the name of some town or village armentières read porthos armentières				10128.613687620777
i saw then that we were descending a large staircase around us were all my mother s servants carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of gold with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction				85566.40624293181
vampa measured the distance the man was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a chance of overtaking him				36.5901169536414
since the evening before he had really been the hero of one of the tales of the thousand and one nights and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto				3635.04805241971
for you he said				249.68324636372589
yes monsieur the one with which i gather my fruit lend it to us and go into your house again there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you				57.98802095810554
what is this light asked he				9.985962558791453
since that time monsieur nobody entered his chamber but his servant what				607.346567092064
doubtless he was accustomed to such reproaches for he listened to me calm and smiling with his arms crossed over his breast				1324.0491519261066
go to the count of monte cristo avenue des champs élysées on the of may at seven o clock in the evening and demand of him your father				933.1939278249117
the monk				1543.5839034651287
ah said louise breathing freely here we are out of paris yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished fact replied eugénie				1833.857307025736
then porthos and aramis will you remain with this man while we go around to grimaud grimaud had made himself a kind of sentry box out of a hollow willow and as they drew near he put his head out and gave a low whistle				21992.671964950776
are the carbines loaded yes brigadier well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly fire upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside staircase accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting andrea had excited in the crowd				3579.8387762844445
yes said he yes anne of austria is my true queen				378.64777036606114
i ask you what year is it the year returned jacopo				3428.5495469849025
he left the room and returned in five minutes with a phial				10806.620949176133
her mistress put on a charming face and smiled on her graciously but alas				1427.429267181887
speak madame said the cardinal affecting an effusive frankness of speech i shall convince your majesty i trust of my devotion to you and my desire to terminate an affair which you have so much at heart				369.19095766116527
how much you have need of me cunning rogue thought gondy				5305.08346394835
by a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself the young catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt				14314.508099786235
it was not over the downfall of the man but over the defeat of the napoleonic idea that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence				2162.33022420215
what do you want with us he asked of groslow				2415.2104891189138
the young man appeared on the threshold of the minister s closet in one hand holding his hat in the other the letter				622.9551141205008
i do assure you grandpapa ah m				507.76687279223904
and you did cry he asked				1086.1753562537117

let me look for this letter it must be with my title deeds d artagnan opened an old casket which stood in a corner of the room and which was full of parchments referring to an estate during a period of two hundred years lost to his family				1589.0923353238811

bonacieux in a voice almost caressing and pressing the hand of d artagnan who had not relinquished hers well i will not say as much as you do what is lost for today may not be lost forever				4533.616678954973
jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was				1863.1165552595883
desrues was however i must confess more skilful what would you have sir said the lady laughing we do what we can				4587.022521407762

so much the better				832.8213749597867
diable he said after having swallowed the divine preserve				24295.659173001422
bravo d artagnan				28.306925959413565
he shut the bedroom door after him without adding another word and returned to his apartments and when madame danglars recovered from her half fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream				1418.716404151194
i gratify my wishes by two means my will and my money				994.3621901774145
special rules set forth in the general terms of use part of this license apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the project gutenberg™ concept and trademark				10362.855692033585
but excuse me sir for talking of our domestic misfortunes i interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist no madame i did not say as much as that replied the count with a smile quite the contrary				8995.303216126087
i do not understand you i mean mercédès that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him fernand cried mercédès i believed you were good hearted and i was mistaken				1803.774684408043
every one nowadays wants auxiliaries propositions have been made to me and i confess to you frankly that the coadjutor has made me speak out monsieur de gondy				5226.797072800128
gentlemen cried the surrounding group				23300.510403510874
but although her voice sweet full and sonorous vibrated as harmoniously and as affectingly as ever the door remained shut				11974.690942700574
are you going pray say everything that is kind to countess g on the part of her friend the vampire and what message shall i convey to the baroness that with her permission i shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening the third act had begun and during its progress the count of morcerf according to his promise made his appearance in the box of madame danglars				589.7218998800973
because it is a grievous thing for me to meet again those two men who caused the failure of our enterprise and yet said porthos neither of them had any advantage over us				350.4164401879293
some unknown enemy an invisible foe has done this the more must you fortify yourself albert				314.036535603363
danglars however who now made his appearance accompanied by caderousse effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with m morrel who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve				11955.361156667088
but the count of monte cristo surrounds me with every paternal care and i am ignorant of nothing which passes in the world				691.3444049924725
you call yourself in paris the count of monte cristo in italy sinbad the sailor in malta i forget what				624.6094887805054
a paltry piece of business murmured d artagnan crumpling his note				8337.396521993845
tell them she was my beloved my noble girl my only blessing in the world				693.8196173989917
as the gascon had foreseen they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the ring				2939.560383776021
the entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of gold				1904.1630873830763
he shook his head perceived the cabaret at which he had left aramis and putting his horse to the trot he shortly pulled up at the door				191.38639508785315
tell me tell me tell me i say repeated milady how do you know it how do i know it said d artagnan				56.41229815878875
does he regret me a little				1042.0617583042667
that letter you have received and which you believe to be from madame de chevreuse well it is a forgery how can that be yes a forgery it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance when they come to fetch you but it is d artagnan that will come do not deceive yourself				909.2301281833307
yes i am a man of honor said d artagnan determined to come to an end and since your love is mine and i am satisfied i possess it for i do possess it do i not entirely go on well i feel as if transformed a confession weighs on my mind a confession if i had the least doubt of your love i would not make it but you love me my beautiful mistress do you not without doubt then if through excess of love i have rendered myself culpable toward you you will pardon me perhaps d artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to milady s but she evaded him				31.566342918562903
has your uneasiness anything to do with what m de blacas has told me and m de villefort has just confirmed m de blacas moved suddenly towards the baron but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as matters were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect				18182.140755660337
then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf could follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge s door and which merits a particular description				6099.83358968135
wait a week and i myself will give you some a week is too long				2827.788867123746
at this moment a monstrous battering was heard				719.3487238442813
yes and as i am just now excessively annoyed i shall go from home				1424.4239565075484
the procurator s wife took porthos into an adjoining room and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation				125568.68960214409
since i have the good fortune to meet you i beg you to receive them and to hold me always as one of your friends monsieur the duke said m de tréville i was so confident of your loyalty that i required no other defender before his majesty than yourself				907.7654606829886
here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant smile				462.26395309991955
bonacieux and the duke entered the louvre without difficulty				6712.294021600848
he then rolled them separately and put them in a hat which he handed to mordaunt				1900.7086530820065
the king went away enchanted				76109.85330988132
what is the meaning of that noise oh my god cried morrel turning pale what is it a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and half stifled sobs				4473.76597191603
dantès was occupied in arranging this piece of wood when he heard faria who had remained in edmond s cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope ladder call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering				5401.375859808568
after breakfast it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at athos s lodging and there finish their plans				7151.342019498873

a bottle perhaps a whole bottle				6881.813573211106
the brother did not perceive this he had turned round to play with milady s favorite monkey which had pulled him by the doublet				5853.333110943815
he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the officer was touched and although firm in his duty he kindly said my worthy friend let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions				18924.726755005242
if anyone wishes to stop us i will show monsieur de tréville s letter and you will show your leaves of absence				4124.552274224101
d artagnan stretched out his arm in which he held the lantern put his head in at the half opened door and seeing that the cabin was nothing better than a shed good he said				467.6447342633849
if i had them i should think myself as rich as croesus then aloud are you ambitious as enceladus well my friend i bring you the means of becoming rich powerful and free to do whatever you wish the shadow of a cloud passed over aramis s face as quickly as that which in august passes over the field of grain but quick as it was it did not escape d artagnan s observation				5827.8947624767
my only fear is the chance of dantès being released				18036.91313652219
sir he thus addressed d artagnan your resistance is useless these prisoners have just been given me by my illustrious patron oliver cromwell these words struck d artagnan like a thunderbolt				13102.650794935687
but when i have found them then tremble sir				534.7652826638863

in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and one of the flag stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by dantès before he had power to offer any resistance				4522.648040944609
allow me to ask you a question where are the plenipotentiaries at charenton in the second house on the right on entering from the direction of paris and was this conference arranged beforehand no gentlemen it seems to be the result of certain propositions which mazarin made last night to the parisians athos and aramis exchanged smiles for they well knew what those propositions were to whom they had been made and who had made them				104.58893535627564
said monte cristo you do not appear to be in the possession of your senses provided i understand your perfidy sir and succeed in making you understand that i will be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said albert furiously				47072.09556968945

she had not long to wait directly afterwards the door was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut				13747.498191638168
through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line with that in the dressing room the count could see into the street				1160.9971100363414
on a table in the next room were lighted candles cards two dice boxes and dice				2321.7672568975736
but what have you done asked franz				468.3887754831487
the recompense will exceed your expectations that is all i promise you more intrigues				5373.830999852961
yes i know it because yesterday monsieur de wardes in a saloon where i was showed a ring which he said he had received from you wretch cried milady				487.7975183104347
and i too murmured the young lady with the velvet eyes				609.5867317026425
nothing good replied d artagnan shaking his head				358.1488003743306
to say that i shall live here like the mercédès of other times gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe me				89.95671527763378
edmond s hair stood on end and he rose to his knees				1537.5682396410812
but since you possess that virtue why the devil don t you make use of it with respect to her majesty				2093.624852150413
albert rose to return to his place				593.3832118227609
since my brother s assassination in the streets of nîmes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the road from bellegarde to beaucaire at the sign of the pont du gard				5782.260484723879
athos was standing before the door enveloped in his cloak with his hat pulled down over his eyes				603.2831560373188
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room				191.71905330537373
d avrigny who attends my mother declares he is in despair about it				78.28450221763286
i have seen russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison certainly it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed yes i understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather how did you habituate yourself to it oh very easily				9480.261346695892
well asked the duke				673.6139454151918
danglars was balancing his monthly accounts and it was perhaps not the most favorable moment for finding him in his best humor				2458.710047255107
for some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions				56104.0469086645
i suppose that you think it necessary that i should disturb the repose of these illustrious lords to say gentlemen your servant mousqueton is thirsty what does monsieur bracieux care think you whether i am thirsty or not tis a very expensive wine said blaisois shaking his head				378.66167322745366
d artagnan not less forward than they did likewise and all ran out in order to repair to their posts				8132.975587770652
all was vain and he lost two hours in his attempts which were at last utterly useless				2330.0043020089597
he redoubled his gayety and carelessness				73340.86456306271
he extended his hands and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock				2219.782356672972
oh it was a touching superstition monsieur and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the world have destroyed my father s faith				1532.2962773850727
the breakfast chapter				230.46999882439215
but said the abbé i would speak to you of a large sum amounting to five millions the very sum you named whispered the inspector in his turn				1148.254880184618
the other sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato and he your excellency is poor peppino the fact is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme fear that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example but peppino did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes				118004.52391395868
athos smiled the smile was melancholy				6291.080784102341
in france my dear sir half such a piece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five years for change of air will you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest majesty				2109.041458532697
then with a friendly gesture toward mousqueton that he might forgive him for finishing an enterprise so brilliantly begun by another he glided like a serpent through the opening and disappeared				602.2926667093095
two lackeys dragged milady whom each held by one arm				1309.997033078667
put him to death franz sprang back but the count seized his arm and held him before the window				440.6898042002174
d artagnan had heard the conversation and had understood it				62.79409917466447
speak my friend i listen there is not a hope replied faria shaking his head but no matter god wills it that man whom he has created and in whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life should do all in his power to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear oh yes yes exclaimed dantès and i tell you that i will save you yet well then try				72644.82543320565
yes count and charged with a commission for which i beg of you to accept my excuses what is it be so good as to give me up your sword count athos smiled and opened the window				450.78199829533395
he was a brave and an honest man and a first rate seaman one who had seen long and honorable service as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of morrel son replied danglars				559.7468386627675
now for the wager				34524.04760422238
fortunately as regarded this circumstance at least his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory				43276.76522323137
one of these ladies the fair one uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house while the other rushing to the bell rope rang with all her strength				1949.5077129035035
perhaps you will think sir that prosperity has spoiled me art thou happy friend asked d artagnan				35.112435820672815
how strange continued the king with some asperity the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty persons sire your majesty will i trust be amply satisfied on this point at least we shall see				1027.6049831180546
raoul his hat in ribbons his face bleeding felt not only his strength but also his reason going a red mist covered his sight and through this mist he saw a hundred threatening arms stretched over him ready to seize upon him when he fell				2675.5584770361993
i neither know nor care				1847.0219786208622
at last when pistache was sufficiently well trained monsieur de beaufort invited the governor and officers of vincennes to attend a representation which he was going to have in his apartment				631.7151903595452
zounds lieutenant said he you are not unlucky in being charged with such commissions particularly if my lord has authorized you to look into her bed felton blushed				4912.547662271553
on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady and bound her hands and feet				814.9617767627075
if that be the case said d artagnan they are doubtless transporting her from one prison to another				1201.9259730687932
the skiff lightning d artagnan had judged correctly mordaunt felt that he had no time to lose and he lost none				3968.934602058895
yes she of whom you told me one day at amiens athos uttered a groan and let his head sink on his hands				499.6775706786857
go away he said your repentance is too recent to inspire confidence				5524.879920465453
from time to time noises came in the direction of the public markets				70723.38512872576
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the horses were unharnessed and others put in their places without anyone claiming money from the traveller				10643.534942404076
d artagnan seeing him approach drew his sword a foot out of the scabbard				12176.49584144241
in your place in truth sire i should yield to such powerful instance and on my part it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs what say you duke i say sire that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles and these never ending labors				75572.31613369919
suddenly vampa turned toward his mistress ah said he good good				1610.0650570454586
he approached the other door and taking off his hat respectfully said madame will you permit me to offer you my services				119431.39658842773
i m not the man you take me for you are in captain rogers s post are you not				558.366759593955
we are looking for the house of monsieur de la fere said d artagnan				44.104685283169225
i wish to say three words to you monsieur chevalier stammered the soubrette				9706.088166028423
the dishes were of silver and the plates of japanese china				81481.57268429612
he judged that the match would be so much the less equal if athos and his companions were really plotting and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at command all his anger faded away into a smile				533.9570468795874
unluckily i hit him on the head and immediately his face was covered with blood and he said nothing as he died yes he exclaimed oh i suppose answered d artagnan laughing if he only said that it did not enlighten you much well sir cried the queen				354.44426398664905

noirtier rue coq héron no				745.5551185391819
it is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself who set these bungling assassins to work in order to have if wanted the right of using reprisals but we must not believe everything ministers say nor everything their enemies say				1483.4191666141248
you ask what god is doing				2645.259992531879
to lose a year two years three years is to talk of an eternity to return after the death or disgrace of the cardinal perhaps to return when d artagnan and his friends happy and triumphant should have received from the queen the reward they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her these were devouring ideas that a woman like milady could not endure				5049.479671262765
as quick as thought he tore open the letter in spite of the cry which kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do or rather what he was doing				2571.968931482971
come along athos come along cried d artagnan now we have found everything except money it would be stupid to be killed but athos continued to march majestically whatever remarks his companions made and they finding their remarks useless regulated their pace by his				1379.9810136561523
franz hastened to inquire after the count and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient time but pastrini reassured him by saying that the count of monte cristo had ordered a second carriage for himself and that it had gone at four o clock to fetch him from the rospoli palace				2169.2505375577666
she was struck no doubt with a superstitious idea she conceived that heaven denied its aid and she remained in the attitude in which she had fallen her head drooping and her hands clasped				63397.54420023847
yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied but to emmanuel				917.0432120433479
monsieur de chevreuse had not been appointed governor of a province and if the queen should consent to be godmother it could be only of her grandson or granddaughter				16180.725097315175

the trap once replaced over his head you being on the trap dead or alive they will need at least ten minutes to find the hole by which he has escaped				10367.847702632698
never more to be separated why as to that i think my dear son you must be by this time so accustomed to france as to look upon it almost as a second country the fact is said the young man that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it as for me you must know i can not possibly live out of lucca therefore i shall return to italy as soon as i can but before you leave france my dear father i hope you will put me in possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my descent certainly i am come expressly on that account it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your hands and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining years of my life where are these papers then here they are andrea seized the certificate of his father s marriage and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the circumstances he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the contents				37135.91430311929
felton lowered his head and reflected				2350.1752485826187
and turning with that fury which made him so formidable he rushed toward the chief of the insurgents a man who with a huge sword in his hand was trying to hew a passage to the coach door through the musketeers				702.8948114366871
it was indeed for him that they were there				782.5953562889657
the fowl was tender the wine old the fire clear and sparkling and andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though nothing had happened				1485.0887426437969
now it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess two years exclaimed dantès do you really believe i can acquire all these things in so short a time not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned				13957.319514274932
never never added porthos				83.19263236396674
he lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler then when he was within ten paces of him he commenced a conversation which almost always ended by the traveler s abandoning his purse to save his life				567.5152298606963
yes hell has resuscitated you continued athos				83.71101319650589
ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor enter the apartment take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your father				941.6604997078786
i am about perhaps to discover something here i am in the vein she tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor				16158.719834561003
this could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement				5613.891444502429

i had been tracked by a customs officer who had lost sight of me near the tavern feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in time to hear the report of the pistol and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my innocence utterly futile				17587.946719898366
as the steward had said the notary awaited him in the small salon				3567.6340932335493
all those fighting citizens went out to battle and they have been massacred it was then with a sentiment of uneasiness whether planchet who alone could give them information was alive or dead that the friends returned to the place royale to their great surprise they found the citizens still encamped there drinking and bantering each other although doubtless mourned by their families who thought they were at charenton in the thickest of the fighting				3414.687875150708

m and madame de villefort bowed and left the room giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her grandfather s presence and feeling sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid				2676.258986052822

he preferred to use the sitting room upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for months at a time according to his valet de chambre				82457.54183892142
the next morn broke off the coast of aleria all day they coasted and in the evening saw fires lighted on land the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing for a ship s lantern was hung up at the mast head instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore				6200.183311474061
the man hearing nothing more stood erect and while monte cristo was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale				58119.07347817405
the notary solemnly took the pen flourished it above his head and said gentlemen we are about to sign the contract the baron was to sign first then the representative of m cavalcanti senior then the baroness afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents				47751.53622483242
twice he was obliged to step back his opponent stirred not one inch				86118.83544817405

only three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill and i was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door so that i am here something in the fashion of a conqueror holding my position as it were my conquest				44125.02042301741
i will take him dead that s all a terrible cry was heard and the wife and daughters of broussel held up their hands in supplication to the people the latter knew that this officer who was so pale but who appeared so determined would keep his word they continued to threaten but they began to disperse				66313.32581627613

i come for your commands my lord he said				318.66369989661405
and i suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man without the smallest regard for his feelings had made a strong impression on his mind for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner the name of m noirtier interposed maximilian is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know valentine that he took a leading part in every bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the bourbons oh i have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange the father a bonapartist the son a royalist what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics				3212.2137311887295
de morcerf continued beauchamp looked at this woman with surprise and terror				1179.358319904621
the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance closed the door of the study and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of valentine				828.5182169237846
as i passed the city gates i declared that i had found the child on the road and i inquired where the asylum was the box confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the blood with which i was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from anyone else				2274.8937896092334
let us see for you know my dear captain a judge must hear both sides good lord				266.80251776987876
bonacieux who waited for him and who with the same precautions and the same good luck conducted him out of the louvre				3147.0541599243725
d artagnan watched over the youth as if he had been his own son				903.2822211111774
have you never experienced for anyone that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar friend though in reality it was the first time you had ever met				13548.335974426844
chapter ii				4343.1417201356935
let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished his cloak				918.2745446774436
albert as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow				1887.1730273909768
but you know him m de morcerf is it that excellent m bertuccio who understands hiring windows so well yes you saw him the day i had the honor of receiving you he has been a soldier a smuggler in fact everything				840.2118162202574

her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess her eyes which cast the brilliancy of emeralds were perfectly beautiful and yet were at the same time full of sweetness and majesty				1994.8693443029072
the next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began				1551.4759382976913
you are come too late you are come to see me die				1437.36923464544
the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn				1193.3068807416075
that will do replied the cardinal				317.68815324804683
i set out three days ago passing miraculously through the puritan army and i took post horses with my servant tony the horses upon which we were mounted were bought in paris				491.73425685660936
two inches an hour does not seem much but in twelve hours that makes two feet and three we had before that makes five				1947.8193653592584
one word more sir do you promise me to make what use you can of the report of the fortune m cavalcanti will bring without touching the money				1012.5744928670244
let us not misunderstand each other replied monte cristo i introduce no one and certainly not m cavalcanti and who said albert with a forced smile is to marry mademoiselle danglars instead of me which grieves me cruelly what				548.1780230876564
to danglars monte cristo also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the baroness to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses				977.8137702550163
and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude				1691.4573856587722
gracious heavens exclaimed dantès what is the matter				1369.9433162200453
that proof satisfied him so completely that as a sign of satisfaction he has sent me as your majesty may see to consider with you what reparation should be made to gentlemen unjustly treated and wrongfully persecuted i listen to you and i wonder at you sir said the queen				376.05850152860796
but tell me what do you ask nothing for that amounts to the same thing as if i asked you for something the procurator s wife hung upon the arm of porthos and in the violence of her grief she cried out monsieur porthos i am ignorant of all such matters				5233.031615795762
however that might have been the priest dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure him				38.85879834194509
but you continued m bonacieux in a tone of perfect good fellowship what has become of you all these days				503.7928177819386
d avrigny recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier				1831.093502300942
but since our resolution is formed let us act promptly				38305.199068320035
he did not look like an executioner and who else save an executioner would have wished to fill that horrible office but said mordaunt it might have been some personal enemy of the king who had made a vow of vengeance and accomplished it in this way				929.2406544848066
her forehead almost touched the carpet when the count sprang forward and raised her				195.27174020289527
many also who were not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy appearance the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said nothing and made no arithmetical calculations				93845.55425730757
if he proves himself worthy of it i will do what i can to advance his interests				15758.202622614632
or from your generosity my friend to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another what is that break his arm wound him but do not kill him i will tell you morrel said the count that i do not need entreating to spare the life of m de morcerf he shall be so well spared that he will return quietly with his two friends while i and you that will be another thing i shall be brought home no no cried maximilian quite unable to restrain his feelings				46979.17232727629
château renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his coupé joined him beauchamp did the same				1123.4048273027463
it may be judged whether d artagnan looked or listened with avidity				145460.80296911098
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut gold a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridge box worked with gold and red and green silk sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with diamond buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt				13179.423259553585
the blow was sped by d artagnan the rapier had pierced his bosom				2919.290644608665
one day you will be able to understand how all this is well then to the king your nephew				10108.214288887599
officer meanwhile the cardinal looked anxiously for news from england but no news arrived that was not annoying and threatening				29247.497948437078
here are five francs for his trouble indeed said louise i admire you and i could almost say respect you the laundress looked on in astonishment but as she had been promised twenty louis she made no remark				7158.151670694769
if we are so fortunate as to have some particular duty to perform for your eminence we are ready to obey you				65.01194597840188
the king s authority will put all this to rights was it to tell me that madame coldly replied gondy that your majesty admitted me to the honor of entering your presence no my dear coadjutor said mazarin it was to ask your advice in the unhappy dilemma in which we find ourselves is it true asked gondy feigning astonishment that her majesty summoned me to ask for my opinion yes said the queen it is requested the coadjutor bowed				1337.4839195514508
at this instant m de tréville entered cool polite and in irreproachable costume				3393.2624734828505
italy sinbad the sailor towards the beginning of the year two young men belonging to the first society of paris the viscount albert de morcerf and the baron franz d épinay were at florence				23817.968931141608
bonacieux without any suspicion accompanied her				170.38873520744517
were they then so necessary they were indispensable the major passed his hand across his brow				451.6122524760325
the noise increased steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the steps leading to the cavern				3008.4292968361387
madame de villefort is ill but mademoiselle de villefort stammered the nurse				8362.424511481897
you will accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the honor and profit from it i will do it captain but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshal s presence as easily as you expect here is a ring that will obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the captain				1153.7916750542613
i willingly submit to any punishment your eminence may please to inflict upon me				86.91631795240485
he is master of his arm yet he strikes without remorse the executioner muttered athos as if arrested by some recollection				21915.56078989856
monsieur de beaufort or monsieur le prince but monsieur le prince is to set out for the army he is entirely devoted to the cardinal oh oh said aramis there are questions between them at this very moment				535.8179206480876
he visited his own dungeon				4207.646951853873
the general remembered that i had formerly been a naval officer and he gave me the command of this expedition				30663.13105160285
d artagnan you are a great man and when you occupy monsieur de tréville s place i will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey well i am in a maze said porthos do you approve of what d artagnan has done parbleu indeed i do said athos i not only approve of what he has done but i congratulate him upon it and now gentlemen said d artagnan without stopping to explain his conduct to porthos all for one one for all that is our motto is it not and yet said porthos				173.45035471277143
you are ill shall i ring for assistance shall i call no said villefort rising hastily stay where you are				843.5067477109344
a sigh escaped him				31.71251164931773
it must be a very irksome office to be the father of a grown up daughter it seems to make one feverish and to raise one s pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done but m d épinay unlike you bears his misfortune patiently still more he talks seriously about the matter puts on a white tie and speaks of his family				1606.831521420213
in fact he could say these two children of a cruel and persecuting king who have inherited the vices of their father which i alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the english people whose unhappiness they the children would infallibly have caused thus was lady macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her son and not her husband whatever shakespeare may say a throne				4127.590038571994
porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this sword				1379.6744075014797
ah said aramis				28.79691075673222
the cardinal made a sign to his attendant who drew near				4383.567676547051
an instant after the broken door was removed and the pale face of athos appeared who with a rapid glance took a survey of the surroundings				12367.10366029793
i became very pale i felt my legs fail me i sought for a reply but could find none i was silent				1277.9789501611237
the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros islands had doubled pomègue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board				8245.081595842124
what dost thou there rascal asked comminges				7740.7227106471
the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance				5527.309434020193
they needed breakfast and alighted at the door of an auberge recommended by a sign representing st martin giving half his cloak to a poor man				148.05408811500783
an unhappy prisoner replied dantès who made no hesitation in answering				20307.97373535931
the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of dantès over the crew and himself				192.4167479207112
i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay your family appears to be a very happy one said the count as if speaking to himself				193.59023459957686

not if it were my own brother cried d artagnan as if carried away by his enthusiasm				3138.45829349304
but said he as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches of kitty i must not play the fool				13701.609061821158
i say sir you sir who are hiding yourself behind that shutter yes you sir tell me what you are laughing at and we will laugh together the gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier as if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that such strange reproaches were addressed then when he could not possibly entertain any doubt of the matter his eyebrows slightly bent and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described he replied to d artagnan i was not speaking to you sir but i am speaking to you replied the young man additionally exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners of politeness and scorn				156860.3069753882
his body seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable manner his senses seemed to redouble their power the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze then in the midst of the songs of his sailors songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been taken down he saw the island of monte cristo no longer as a threatening rock in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert then as his boat drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city				1009.0405415049277

another recollection contributed also to sadden raoul on their arrival at sonores he had perceived hidden behind a screen of poplars a little chateau which so vividly recalled that of la valliere to his mind that he halted for nearly ten minutes to gaze at it and resumed his journey with a sigh too abstracted even to reply to olivain s respectful inquiry about the cause of so much fixed attention				1161.0823685773403
and your two other friends he asked				1177.1564816926268

yes he said				191.73066384053348
there i will indicate to you the best place and time the two young men bowed and separated aramis ascending the street which led to the luxembourg while d artagnan perceiving the appointed hour was approaching took the road to the carmes deschaux saying to himself decidedly i can t draw back but at least if i am killed i shall be killed by a musketeer chapter v the king s musketeers and the cardinal s guards d artagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris				495.4215666842043
tell me truly maximilian whether in former days when our fathers dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them not that i am aware of replied the young man unless indeed any ill feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties your father was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any other difference between them				104.60933494874284

i come to entreat you sir continued madame de villefort as the only one who has the right of doing so inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your love for that she has always possessed but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter there was a doubtful expression in noirtier s eyes he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so				455.87085147493457
listen my dear my adored valentine said he in his melodious and grave tone those who like us have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world such may read each other s hearts				8631.151799275553

notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance				3181.8679018527077

morrel reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what dantès had told him of his interview with the grand marshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed him				25.287469833500662
all looked around athos himself stared				73869.85588760987
a black point floated on the sea				625.904335219073
morrel now emerged from his hiding place where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion				4161.748774100229
i informed them at the hotel that i had the honor of passing the night here duke said franz and desired them to come and inform me of his return ah replied the duke here i think is one of my servants who is seeking you the duke was not mistaken when he saw franz the servant came up to him				30.719816124923685
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o clock				996.2900492139617
it seems his former master accustomed him to that well dear monsieur la ramee replied the cardinal let him prove a true and thankful keeper and we will shut our eyes upon his rural misdeeds and put on his back a uniform to make him respectable and in the pockets of that uniform some pistoles to drink to the king s health mazarin was large in promises quite unlike the virtuous monsieur grimaud so bepraised by la ramee for he said nothing and did much				1791.621218907639
that s unworthy				212229.75745602627
la ramee carried off all his clothes in order to be certain that the duke would not stir				17428.190974550955
the host will tell you i have three or four more so that you will not inconvenience me in any way				869.8746933863404

i want air that is all will you come into the garden said debray advancing towards the back staircase				3138.509176045654
aramis blushed excessively and snatched rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon				1160.4641093013113
really said d artagnan these people are very ingenious				93044.2281612034
immediately without any other signal the carriages moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the streets like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its course between its two granite banks				57010.38764113342
what then would be the use of all i have suffered				111109.6445367917
the deliverance of the cardinal perhaps				4625.7994432779005
the door was instantly opened and shut someone was taken in the mousetrap				11613.077619950576
i shall take a cutlet on my way to the chamber do not do anything of the sort for were the gentleman a montmorency and the diplomatist a metternich we will breakfast at eleven in the meantime follow debray s example and take a glass of sherry and a biscuit be it so i will stay i must do something to distract my thoughts you are like debray and yet it seems to me that when the minister is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous ah you do not know with what i am threatened				142625.29972608085
then he has neither the parliament nor the people with him they represent the wealth of the country nor the nobles nor the princes who are the military power of france d artagnan scratched his ear				1240.981283621197
their masters are dead				592.0424275507842
will your eminence please read and examine i am acquainted with it sign it then reflect gentlemen that a signature given under circumstances like the present might be regarded as extorted by violence monseigneur will be at hand to testify that it was freely given suppose i refuse then said d artagnan your eminence must expect the consequences of a refusal would you dare to touch a cardinal you have dared my lord to imprison her majesty s musketeers the queen will revenge me gentlemen i do not think so although inclination might lead her to do so but we shall take your eminence to paris and the parisians will defend us how uneasy they must be at this moment at rueil and saint germain said aramis				184.97180344626784

but when the cardinal added that not only mme				191.0773642216533
the repast was carried into effect that very day and the lackey waited at table				669.6178600049188
what do you mean cried d artagnan				10.211431068748155
for instance there is apoplexy that lightning stroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings everything to an end				746.4415720044867
and you are a fool for having said anything about it said a voice from the top of the stairs				1137.891186104457
la jeune amélie had a very active crew very obedient to their captain who lost as little time as possible				900.9438671139158
i confess observed monte cristo that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and beautiful oh said morcerf this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my side whence can it arise then				1183.8895164536825
planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of d artagnan and which d artagnan from that time made shift to do without				34349.39731896873
but what changes occur				88463.60708995348
milady was only a queen while among queens				73542.71841994642
and why so asked porthos warmly				22200.788203658885
he saw a corpse at his feet				832.4513411840037
they are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and liberty what do you fear vasiliki said selim in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud				10610.96129136999
and mazarin buried himself so far behind the two friends that he disappeared completely hidden between them				109.9949752004801
they are those of monsieur le coadjuteur he said				379.30844904752126

in the name of heaven madame said villefort where is the doctor				1824.6576220179586
however much the ballet might have claimed his attention franz was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any note of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her companion who during the whole time the piece lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra				79928.5932966807
you are quite upset				26398.27946671796
it was as a prey to this hallucination that d artagnan traveled at whatever pace his horse pleased the six or eight leagues that separated chantilly from crèvecœur without his being able to remember on his arrival in the village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road				1054.5046366712736
some ham my boy or we can t drink and her brother added d artagnan timidly				2750.632547932393
and maximilian morrel left the room with the baron de château renaud leaving monte cristo alone with morcerf				738.4903677763065
on entering the room noirtier s eyes met those of the abbé and no doubt he read some particular expression in them for he remained in the room				171.9619211532833
a deathlike silence reigned in the room above				2396.5214454159036
i will die here and you will see if a phantom that accuses is not more terrible than a living being that threatens you shall have no weapon left in your power there is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every creature who has the courage to use it				83.19283071089518
i have seen milady where demanded d artagnan				14.632114224956442
by the side of andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence and who had been appointed by the court for andrea disdained to pay any attention to those details to which he appeared to attach no importance				4696.432103486114
he thought how one day in a less dangerous situation than the one in which he was now placed he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his honor				1472.7203707592828
nevertheless d artagnan was struck by the appearance of this new personage				36454.404186100415
and this all knew so well that it was a double victory for the court a victory at home and abroad so that even when the young king learned the news he exclaimed ah gentlemen of the parliament we shall see what you will say now upon which the queen had pressed the royal child to her heart whose haughty and unruly sentiments were in such harmony with her own				969.637345124643
that which i have to say is too long and above all too secret well what is to be done if monsieur chevalier would follow me said kitty timidly				2553.3291399720747

i was a witness of the last hours of charles i				1260.494443414297
as to getting him drunk the duke couldn t hope to do that and he laughed at the mere thought of it				63.914029472067895
aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious it was better not to fathom them				98.01062148083591
the prince procured for marie michon the dress of a cavalier and for kitty that of a lackey he sent them two excellent horses and the fugitives went out hastily from tours shaping their course toward spain trembling at the least noise following unfrequented roads and asking for hospitality when they found themselves where there was no inn why really it was all exactly as you say cried madame de chevreuse clapping her hands				557.3777190082253
porthos was in bed and was playing a game at lansquenet with mousqueton to keep his hand in while a spit loaded with partridges was turning before the fire and on each side of a large chimneypiece over two chafing dishes were boiling two stewpans from which exhaled a double odor of rabbit and fish stews rejoicing to the smell				42173.10776605318
that s because i don t care to leave you the means of corrupting your jailers				19810.01373337008
i may sleep perhaps at an inn pierre obeyed				1585.608290982718
monte cristo remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him				30.058924894855075
i know it and the duke put the quill to the paper				1104.6008663036039
when the lady of the red cushion came close to porthos porthos drew his dripping hand from the font				17095.67997573461
i have sent for three of my friends but who knows whether they were at home yes yes				1385.43363452087

m de villefort was as usual unmoved				8237.756421500533
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked something more in the manner of the venus of milo or capua but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of actæon and indeed it required but one glance at mademoiselle danglars to comprehend the justness of morcerf s remark				6125.051015882738
so much the better but that it may prove laughter worthy even to the end let us not lose time and he jumped off the wall				1101.4088555056283
it was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting				95325.5885025096
this man who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the mob not a muscle of whose face was stirred either at mazarin s witticisms or by the jests of the multitude seemed to the cardinal a peculiar being who having participated in past events similar to those now occurring was calculated to cope with those now on the eve of taking place				592.6954831643375
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www gutenberg org donate				3355.7229422673013

anne reclining in a large easy chair her head supported by her hand her elbow resting on a table was looking at her son who was turning over the leaves of a large book filled with pictures				4708.5540973252055

oh very simply black trousers patent leather boots white waistcoat either a black or blue coat and a long cravat				67738.06420966095
his father yes his father replied the abbé his right name was noirtier de villefort at this instant a bright light shot through the mind of dantès and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before				861.855036772536
my first visit was to the thicket				29959.448253665792
the will was never wanting to get away you would not mind you added knocking down a door or a wall tis true i said so and i say it again and i answered you porthos that it was not a good plan that we couldn t go a hundred steps without being recaptured because we were without clothes to disguise ourselves and arms to defend ourselves that is true we should need clothes and arms well said d artagnan rising we have them friend porthos and even something better bah said porthos looking around				1975.3728032361257

noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full of grief that she arrested the departure of the notary				1575.5159203562869
you have found out that there is something worth having about this large gentleman there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it you know his business here then pardieu he has come to draw but i don t know how much you will know presently my friend very well only do not give me false information as you did the other day what do you mean of whom do you speak				993.6275309997408
then when the officer was gone he sat down in the arm chair opposite the president and struck his boots with a little cane which he carried in his hand				195.4188207117332

m morrel unhappy exclaimed the abbé				469.6152032499733
felton arose				2291.250741350708
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen				2301.5185535856335
by whom by the gentleman who was here yesterday				1366.3662800847937
these steps drew near to his dungeon the door was thrown open and the guards appeared				1154.0260715969755
is he afraid of me or of his father				912.6877815031664
ah valentine tell me if he ever looked on you with one of those sweet smiles				5128.439817138158
the night was dark snow was falling the streets were silent and deserted				4828.5234210980825
in the examination which precedes ordination a thesis is always a requisite ordination cried d artagnan who could not believe what the hostess and bazin had successively told him and he gazed half stupefied upon the three persons before him				28.544248152920694
the poor girl was so sad that she did not even notice milady s condescension				20355.67296030371
while d artagnan was examining mme				186.23757147449598
except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a chance count although the general opinion at rome is that the count is a man of very high distinction his manners are admirable said the countess at least as far as i could judge in the few minutes he remained here they are perfect mother so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europe the english the spanish and the german the countess paused a moment then after a slight hesitation she resumed				78138.95027603244
no one knew how the three former tenants of that house left it				91.59851380313859
belay this order was also executed and the vessel passed as dantès had predicted twenty fathoms to windward				85161.96395332596
while thinking and walking athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove broken in halves the other extremity passing into the chamber above and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words which at length fixed his attention				1132.2363162888075
it was an order the count had just given for immediately ali went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat				2079.508519512965
then i feel as if i could adore madame de villefort do not be in such a hurry to do that said valentine with a sad smile				506.601184305437
ali knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so and as he comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one and now the mystery is solved certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation but it is not the less true that you ah but what do i hear and morcerf inclined his head towards the door through which sounds seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar				141162.76660201116
tis then the devil that pursues he cried drawing his sword and preparing to attack the new foe				31881.996388920405
i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young man has brought against me and from this hour hold myself under the authority of the procureur who will succeed me and as he spoke these words with a hoarse choking voice he staggered towards the door which was mechanically opened by a door keeper				18843.810456111336
this is all very fine dear aramis murmured d artagnan				12.177052081845344
d artagnan dressed himself and athos did the same				1160.0452971213672
he sat down occasionally on his bed pressing his hand on his heart				383.4346334435896
but to avoid risk put the pistols in the holsters				5831.5585786897955
rochefort he exclaimed you				51.8264570167607
the smugglers dantès had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast				87037.13926959409
the day after the event she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain oh it is terrible and m de boville retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the father				916.1214514962879
you see said porthos this is my usual style devil take me answered d artagnan i wish you joy of it				71.89053227772939
why this woman was a monster				26779.211214901214

during these hours of profound meditation which to him had seemed only minutes he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath				8669.752146432233
milady breathed a sigh and opened her eyes				565.3673951209863
he had the resolution to stop with this				737.8251236523832
it is very soon to leave me he thought but he follows the common custom				18918.952267894463

he told me that he should henceforth recruit his musketeers from among the guards of monsieur the cardinal the guards of the cardinal				288.2523982608851
mousqueton sighed again more deeply than before				833.3826948501845
the soldiers looked at dantès with an air of stupid curiosity				3460.3667777155
morrel evidently discomposed came to meet monte cristo less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry				63370.4636325709
athos who had till that time said nothing for fear that d artagnan interrupted in his turn should not have the time necessary from this moment declared that his name was athos and not d artagnan				55.071963989238874
this is the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following subject which has not yet been treated upon and in which i perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration utraque manus in benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est d artagnan whose erudition we are well acquainted with evinced no more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m de tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that d artagnan had received from the duke of buckingham				1047.4999918144588
without appearing to have heard the dialogue of which she had not lost a word she began again giving to her voice all the charm all the power all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it for all my tears my cares my exile and my chains i have my youth my prayers and god who counts my pains her voice of immense power and sublime expression gave to the rude unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most exalted puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren and which they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their imagination				2867.7149563441235
have you anything nothing the devil said aramis				28.59123097130557
she passed the night thus				2838.672426361699

this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you i thank you from the depths of my heart said the young man taking the spoon from the hands of monte cristo				249.58766089027745
barrois touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string				14327.004562810056
at the same time he pointed to a window through the shutters of which a faint light streamed				83457.13873256744
dantès followed him with his eyes and stretched forth his hands towards the open door but the door closed				3069.641162241669
i should like to offer him a last salute				88785.87821896297

the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters				68028.8052139025
yes replied d artagnan from this very day and mind if the wine is bad we will send him to find better we must use and not abuse said aramis sententiously				78372.76778085763
nature has made us thus she makes the young look ever forward not behind				2510.367923985668
the artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul she collected her features and in a complaining voice said in the name of heaven sir tell me if it is to you if it is to your government if it is to an enemy i am to attribute the violence that is done me no violence will be offered to you madame and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in england then you don t know me sir it is the first time i have had the honor of seeing you and on your honor you have no cause of hatred against me none i swear to you there was so much serenity coolness mildness even in the voice of the young man that milady felt reassured				8422.628362366682
well then your eminence said the queen becoming impatient what is your answer madame cried mazarin more and more moved will your majesty permit me to give you counsel speak sir replied the queen the counsels of so prudent a man as yourself ought certainly to be available madame believe me the king ought to defend himself to the last he has done so sir and this last battle which he encounters with resources much inferior to those of the enemy proves that he will not yield without a struggle but in case he is beaten well madame in that case my advice i know that i am very bold to offer advice to your majesty my advice is that the king should not leave his kingdom				6662.320062521385

the pistol i had heard had doubtless been fired at her				191.40729480206025
milady wished to please the abbess				58105.32928998352
are you ready sir he said at last				3717.139874913912
at last after crossing the courts of the palais royal where there still remained some of the conveyances of late guests they entered the garden and reached the little gate				1097.2556043831855
yes i hope so at least				2053.8217785063034
all at once he raised his head his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who has formed a resolution he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that was about to strike ten and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that stood upon the table near him he shrilled it twice				3678.5212393853194
but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this since dantès shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in prison				1234.6545408215488
how replied d artagnan you care little if she kills buckingham or causes him to be killed				1928.6888511713655
at the same moment a well known voice above him pronounced these words colonel i want to speak to the people athos shuddered from head to foot				1307.5394487841763
my wife and child shall escape from this gulf carrying treasures with them she will live and may yet be happy since her child in whom all her love is centred will be with her				201.36391479709508

it had been d artagnan s practice ever since the riots to sleep in the same room as porthos and on this eventful morning he was still there sleeping and dreaming that a yellow cloud had overspread the sky and was raining gold pieces into his hat which he held out till it was overflowing with pistoles				2098.6914474607574
i am brutal i not only allow it but boast of it it is one of the reasons of my success in commercial business				2402.1950503845337

goodnight and before dantès could open his mouth before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the water before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was the jailer disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the door leaving stamped upon the prisoner s mind the dim reflection of the dripping walls of his dungeon				4531.20043414
it was the cannon which announced the closing of the port				5972.43531959975

he laughs best who laughs last				4146.563548769478
she allowed the vessel to pass lorient and brest without repeating her request to the captain who on his part took care not to remind her of it				94.2412426981365
dantès had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yard arm he would not die by what seemed an infamous death				702.6123229717708

see paragraph c below				2272.6667958825237
the prisoner expected that he would be at no expense that day for like an economical man he had concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his cell				1518.3049205922225
finally he slept				3270.540350349598
that little stout man short and elderly that sort of lackey dressed in dark clothes treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the escort was bonacieux himself				183.67811185193358

the lady with the red cushion produced a great effect for she was very handsome upon the lady with the black hood who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded a great effect upon porthos who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood a great effect upon d artagnan who recognized in her the lady of meung of calais and of dover whom his persecutor the man with the scar had saluted by the name of milady				593.6517894454083

oh i assure you sir it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three				5518.481870598344

had she one redeeming trait				97797.0974348234
it seemed to the prisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there mercédès dwelt				31566.022330120748
he drew near to the window and placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as he held it he drew it from his pocket and read it again but he had not been mistaken the appointment was for ten o clock				1025.3935449956473
take him out and shoot him the prisoner turned pale				735.8754414965399

dantès cast from solitude into the world frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night in the silence of immensity and under the eye of heaven				603.7228726458998
this is recent news sir continued she and i thank you for having made such haste to bring it to me without this letter i should not have heard till to morrow perhaps after to morrow the last of all paris madame said raoul the louvre is but the second palace this news has reached it is as yet unknown to all and i had sworn to the count de guiche to remit this letter to your majesty before even i should embrace my guardian your guardian				101891.50958132627

yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable				106839.54865153687
an hour after her table was cleared but milady remarked that this time felton did not accompany the soldiers				2437.5645682939116
tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny morrel to pray sometimes for a man who like satan thought himself for an instant equal to god but who now acknowledges with christian humility that god alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom				44692.09664698038
yes we must put the madman with the madmen the soldiers seized dantès who followed passively				118908.95051832737
the bandits looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps				16789.259478159882
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three years faithfully served him and as he had saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have pity on him				34.19233497329769
but is this all that is known they are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him on his track said villefort				359.7390248489322
thou wouldst not have thought so hadst thou known mousqueton well so far so well answered planchet alighting and extending his arms to mousqueton the two servants embraced with an emotion which touched those who were present and made them suppose that planchet was a great lord in disguise so highly did they estimate the position of mousqueton				1226.4093729158014
danglars looked radiant with joy the banker accompanied him to the door				191.31960431905773
well monsieur said planchet who had observed his master grow red and pale successively did i not guess truly				27031.84898550482
he guessed something uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead				515.1441448715963
here doctor said he is what you sent me for was this prepared in your presence yes replied the procureur				3324.7727622748453
he glanced mechanically towards the piazza the scene was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the people remained full of noise and excitement				6045.522604503013
at ten o clock anne of austria had entered the king s room				186.30063369486527
before this room to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back staircase the servants passed with curiosity and bertuccio with terror				1183.8110504248311
with him they will be gentle and docile as lambs ali had indeed given proof of this for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths				26865.46614356948
did not touch those hearts of stone not one man stirred so monsieur de beaufort was obliged to be satisfied with calling them all kinds of rascals underneath the sun				2760.316073384543

no no be easy on that score				44877.28698799192

just so why he is a second ariosto no his name is the count of monte cristo there is no count of monte cristo said debray				428.2792141874196
but it seems to me said monte cristo and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if m noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested he can not have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward true said madame de villefort with an intonation of voice which it is impossible to describe is it not unjust shamefully unjust				18469.489386413596
the thieves had already approached andrea some screaming la savate la savate a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an iron heeled one				798.2346571310136
but she had her son				913.2132232574862
france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you will not find in its eighty five departments i say eighty five because i do not include corsica you will not find then in these eighty five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp				104495.57702943168
franz let him proceed without interruption and in fact did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred				156446.4794161026
they passed in silence through the little village of festubert where the wounded servant was and then skirted the wood of richebourg				133522.31382799227
but neither of these two wounds was serious and they only fought more earnestly				5235.507542827212
but allow me to say that you must have been very young then i was four years old but as those events deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory in what manner could these events concern you				60.348482559312224
the prisoner heard the cry which sounded like the sob of a broken heart and leaning from the coach he called out good bye mercédès we shall soon meet again then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of fort saint nicholas				122109.23352772376
well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to study diplomacy with the minister s secretary				3695.842850168686

i will wear it i swear to you as a grateful man should do tis well arise vicomte embrace me raoul arose and threw himself with emotion into the count s arms				505.58858558641106
suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of the carnival sounded and at the same instant all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment				12878.542986504499
de villefort said louis xviii the duc de blacas assures me you have some interesting information to communicate sire the duke is right and i believe your majesty will think it equally important in the first place and before everything else sir is the news as bad in your opinion as i am asked to believe sire i believe it to be most urgent but i hope by the speed i have used that it is not irreparable speak as fully as you please sir said the king who began to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in blacas s face and affected villefort s voice				879.4593691290187
a fine name said morrel				247.48244852885568
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious name and in the absence of the paternal hand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar now my father is not coming to paris is he he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling i understand well i am come to ask a favor of you of me yes of you and pray what may it be well to take his part ah my dear sir				839.1555812381629
the marechal de grammont and the comte de guiche had returned to paris and he was quite lonely				26287.840241039215
then an invincible and extreme terror seized upon him and he dared not again press the hand that hung out of bed he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant eyes which he tried many times to close but in vain they opened again as soon as shut				10940.347723924082
what news exclaimed a general burst of voices				24375.611592744022
there is so much fog in that detestable country at least so d artagnan declares just as the quaint conclusion reached by porthos was about to bring back hilarity to faces now more or less clouded hasty footsteps were heard upon the stair and some one knocked at the door				181.20047851630062
but his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act				4017.9103264649307
d artagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point was not at more than three paces from it				87.83374334575187
the comte de la fere he cried in his turn				1014.5874911829264
this man your highness when he saw me stop before his shop where he has a display of things which would make your mouth water my lord asked me to get him the custom of the prisoners in the donjon				119896.20796487061
two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his hand but albert a first rate pugilist sent them rolling in the street one after the other and continued his course towards the church of san giacomo				45686.36301276156
what planchet is monsieur d artagnan here here i am my friend dear athos cried d artagnan in a faltering voice and almost staggering from agitation				4938.9573017404855
you remind me said the priest that the young man concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the name of edmond said to bear the name repeated caderousse becoming excited and eager				145242.2024322362
laporte said the duke in a dying voice laporte do you come from her yes monseigneur replied the faithful cloak bearer of anne of austria but too late perhaps silence laporte you may be overheard				10810.17710307473
chapter lxxix				90503.18269190853
what do i see that he wouldn t swear swear what that man wanted aramis to swear that we are not going to the place royale to fight and aramis wouldn t swear no attention then athos did not lose sight of the two speakers				139334.5426931454
there is the port he murmured				6774.449005365724
i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight				2409.0110005945135
the next morning as soon as he awoke danglars asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on l impartial the paper of which beauchamp was the chief editor				107983.8479039277
but on my soul it looks so				327.86097586392896
chapter lvii				7345.352239501911
do you say resumed d artagnan that you suspect that impertinent gentleman i tell you i am sure of it continued the host				588.184050139728
i know what i wish to know follow me the three musketeers passed behind his eminence who again enveloped his face in his cloak and put his horse in motion keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions				1494.2754862500199
that man has sagacity honor and wit not to mention likewise that he is a man of undoubted resolution				5857.169320661914
they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans				88008.53315207345
your eminence said comminges as i was re conducting the young man for whom you have asked he approached the glass door of the gallery and gazed intently upon some object doubtless the picture by raphael which is opposite the door				157.71680150172926
hunting for the equipments the most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly d artagnan although he in his quality of guardsman would be much more easily equipped than messieurs the musketeers who were all of high rank but our gascon cadet was as may have been observed of a provident and almost avaricious character and with that explain the contradiction so vain as almost to rival porthos				228.9869004714358
however it does not signify he has a letter of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his money then throwing himself back in his carriage danglars called out to his coachman in a voice that might be heard across the road to the chamber of deputies apprised in time of the visit paid him monte cristo had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the baron by means of an excellent lorgnette as danglars himself had scrutinized the house garden and servants				6513.693858760016

milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury screaming in a formidable way				932.4631094685196
ah my dear athos i am greatly afraid i have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us d artagnan then related all the mad passion of milady and her menaces of death				657.895495183204
if the king had desired that the letter should be given to him madame he would have demanded it of you himself				175.0320267952488
listen then returned rochefort as he spoke endeavoring to read in that subtle countenance the cardinal s motive				57240.3977521095
only leave him in the ante room as i wish to speak to you alone d artagnan bowed and thought both at the same hour both commands alike both at the palais royal				2340.9949231659234
be it so said athos yet it is probable on the contrary that we shall enter because we seem to have to do with sensible people				1457.9223127547932
bonacieux the one he had just picked up				1125.9103195178236
but to return to these registers true this story has diverted our attention from them				103.1362264361957

do you not perceive that we are opposite the hôtel d arguillon which is full of the cardinal s creatures				2214.1087858554865
suddenly she heard a step she knew turned anxiously around the door opened and fernand dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant stood before her				168.05806417756156
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot it now occupied				27041.15701609763
you can not be speaking seriously athos said he the king is surrounded by an army which is conducting him to london				3512.2728095025195
in the morning milady under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest sent away the woman who attended her				202.14923548127723

go on d artagnan				31.626201217523345
julie hesitated				3034.052364369635

the weak man talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of treasures he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter				6869.702365548599
if i were not in such haste and if i were not running after someone said d artagnan				37.008306850802086
whilst all this was going on a cavalier in full gallop was seen approaching				5435.164496853088
danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in paris another ten minutes about his daughter travelling with mademoiselle d armilly the same period was given to his creditors and the manner in which he intended spending their money and then having no subject left for contemplation he shut his eyes and fell asleep				2032.1893182291462
and the duke furious against the cardinal				327.71530280788295
disguised as a coachman exclaimed mazarin				256.1626532071089

they search her she resists they use force the scoundrels in spite of his prudence d artagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below				2096.2640707359524
look said d artagnan day is declining				39145.65187208073
but how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this marriage a smile lit up the old man s face a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face				623.7882967559141
another gasconade murmured the gentleman				865.2798151711606
it was mercédès leaning on her son s arm and leaving the house				509.40577326142943
yet the parisian world is so strange that even all this might not have won attention had there not been connected with it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune				1161.7502591431721
where am i to die said she				147.69982982254805
for the rest the storm which raged within her doubled her strength and she would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to take for a single instant the proportions of her mind				707.6817964425026
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with fear				1249.9971725056892
dantès raised himself up and began to talk about everything about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in order to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his jailer who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner				1262.4264970939512
there s what you want on that table said the waiter				37546.7239273339
behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive with leaping flames great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the polished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments of the lonely tenant of the room which was illumined grandly by twin candelabra rich with wax lights				21231.16364792955
luigi was not mistaken				1672.318979621189
d artagnan smiled this jealous anger of milady was his revenge				6440.269465587554
morrel was dreaming and monte cristo was looking at the dreamer				75134.53025753186
i have worn it in my turn and it has sometimes not been disgraced when the hilt was in my hand and the sheath at my side				674.7426377698268
take care my cries are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another part of the prison and we be separated forever				4964.92175367225
who goes there inquired the captain of the patrol				5404.091199955887
will you go up with me i follow you monte cristo entered the tower which was divided into three stories				15359.803306446851
au revoir benedetto and running into a court he disappeared				601.2602231297697
oh i am very presuming i am aware				110545.24360421034
i am fifteen years younger than he is				1384.064172988129

dantès folded his hands raised his eyes to heaven and prayed fervently				30830.44437726884
but noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive me you still leave me the love which i have always enjoyed ah yes most assuredly said the eyes of the paralytic for he closed them with an expression which valentine could not mistake				7793.358264463141
at this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage which at the approach of the musketeers set off at a gallop				1596.6451770991448
the apartment of m bonacieux then became a mousetrap and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal s people				1460.4125275457166
the countess in reply bowed gracefully to albert and extended her hand with cordial kindness to franz then inviting albert to take the vacant seat beside her she recommended franz to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the one behind her own chair				696.5082482806184
you say you were on the point of being made captain of the pharaon yes and about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl yes now could anyone have had any interest in preventing the accomplishment of these two things				2304.6626973752445
the trees of the garden were easily seen from the steps of the street door				194.8053372880399
d artagnan on his return sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the guards with strict orders that great care should be taken of it and then on the day appointed as the dinner was fixed for midday d artagnan sent planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment				70986.44461774745
but how can that be				723.6381380599032
he might perhaps have been bought for less but while d artagnan was discussing the price with the dealer athos was counting out the money on the table				682.3825468822514
then when she had no longer any doubt she cried in a state of stupor what my brother is it you yes fair lady replied lord de winter making a bow half courteous half ironical it is i myself but this castle then is mine this chamber is yours i am then your prisoner nearly so but this is a frightful abuse of power no high sounding words				700.9154298122583
is it mazarin s proximity that makes you so prudent oh you hear that flamarens said chatillon				22908.378665980923
the officiating priest was just finishing mass whilst d artagnan was looking at bazin he pronounced the words of the holy sacrament and retired giving the benediction which was received by the kneeling communicants to the astonishment of d artagnan who recognized in the priest the coadjutor himself the famous jean francois gondy who at that time having a presentiment of the part he was to play was beginning to court popularity by almsgiving				131741.8978287371
but here is the letter very well said the prince give it to me later				8108.17808446735

we must play the farce to the end				735.9372012128039
help cried a voice whose mournful accents reaching the four friends seemed to proceed from some phantom of the ocean				1389.03740518788
aramis awaited him with that terrible smile which was peculiar to him on such occasions and athos who saw the duke advancing toward aramis with the rapidity of lightning was just going to cry out fire				1630.9233527805634
every day luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from palestrina to borgo every day at nine o clock in the morning the priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the priest s breviary				11796.778224278922
but continued d artagnan you shall judge of him for yourself				926.0487649027416
it is impossible said the procureur				3513.3180290791
d artagnan could on no account consent to pull his bed to pieces again for porthos but for a consideration of four louis that the latter paid him for it he consented that porthos should share his couch with him				34.41386513463694

five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the walls dug into niches which were arranged one above the other in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs				63003.00184601015
during this time the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the way the criminal strove to rise but ere he had time the mace fell on his left temple				40515.42085620731
it would be noble to see mademoiselle noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz d épinay villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had just uttered				5952.550429751869

he looked at d artagnan with an expression of gratitude and then bestowed on raoul one of those strange smiles of which children are so proud when they receive them				106.74309201396973
remember that olivain bowed and slipped the crown into his pocket				1328.07953580917

each time he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy				6942.922385387048
at this moment ali entered				564.3646086883479
athos perceiving that she knew him pushed the window with his knee and hand				200.13032752744962
if not i will apply to the chancellor i will apply to the king i will apply to the hangman i will move the courts against you i will denounce you as branded i will bring you to trial and if you are acquitted well by the faith of a gentleman i will kill you at the corner of some wall as i would a mad dog i like the means well enough said d artagnan but where and how to meet with her time dear friend time brings round opportunity opportunity is the martingale of man				149.9636101797946

madame morrel looked again through the keyhole morrel was writing but madame morrel remarked what her daughter had not observed that her husband was writing on stamped paper				1161.0541329125983
morrel had thought of danglars who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to morrel in former days since to him it was owing that danglars entered the service of the spanish banker with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth				34954.13289050877

yes do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is introducing said morcerf				717.9379278589013

after reading the first lines of the letter mazarin gave a side glance at him to see if he was watching the expression of his face as he read				12606.850311627137
she had been there some moments and had heard the last words of the visitor				3524.799017132608
franz and the count descended these and found themselves in a mortuary chamber				545.2496602884829

they pitied the young king who was unconsciously ruining his country and threw all the odium of his proceedings on mazarin				516.3747944199409
at one time he thought he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice to the two gendarmes he is not here but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased attention				1147.204649555125

madame bonacieux presented her cheek to him				34.094324574386555
what would you have said monte cristo we are all mortal				8765.141500003618
at this announcement during which the door remained open everyone became mute and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of the length of the antechamber and entered the apartment of the captain of the musketeers congratulating himself with all his heart at having so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel				5334.697072605838
i know that porthos was in a fair way replied d artagnan and as to aramis to tell you the truth i have never been seriously uneasy on his account				1954.018683978396

as we have already said milady was admirably acquainted with this part of france				563.3773013220767

as for raoul he remained bewildered with what he had seen having been forbidden by d artagnan to leave the room until the tumult was over				1393.017163456639
and with his lackey he took the road to the governor s country house				510.76590276854904
whereupon grimaud observing the duke s disappointment drew from his pocket a purse filled with gold and handed it to him				34.0288050935988

then he turned again to the clock counting time now not by minutes but by seconds				16225.692087539916
the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos who urged on his horse against one of them				113.55744867486122
the tie is even more direct it seems to me oh madame said villefort deeply affected in spite of himself do not yield to those gloomy thoughts you will long live with us happy loved and honored and we will make you forget never never never said the marchioness				45724.89505399891

and yet since the amusement seemed to me rather tame i proposed to chevalier de rieux that we should be spectators instead of actors and in order to see to advantage that we should mount the bronze horse				909.8143139694212
the musketeers trotted up and at the same time the ten men whom d artagnan had given to comminges appeared				1151.2148063083562
eight vigorous arms lifted him up immediately and laid him in the boat where directly athos was warmed and reanimated reviving with the caresses and cares of his friends who were intoxicated with joy				1124.870334672329

he gave me this paper it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and monte cristo passed a paper to albert				344.2319647669449
notwithstanding that assurance morrel still hesitated				2900.3138492810185
the face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her				200.90029929617936
but he bethought him of m de villefort s promise and besides death in a boat from the hand of a gendarme seemed too terrible				5809.621261666265

the noble and distinguished air of athos those flashes of greatness which from time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant companion in the world that forced and cynical gaiety that bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the rarest coolness such qualities attracted more than the esteem more than the friendship of d artagnan they attracted his admiration				2935.6382661193215

he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his hand the carbine which your emperor presented him				34.84157266977611
an intervening elevation of land hid the light				1189.010051506114
the spectre of valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less				14504.944540113356
neither mercédès nor edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other				405.18876559784826

madame de villefort wiped his forehead pressed her lips upon it and sent him back with the ball in one hand and some bonbons in the other				405.8847220105184
we are friends are we not egad				20509.98394918832
this costs us nothing and saves the life or at least the liberty of a fellow creature who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption ah said franz then you are a smuggler occasionally gaetano your excellency we must live somehow returned the other smiling impenetrably				102670.4822884403

d artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry				149512.9431962526
the man in the red cloak the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that extraordinary man				145.15619693013065
at that period buckingham was an ally and not an enemy				1125.720818282394
let us see said he i have swum above an hour but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen				16232.873624331027
the nobleman to whom he applied being a friend of porthos was very ready not to sell them as was proposed but to lend them				106.8057671653421
all three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert				21239.730117035724
as for grimaud his hair stood on end and drops of sweat ran down his brow				456.05391895082187
porthos opened his mouth to reply d artagnan made him a sign and his mouth remaining silent gradually closed				3117.9452944740037
at this moment the whole regiment came up and they fell upon the few men who had held out surrounding the two frenchmen				11299.92087543973
as for porthos he looked inquiringly at d artagnan				38.315635458407804
the general alighted leaning on the arm of the president of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly room				193.0040258717058
d artagnan and planchet mounted and took the road to st germain				3128.8294324639724
and stopped in the yard				13780.892142414232
musketeers cried d artagnan				7.867042139283988
now as the debate between these two nobles might last a long time each becoming naturally more firm in his own opinion m de tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate it quietly				5075.502359642761
the abbé the abbé murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering				95246.07581263324
has not his majesty just left you and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit search then monsieur				1033.5575302185016
and then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief				995.001548275231
why do we hate				86149.80376915666

what dreadful sufferings said julie remembering valentine but whom with a delicacy natural to women she did not name before her brother				2041.9504017629147
dantès remained a prisoner and heard not the noise of the fall of louis xviii s throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire				30097.078316445677
an old acquaintance replied grimaud				366.08948850136045
you will appear at this ball yes with those studs yes the queen s paleness if possible increased the king perceived it and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides of his character				9393.092649840779

immediately without any order being given or his place of destination indicated the coachman set off at a rapid pace and plunged into the streets of the city				1005.535705412314
well said the count				189.70550727563668
therefore scarcely had the stranger time to pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival				9547.966518815045
then obeying the orders given him by athos he headed the small procession bearing the torch in one hand and the musket in the other until it reached de winter s inn when pounding on the portal with his fist he bowed to my lord and faced about without a word				505.28635734051846
thank him then madame if you have any affection for me milady frowned slightly a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man who saw and observed this triple shade almost shuddered at it				92.83243102799706
he thought of his wife				1217.6489645889542
what must be done then asked the general i have my carriage here said the president				1162.1248003129563
only let us lodge with some one on whom we can count for i imagine just now that noll cromwell would not be inclined to trifle with us				359.63971867325836
it is singular said d artagnan whilst the boat was taking them to the standard it is astonishing how that young man resembles some one i must have known but who it was i can not yet remember a few minutes later they were on board but the embarkation of the horses was a longer matter than that of the men and it was eight o clock before they raised anchor				11346.700997441903
the president again arose and having imposed silence said sir you are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you the general putting his hand on his sword exclaimed if you talk of honor do not begin by disavowing its laws and impose nothing by violence and you sir continued the president with a calmness still more terrible than the general s anger i advise you not to touch your sword the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said i will not swear then you must die replied the president calmly				3719.8066265510856
now said gondy there is a communion between us				353.01124107023344
he will see us if we go out then you must come up into my room ah said mme				125.89032253048941
i ll circulate that saying be assured my dear fellow				1993.1265054606954
kill the fellow and rejoin us as soon as you can all three remounted their horses and set out at a good pace while porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the thrusts known in the fencing schools				96147.66270629066
and who knows it noirtier looked at the door where the servant had gone out				496.3319083777531
de wardes i know it cried d artagnan				7.283420426733239
he wished to have the young man at hand not that he at all mistrusted him but for the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the queen				377.6686339512751
one said the grave diggers two				1518.7784800976742
morrel shuddered he thought he heard a sob				38252.266182709114
i can not calmly say with you providence has struck the blow but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he will kill me				72.66886242847437

he will set out upon receiving an order from me without knowing what he carries and he will carry your majesty s letter without even knowing it is from your majesty to the address which is on it the queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of emotion gazed at her as if to read her very heart and seeing nothing but sincerity in her beautiful eyes embraced her tenderly				2486.324017044144
i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in the trenches tonight and that you did not get much the best of the rochellais d artagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation				566.0595817771073
d artagnan took up his camp tin cup filled it with wine and arose				2486.7473021604987
that s my masterpiece				233922.5332481648
this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as possible whenever he met him or from asking in the kindest tone well monsieur cardinal how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor bernajoux of yours chapter vii				3720.0691496334416
now is that all i believe so let us see buckingham dead or grievously wounded your conversation with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers lord de winter warned of your arrival at portsmouth d artagnan and athos to the bastille aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse porthos an ass madame bonacieux found again to send you the chaise as soon as possible to place my lackey at your disposal to make you out a victim of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion armentières on the banks of the lys				11350.261683868492
yes my lord ah that is true said de guiche i had forgotten it that is easily understood it was you who took him count said raoul smiling				817.7395786651667

confound you and your punctuality said andrea throwing himself into a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at the head of his host				594.1397284861348
only tell us where we shall find a house at which we can demand aid and a village from which we can fetch a priest thank you and god reward you				67.56711594559735

the sound was heard by the people about ali who instantly opened the box door				186.26474778539077
it was evident from his pale face and knit brows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker				33687.58989491809
chapter lxvi				18868.374644859956
compression is needed to explode gunpowder				24509.318285703223
order my lord he said i am ready to obey your eminence monsieur d artagnan continued the cardinal you performed sundry superb exploits in the last reign your eminence is too good to remember such trifles in my favor				1764.2333220962316
really i might even say that we have some reason to praise him impossible yes really it is owing to him that we are free owing to him yes he had us conducted into the orangery by monsieur bernouin his valet de chambre and from there we followed him to visit the comte de la fere				4467.038473502846
if they recognize you you are lost care not for me sire think only of yourself				904.4075275563202
the king could not give that order since at that time he was hardly four years old yes but i could give him the order i guitant and i preferred to give it to you guitant without reply rode forward and desired the sentinel to call monsieur de villequier				96230.40587758315
you now understand haydée said the count that from this moment you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country as it may suit your inclination				123545.08382845602
the parliament condemned charles to death as might have been foreseen				3170.508978935442
shall i help you madame asked athos				7.502328878930182
bonacieux sorrowfully				3820.022490123952
you were right he said my dear monsieur d artagnan and you can not set out yet				1545.675667877484
the sport was bad franz only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the boat very much out of temper				11837.777841243927
mon dieu				5870.764231137789
when the young man on board saw this person approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ship s bulwarks				80566.0833908142
all the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy between life and death which renders it similar to a kind of station between this world and the next a sublime spot a resting place full of poetry and character and at which franz had already halted five or six times and at each time found it more marvellous and striking				14039.836145426152
and who is the cause of all this annoyance my father as i told you m				599.3486641739643
besides of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch				3493.255411529068

pray don t heed him sir he only barks he never bites				207928.65488740048
a man wrapped in a cloak appeared at the door but seeing a stranger he beckoned to his companions and two men who were drinking in the inn went out to speak to him				33.421642608027426
i raised my head i was in utter darkness				1283.814935878151
bonacieux darting to the window can it be he milady remained still in bed petrified by surprise so many unexpected things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a loss				11371.736038649477

the vessel resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the water				805.6292811434613
it had been resolved the night before to change their encampment				163506.9891204394
because tomorrow haydée you will be free you will then assume your proper position in society for i will not allow my destiny to overshadow yours				2857.405311016078

villefort franz and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary				81708.71508617332
he had almost forgotten his name and face but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it the face encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear				3292.484280603154
the one between the pillars on the first tier it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh did you observe anyone during the first act asked château renaud				2046.3210439907798
yes yes said lord de winter who perceived what was passing in her mind yes you look for the signature and you say to yourself all is not lost for that order is not signed				22327.90945602586
as he passed by m noirtier s room he perceived two figures through the half open door but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his father anxiety carried him on further				5429.331147186668
valentine promised all that morrel required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that she should not marry franz				819.1343717184968
and now said athos unless monsieur cardinal should form the ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud i think we may be pretty much at our ease respecting the letter meantime his eminence continued his melancholy ride murmuring between his mustaches these four men must positively be mine chapter lii				12625.138264011664
before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some friends to reward				21959.181284304374
but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which was familiar to d artagnan and a well known voice said monsieur i have brought your cloak it is chilly this evening planchet cried d artagnan beside himself with joy				1107.4435101906604
ah said d artagnan who began to understand				661.7528318024713

tis true that he came the next morning to my house thinking that he had to do with an abbé like all other abbés and what was the end of the affair we met in the place royale egad				22648.31226206669
when the count thought franz had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his finger to his lips to warn him to be silent and ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the chamber by the middle arcade and advanced towards vampa who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the noise of his footsteps				15334.482727493347
order whatever you like for supper the only thing i specify is one of those pies and tell the confectioner that i will promise him my custom if he excels this time in his pies not only now but when i leave my prison then you think you will some day leave it said la ramee				1530.2364830510242

yes said she it is madame danglars and her daughter who have come to call on us				368.60027505205744
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy when they could but lament the absence of dantès whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially				155422.90588810894
on the landing d artagnan blushed in the antechamber he trembled				4287.698395747859
edmond resigned the lugger to the master s care and went and lay down in his hammock but in spite of a sleepless night he could not close his eyes for a moment				544.7034239662477
one single solitary light was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was selim s flaming lance				10466.946626394672
night came and at ten o clock they anchored				110200.72829039367
at his house rebellion could be planned with impunity for as we have said since that morning he had ceased to be the queen s invalid as to raoul he had attended the duchess to her carriage where as she took her seat she gave him her hand to kiss then by one of those wild caprices which made her so adorable and at the same time so dangerous she had suddenly put her arm around his neck and kissed his forehead saying vicomte may my good wishes and this kiss bring you good fortune then she had pushed him away and directed the coachman to stop at the hotel de luynes				30229.372447874855
and you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you the old man nodded				16707.209623106497
barrois made some steps towards his master				1364.5841940970158

that king who was so grand so sublime in the hour of death meeting his fate with a smile of resignation on his lips now in that gloomy hour wiped away a tear which had fallen on the table and quivered on the gold embroidered cloth				13607.771979292116
the two musketeers were already there and were playing together				625.8977692557336
a light moved rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor				1262.2302695185874
the prince had supplied him with fifty light horse not so much by way of guard as to show the deputies how readily the queen s generals dispersed their troops and to prove that they might be safely scattered at pleasure				1330.9628079419817
years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the present				6165.694713113701
as he touched the ground he opened his eyes				582.3813718186434
by its influence time has no longer measure space has no longer distance				2167.5465501422764
it is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m franz d épinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own will again you drive me to despair maximilian said valentine again you plunge the dagger into the wound				3951.5953272631364
well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you				45.95807020754075
you would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald green sea you would like very well either on land or on the ocean to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning				69618.08984525413
porthos cried athos and laughed aloud				14986.061180961056
these last consisted of all the young people whom valentine s death had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable girl thus cut off in the flower of her youth				2212.5014328675256
s blood cried he to d artagnan do not kill him young man i beg of you				62.494581731430905
savate an old shoe				227538.64666988698
no doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness and which ran as follows madame and most faithful wife debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness whose face became covered with blushes				126889.50278767108
the cardinal accompanied his majesty from surgères to mauzes and there the king and his minister took leave of each other with great demonstrations of friendship				10223.378285196684
thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged countenance lit up with happiness looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of parading the newly opened gardens of the luxembourg and tuileries				160888.86463469005
meanwhile danglars repressing all emotion advanced to meet the receiver general				1400.6361919059689
never mind				716.711689220799
why it is after one o clock your home is a paradise porthos one takes no note of time				695.2068869178302
well then asked athos in a low tone				542.9548446103965
i believe the fellow is here on his own account for i have heard that these gentlemen born beyond the tweed are very vindictive				83145.56615851744
were i but a frenchman				6943.2402144259895
well said the other if this last resource fail you well returned morrel it is a cruel thing to be forced to say but already used to misfortune i must habituate myself to shame				3905.3418246595465
monte cristo took the glass drank half its contents and then presented it to valentine who smiled and swallowed the rest				1026.5020948450403
the evening of the betrothal villefort had as we have said hastened back to madame de saint méran s in the place du grand cours and on entering the house found that the guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon				3769.405389507772
and where is auteuil asked the count				328.017975083388
the cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king with an air of condolence very displeasing to me that the day before yesterday those damned musketeers those daredevils he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me those braggarts added he glancing at me with his tiger cat s eye had made a riot in the rue férou in a cabaret and that a party of his guards i thought he was going to laugh in my face had been forced to arrest the rioters				255167.2792999805
let us come to some conclusion				18061.648408367742
well did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a coward				1115.5429538211297
the bastion st gervais replied d artagnan from behind which the rochellais annoyed our workmen was that affair hot yes moderately so				422.7177797960836
they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within when someone knocked at the yard shutter they demanded who was there and recognizing the voices of their lackeys opened the shutter				20053.50841943676
m coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities				120666.70794803031
edmond then resolved to try jacopo and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize money but jacopo refused it indignantly				88302.27886397013
to imprison him monseigneur				2826.3868841819167
yes you see i am as exact as you are				872.3723961213415
ah said milady listening in her turn to the noise of felton s steps which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of lord de winter at length you are mine then her brow darkened				97267.84785484127
read me something m debray she said				319.7350778362473
meanwhile by a cleft between two walls of rock following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human foot had never before trod dantès approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed				8414.8725941755
at the moment of arriving at st paul the spot where such as were condemned at the bastille were executed he was near fainting and crossed himself twice				3787.2271952080428
what said porthos				11.603472836114186
my father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my mother reclining by his side rested her head on his shoulder and i played at his feet admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance				4522.691172483064
no replied d artagnan if i recollect well what you said it was nothing out of the common way ah you surprise me				90.62499696189118
their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future				1386.4731894099823
alas anything you please				8177.813282404718
as to the rest in eight days you will be where you ought to be and my task will be completed infamous task				9767.671467267852
a moment after caderousse s face appeared at the grating in the door				191.20232069341895
a gleam like a flash of lightning illumined the road and with the flash was heard the whistling of balls which were fired wildly in the air				1558.2628817240486
but said monte cristo do you not know any cause for this hatred ah ma foi who is to know perhaps it is some political difference my father and the baron d épinay lived in the stormy times of which i only saw the ending said villefort				267.9824255293312
what have you done with monsieur de bruy				163097.24519645682
he felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice				32292.962266986095
there he found madeleine alarmed for his safety and anxious to tell him all the events of the evening but he cut her short by ordering her to put his supper in his room and give him with it a bottle of good burgundy				177221.81063194302
the same evening the following was read in le messager by telegraph				28087.291964298867
had the unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his mind or at least have greatly astonished him				36.1553373793055
one ball struck the head of the already wounded guard and the other flattened itself against a rock after having passed within two inches of d artagnan				90.35557398963462
what do you say that my orders go far madame and that i am authorized to seek for the suspected paper even on the person of your majesty what horror cried the queen				364.429310030808
falconers are declining				36900.16065365967
how many people thought he and not one true friend and as he uttered these words of doubt and depression within his mind a voice beside him said respect to fallen majesty the king turned quickly around with tears in his eyes and heart				397.83856771214647
d artagnan took leave of milady and left the saloon the happiest of men				1211.3955397984746
this letter is not in your table nor in your secretary and yet this letter must be somewhere would you dare to lift your hand to your queen said anne of austria drawing herself up to her full height and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening				27222.981066645996
that which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time quite a simple and natural affair and the younger sons of the best families were frequently supported by their mistresses				281677.7974660887
your turn my lord said athos				5.455960491381411
marechal de la meilleraie returning without a hat fontrailles with his arm in a sling wounded guards horses bleeding eh then what are the sentinels about				3672.0859827077775
what do you want something to drink your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near rome then give me water cried danglars endeavoring to parry the blow				2404.004406259436
they proposed a game of bouillotte				204826.28860628317
but don t let us hinder you mousqueton go and perform your master s orders				6345.116316505982
felton did not enter				1423.0777032625272
bonacieux prophesied				323792.01971339504
he looked coldly at the queen who nudged mazarin to make him say something in his turn				1137.831502901777
but as villefort saw his father but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old man s happiness was centred in his granddaughter				16790.924755239183
name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must bring the goldsmith knew the duke				777.629352507471
m d avrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the mind				717.8759670866674
for heaven s sake madame said villefort with a firmness of expression not altogether free from harshness for heaven s sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch				3524.8191862520707
upon gaining this advantage d artagnan was near uttering a cry of surprise it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal visitor it was a woman				415.58886427748115
tis very dear living in england my lord especially as envoy extraordinary zounds replied mazarin the people there are very sedate and their habits since the revolution simple but no matter he opened a drawer and took out a purse				2313.180967847185
it was that of la carconte				2254.1486659534658
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still franz and the count were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of one another				1189.2402612438823
mousqueton cried d artagnan let us be off				1429.3847553338353
faria bent on him his penetrating eye				2866.0089075763185
you know i am not familiar with the french language which you monsieur le coadjuteur both speak and write so well this is a council of state d artagnan remarked to porthos but we held better ones at la rochelle with athos and aramis at the saint gervais bastion said porthos				183.61514935512335
perform your duty in camp i will do mine elsewhere				14507.628389034273
drops of perspiration trickled down his face and from time to time he put a handkerchief to his mouth to wipe away the blood that rilled from it				90.25877103764458
they will not dare to refuse me then and i will return to paris and will see you again and will be happy for an instant				1196.163895930426
one word which their landlady had pronounced had given a particular turn to d artagnan s deliberations this was the name of madame de longueville				2095.410606102833
bravo repeated the sailors				2102.159852408473
oh my god cried anne of austria with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell				8281.42618651377
non capisco do not understand was the reply				1123.61804863862
it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved daughter				1766.4269875012305
send me five hundred pistoles and four or five days after i have received them i shall be in paris on the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him				34.50037132598396
for my part i confess to you that i was all ready to follow them and am still ready to rejoin them in spite of all the mazarins in the world you would be right porthos but for one thing which may change the current of your ideas and that is that it is not those gentlemen who are in the greatest danger it is ourselves it is not to abandon them that we have separated but to avoid compromising them really said porthos opening his eyes in astonishment				2258.0193382979255
if on the contrary it is a prisoner the noise i make will alarm him he will cease and not begin again until he thinks everyone is asleep edmond rose again but this time his legs did not tremble and his sight was clear he went to a corner of his dungeon detached a stone and with it knocked against the wall where the sound came				2334.5428406752435
i believe and i repeat it to your majesty that the queen conspires against the power of the king but i have not said against his honor and i i tell you against both				9157.126890677262
besides this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner				1211.8045768320992
i will take him for judge in his own cause monsieur and will believe what he will say m de la trémouille reflected for an instant then as it was difficult to suggest a more reasonable proposal he agreed to it				75.06630373287352
the sermon over the procurator s wife advanced toward the holy font				19253.423794389317
but there was no getting at the place of sojourn of the future abbé the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well guarded as the gardens of armida				75574.478305937
we are going in order to win it to remain an hour in the bastion				2872.8378285465064
tell me his name edmond dantès villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol at five and twenty paces than have heard this name spoken but he did not blanch				89364.46179310042
the duke waited until midnight turning on his mattress like st laurence on his gridiron				166484.4839231034
tell vitray to come to me said he and tell him to get ready for a journey an instant after the man he asked for was before him booted and spurred				136660.6804757677
my dear albert said debray rising it is half past two				1380.46408943821
you are my friend today tomorrow you will be no more to me than a shadow or rather even you will no longer exist				2784.69686926707
dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the works of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels				87400.8784481947
it is deeply engraved on my heart and after what you have just said i remember that only château renaud and beauchamp looked at each other the impression was the same on both of them and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have become embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued				5664.043904480749
ah your excellency murmured the pilot you should not have done so our master will scold us for it the young man continued to advance following the sailors who chose a firm footing				155460.85556583232
as for myself i neither have nor desire to have a mistress following in that respect the very judicious example of athos who has none any more than i have but what the devil				574.8744825603934
and with how many fingers does he bless				177710.92871560855
but when the cowardly insulter spat in the face of the captive monarch athos grasped his dagger				10517.38733061804
excellent murmured monte cristo to himself as he came away				879.1570633268376
you must go then mademoiselle said emmanuel				5467.276706442245
you will one or other of you perhaps both return it to me at paris				475.59357518042464
what do i think captain				1659.5770914680284
and now my dear athos said he do me the kindness to tell me where we are going why you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion but what are we going to do there you know well that we go to breakfast there but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you				58.10676448644294
poor fellow he exclaimed				2065.800589005713
he is my demon apparently				367044.4158839799
he had my love				774.2117811112663
as we have said he was lying on the deck				4212.770305380155
i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days nor i said madame danglars but you began a sentence sir and did not finish which m				640.7368407804724
melancholy in a capitalist like the appearance of a comet presages some misfortune to the world i have been in ill luck for several days said danglars and i have heard nothing but bad news ah indeed said monte cristo				366.74119560965374
unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber but the eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night				902.6716686766962
the chancellor advanced therefore toward anne of austria and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air and now it remains for me to make the principal examination what is that asked the queen who did not understand or rather was not willing to understand				697.9591334472435
there is a congestion of prisoners in the bastile who were cooped up in the time of monsieur de richelieu i don t even know their names yes but in regard to myself my lord it can not be so for i was removed from the chatelet to the bastile owing to an order from your eminence you think you were i am certain of it ah stay				36002.4941949013
it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices				126210.39621174388
now i tell you you must pass with me through this army across to scotland and if you refuse you may choose betwixt two names which the contempt of all honest men will brand you with you are either cowards or traitors the eyes of the scotch flashed fire and as often happens on such occasions from shame they passed to effrontery and two heads of clans advanced upon the king				490.1886726960186
a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining room no one would have suspected that the count was as sportsmen would say keeping his hand in				939.5179783969913
the president s sword which was simply as he had said one he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the general s and had no guard				1006.2609357221893
his companions followed his example				2006.8794089195467
i do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors				151605.22037177908
i send them but like pilate washing my hands and what does mademoiselle d armilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil oh well i don t know but i understand that she is going to italy				4276.692507391426
the physician has a sacred mission on earth and to fulfil it he begins at the source of life and goes down to the mysterious darkness of the tomb				3477.0590265621763
felton in his rapid walk reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of james i and charles i furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the puritans				3437.9137097827793
the events which have taken place in my house though they now occupy the public mind will be forgotten in time or if indeed a few enemies should persist in remembering them why then i will add them to my list of crimes				3016.389980898593
go to your father go and see mercédès and afterwards come to me shall i row you ashore no thank you i shall remain and look over the accounts with danglars				544.0223059684487
his natural prudence however never forsook him for a single instant				1203.4881743819126
a strange thing is the mind and it is wonderful what revolutions may be wrought in it by a sign a word a hope				1319.2387723131337
we make in our case a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of iron in exchange for our money				1018.071932687888
you do not like dantès i never like upstarts then tell me all you know about the catalane i know nothing for certain only i have seen things which induce me to believe as i told you that the future captain will find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries what have you seen come tell me well every time i have seen mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping black eyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce air whom she calls cousin really and you think this cousin pays her attentions i only suppose so				436.5609477275775
they entered				631.8429227886085
each was anxious to gain admission before the other				410.0261944039829
fine spoil captain fine spoil said peppino in italian and taking danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door through which they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his dwelling place				588.1161807970263
once there for greater security the young man barricaded the door				188.70946796167436
your d artagnan				23.497246398344146
paris you can understand is astonished at the sight of such unusual splendor and the police have made inquiries well well				507.3776896580535
there were nobles who made war against each other there was the king who made war against the cardinal there was spain which made war against the king				549.9533885868705
the event which had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas				8128.323192998004
mazarin saw the smile and profited by the moment				544.7634260171462
as villefort observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between corsica where he was born and naples of which his brother in law is king and face to face with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son unfortunately said villefort there are the treaties of and we can not molest napoleon without breaking those compacts oh well we shall find some way out of it responded m de salvieux				153140.59647037613
courage the bell of the convent gate was sounded milady was not mistaken				1803.07469333524
i can scarcely credit it nevertheless it is quite true still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every way and calls for immediate correction but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a duty as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any person who would have introduced me into the fashionable world but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the idea so distinguished an individual as yourself cried albert could scarcely have required an introduction you are most kind but as regards myself i can find no merit i possess save that as a millionaire i might have become a partner in the speculations of m aguado and m rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable chance should present itself of carrying my wish into execution				2824.85628170783
edmond if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i thought you were living and since i have thought you must be dead				486.42014868819723
have my valise carried to the muid d amour rue des bourdonnais				205809.0379583565
he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him an englishman said monte cristo who grew uneasy at the attention with which julie looked at him				30.86540574596457
really villefort you surprise me				33.39796112552372
you grow a little too warm in my opinion about the fate of madame bonacieux				2740.157092315987
he will give you a horse all saddled and will point out to you the road you ought to take				8104.436388459823
his companions horror struck could neither move nor cry out				444.1402472208104
the two friends sat down and aramis began to cut up fowls partridges and hams with admirable skill				22059.764561708234
and you sir he said				274.13894137428906
oh women				3795.2900380812316
well said the baroness				2897.8269397389827
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief but her total inability to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act				4377.151135595681
adieu sir she said				240.4813766556483

lord wilmore having heard the door close after him returned to his bedroom where with one hand he pulled off his light hair his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black hair dark complexion and pearly teeth of the count of monte cristo				360.41104732615895
what would you have two men without arms do against eight armed men two men how do you mean yes the king and his lackey oh				615.7321115002223
but neither in the street he had passed through nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded could he see anyone however slowly the stranger had walked he was gone on his way or perhaps had entered some house				510.0776014455073
vampa gazed on him for a moment without betraying the slightest emotion while on the contrary teresa shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the shoulder of her lover				2979.9318901138954
they hang behead and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible manner but some of these like clever rogues have contrived to escape human justice and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems				101972.09645371331
they turned round and saw diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his arms				569.7839661637221
the departure the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all paris				520.540922970032
the day after monte cristo had called upon danglars the mysterious lodger entered at ten o clock in the morning instead of four in the afternoon				8981.844908248308
my dear count you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you speak thus said morcerf				721.6051595652934

than the son of peter mazarin				411.9253218801354
and you would be right my friend for in losing him you would lose your barony which you have in your grasp to say nothing of the fact that were he once out of this mazarin would have you hanged do you think so i am sure of it then i would kill him rather than let him go and you would act rightly				3355.073350991477
yes and no				522.216073507075

he turned				2984.140848829462
i have replied d artagnan pulling out his treasure from his pocket and placing it on the table				682.1596943119781
but i thought he said that your eminence knew that circumstance better than any one i				1177.673001975904
there was a moment at which he felt something like remorse				6099.403128028243
d artagnan however gathered from his equivocal replies that the road to the right was the one he ought to take and on that uncertain information he resumed his journey				2348.214927554118
mousqueton s horse which had traveled for five or six hours without a rider the day before might have been able to pursue the journey but by an inconceivable error the veterinary surgeon who had been sent for as it appeared to bleed one of the host s horses had bled mousqueton s				884.5584015036821
good day commander ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking hands with him				31.607039648242637
and where am i inquired monte cristo laughingly				22764.922661594268
and the king went out of the room without either embracing his mother or even bowing to the cardinal				300.36001461622675
he made fruitless efforts to go on it was impossible				1250.5701031062877
two or three times even to the great astonishment of his friends he had when aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him replaced a verb in its right tense and a noun in its case				3233.226666768986
no one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor				8003.6408625548165
everything in its proper time and all comes right to those who know how to wait patiently				24825.01198619184
ah your pardon said dantès frowning in his turn i did not perceive that there were three of us then turning to mercédès he inquired who is this gentleman one who will be your best friend dantès for he is my friend my cousin my brother it is fernand the man whom after you edmond i love the best in the world				693.9198688503891
indeed i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than the air of paris				507.46140660525396
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo				331.1028986824519

at one corner where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it though situated but a hundred paces off				1410.218100847711
pardieu said d artagnan you know you will not be my prisoner very long no said aramis they will doubtless treat us like the prisoners of the philipghauts and how were they treated asked d artagnan				39.90391036674143
he no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards				2125.9052112358845
then they were both silent				1116.7079616055487
he approached la ramee and showing him the crawfish hung up by the thread cardinal he said				441.8434943761512

five or six minutes elapsed				30586.34844488442
this kind of life fatigues and oppresses me besides he is a turbulent fellow who will ruin our party				8599.913035119962
which whichever of the three you like i have no preference and the rich caparison is that mine too without doubt you laugh d artagnan no i have left off laughing now that you speak french what those rich holsters that velvet housing that saddle studded with silver are they all for me for you and nobody else as the horse which paws the ground is mine and the other horse which is caracoling belongs to athos peste they are three superb animals i am glad they please you why it must have been the king who made you such a present certainly it was not the cardinal but don t trouble yourself whence they come think only that one of the three is your property i choose that which the red headed boy is leading it is yours good heaven				583.8500376684493
selim repeated from time to time the sacred words god is great however my mother had still some hope				1308.7820177466265

she then turned to the right followed the course of a long corridor descended a flight went a few steps farther introduced a key into a lock opened a door and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp saying remain here my lord duke someone will come she then went out by the same door which she locked so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner				1268.4878091975138
yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you				61.947099354053584

unfasten it or i will break it in said grimaud				534.8703513188487
the prisoner whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his family and then retiring to rest that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner				972.4317011384032

coquenard did not seem to observe it				71.70076870361162
as for andrea he began by way of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house had taken it to the outer door thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it				98.40234135994345

then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at liberty for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him				34.98189182401997
one day he miraculously left the prison transformed rich powerful				9141.87446883614
let me embrace him i am in a hurry to see him again pardon monsieur but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment why so				423.5884391585081

the count of monte cristo said danglars more pale from terror than he had been just before from hunger and misery				13396.49640421688
wrapped in this sweet idea d artagnan waited half an hour without the least impatience his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment				579.2509600832136
as to love the only woman he could have loved was mme				201.68083061827411

and this gentleman being disengaged takes to the service willingly he asked				1301.0030308039757
meanwhile his misgivings in regard to mousqueton recurred to his mind and with greater force because mousqueton though he did not himself wait on the table which would have been beneath him in his new position appeared at the door from time to time and evinced his gratitude to d artagnan by the quality of the wine he directed to be served				5290.477109133354
the marchioness drained the glass at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating the notary the notary m de villefort left the room and valentine seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother				71716.43612568783

morrel attributed penelon s embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense on his own account he was no doubt engaged on board some other vessel and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the pharaon longer				3974.335785104457

the salutation was so well understood that morrel with the same expression in his eyes placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose hearts beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each other by the whole length of the room forgot themselves for a moment or rather forgot the world in their mutual contemplation				17786.326458406355

two feet below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three times on the floor				1213.0435068169265
and how did this misfortune occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted conversation				573.2774799993399
this athos was connected with three young musketeers named porthos d artagnan and he stopped short				4518.500709474192
then all the members looked at each other with terror				1173.0895212474736
do you think they have recognized us said d artagnan				11.654718579900422

d artagnan examined the countenances of his companions which like that of athos wore an impression of deep anxiety and they continued their route as fast as their horses could carry them but without adding another word				485.896007706365
sir we don t keep any was the reply of the people who opened the doors but please ask at the hay dealer s where is the hay dealer s at the last large door in the street are there any other people in saint germain who sell straw yes there s the landlord of the lamb and gros louis the farmer they both live in the rue des ursulines very well d artagnan went instantly to the hay dealer and bargained with him for a hundred and fifty trusses of straw which he obtained at the rate of three pistoles each				9230.566728520143
athos seemed to grow calm as the critical moment approached				2311.9635645674357
at this moment two women entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose				1461.8519553824804
the devil said porthos				11.546416529097243

and will you sign the contract i see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus far well since you will grant me no more i must be content with what you give me				68.57366790748881

we will therefore leave the two friends who had nothing important to say to each other and follow aramis				202.43495109975353
you are madame bonacieux the young woman drew back filled with surprise and terror				1175.352685878051
with this sum he could manage to keep out of difficulties				9138.370355481758
you unraveled it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all and while we are still gaping with wonder at the news you come and tell us today let us say no more about it well then let us talk about it since you desire it replied aramis patiently				19419.314401716336
may i not drink to your health and you to mine said d artagnan filling two glasses with the beaugency wine which he had obtained from the liberality of m bonacieux				2689.2444824233608
at the same moment and in the midst of the terrifying silence which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the door				186.21395084404003
yet on his arrival morrel did not utter a complaint or say one harsh word				464.9578668709931
at these words a visible emotion was expressed on the beautiful countenance and calm features of athos				159.86098290072957
what is it to me who have passed twenty years between life and death				684.6389119347048

oh as i told you before i think the old fellow is very close come you do not flatter him i scarcely know him i think i have seen him three times in my life all i know relating to him is through busoni and himself				180.71304406879435
the men of my crew who are devoted to me for life and death mount guard around this apartment and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard				6620.277526574465
but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken				122439.00552366742
tomorrow for instance he is going to spend the day and night there are you sure of it he has invited me to dine there there s a life for you said caderousse a town house and a country house that is what it is to be rich and shall you dine there probably when you dine there do you sleep there if i like i am at home there caderousse looked at the young man as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart				390.2770831526996
unfortunately he was in a bad vein he lost all together with twenty five pistoles for which he had given his word				485.95555652583425
a real father yes so long as he pays me you ll honor and believe him that s right				877.9702297391326
all the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement				304992.4255653892
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel				183660.96370044054
perhaps you have done your duty as a soldier but as a gentleman i say that you are very culpable d artagnan was chewing the stalk of a flower unable to reply and thoroughly uncomfortable for when turned from the eyes of athos he encountered those of aramis				185.95308017467636
but i doubt that your object was like theirs to rescue the holy sepulchre you are quite right beauchamp observed the young aristocrat				134867.48171241
but as if to contradict his statement at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his hand				188.05121822603326
well said beauchamp let them now say that drama is unnatural ma foi said château renaud i would rather end my career like m de morcerf a pistol shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe and moreover it kills said beauchamp				512.2871986714173
nay it must have been a promise a country clown said anne of austria people will laugh let them answered d artagnan				76.96860545430691
there said monte cristo placing his arms around the count and leaning with him over the front of the box just as haydée whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale features close to morcerf s face				648.6161658985635
her majesty did us the honor to ask our aid for her husband				868.6829932696305

oh the devil				532.6870344948989
he appeared just at that moment of stupor which follows great catastrophes				151157.96634814452
but as we have said it was at least a league from the château d if to this island				183119.31593228952

one was a young man of three or four and twenty who was in love with m morrel s daughter and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce him to withdraw the other was an old one eyed cashier called cocles or cock eye a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee hive and which had so completely replaced his real name that he would not in all probability have replied to anyone who addressed him by it				93.4997814459948
impostor indeed m				539.2263265477166

and you grimaud he said to his companion who had just come in after his round with d artagnan are you thirsty as thirsty as a scotchman was grimaud s laconic reply				1042.3311095310921
the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude				119496.45043158128
but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber				547.2312968141301
let us get ready gentlemen but this second letter said athos you forget that it appears to me however that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened				1119.6575730223137

only warn him that it is you why should i do that because monsieur some mischief might happen to you of what kind in the name of wonder monsieur porthos may imagine you belong to the house and in a fit of passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains what have you done to him then we have asked him for money the devil				539.6980966592898
that will keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon you heard our repast announced will you now take the trouble to enter the dining room your humble servant going first to show the way at these words moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his guest				9226.72063893635

i am glad to see said d artagnan that you have still that honest lad with you he is my steward replied porthos he will never leave me				65.22666555590237
madame said d artagnan rising i have only one thing more to wish which is that the next thing you ask from me shall be my life and with this conclusion a way peculiar to himself he rose and left the room				188.8260328215364
you were you know how i settled the matter did he die i don t know				947.0054640068893
yes monsieur afraid of being heard				707.4280803036842
the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the pavement and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor				75142.84256642974
he has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would				25601.393666712367
on receiving the warning letter you wrote to me i had this woman arrested and gave her in charge to a loyal servant				1552.812595045686
porthos chapter xxvi				16705.919080778775
i am only a lieutenant of musketeers very poor and journeys cost money				1054.8672372615324
de chavigny who according to report was a son of richelieu s and had been a creature of the late cardinal s understood tyranny				167248.8148975263
what do you mean				8464.081058922302
is the committee willing to hear this witness yes yes they all said at once				929.4223417983749
edward endured the accident with miraculous courage he did not utter a single cry but fell lifeless into my arms nor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over				1391.3124330626515
nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains				214975.9008705182
escape had never once occurred to him				34.335531941228574
you told me yourself that that ring that ring i have				4316.858108048583
at that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all				162.01129170701697
yes i passed the evening at the cardinal rospigliosi s and there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men for andrea rondolo asked franz				795.0278547717347
well sir said madame de saint méran after a few minutes reflection i must hasten the marriage for i have but a short time to live you madame you dear mamma exclaimed m de villefort and valentine at the same time				698.0290276450853
each man had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their crime though still pale with fear they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold				1960.5948264917863
i can not account for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the danglars ah said the count in a somewhat forced tone that may be easily explained the comtesse de morcerf who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with one of ignoble birth that is natural enough i do not know if that is her reason said albert but one thing i do know that if this marriage be consummated it will render her quite miserable				129181.95136075851
the world is not wanting in attractions				90627.29599277259
there is the little door opening into the garden				2311.784977783195
at this instant a second cry less piercing than the first but followed by prolonged groaning was heard				731.01450895737
to undermine the ground for fifty feet to devote three years to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the sea to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred feet at the risk of being dashed to pieces against the rocks should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that dantès had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to death				683.1179884265457
it was the last yearning for life contending with the resolution of despair then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate				153723.25829039593
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth				24295.334793120746
is she not free to love whomsoever she will oh if you take it in that sense said caderousse it is another thing				1583.3228069288398
villefort and franz returned to the faubourg saint honoré				6649.960918490223
oh pray do for heaven s sake tell us all about is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me and i can well understand said the countess shrugging up her beautiful shoulders as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins that those who have once seen that man will never be likely to forget him the sensation experienced by franz was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested person felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving				31124.0622127132
as they went from the hôtel des gardes they separated leaving the street at opposite ends one having to quit paris by the barrière de la villette and the other by the barrière montmartre to meet again beyond st denis a strategic maneuver which having been executed with equal punctuality was crowned with the most fortunate results				6395.723347495295
in the passage she saw a retreating shadow it was julie who uneasy herself had anticipated her mother				731.659308121328
ali bring me some water the count turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting				146115.09692669852
emmanuel tried to comfort the women but his eloquence faltered				28296.544026528016
occasionally he shuddered he thought of the moment when from the top of that wall he should protect the descent of his dear valentine pressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate hand				209.22206227350136
it was evident that the abbé limited himself to objects of strict necessity				38460.219355406545
monsieur cried dantès i can tell by your voice you are touched with pity tell me at least to hope i can not tell you that replied the inspector i can only promise to examine into your case oh i am free then i am saved who arrested you m				624.9604393402699
yes i see for the young man raoul said d artagnan				23.91258998757106
pass your arms around my neck and fear nothing but i shall make you lose your balance and we shall both be dashed to pieces don t be afraid				4386.1770823354955
he was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and trembling declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the day before near the palace				2170.5263021874325
sir he said you have made a mistake you have given me gold i know it the concierge looked upon the count with surprise				1992.3739333271533
the cardinal s enemy no the king s friend said aramis the king s friend you understand				702.9041961575399
he will amass wealth he will injure the king s revenue and pay to himself the pensions which richelieu paid to others				1123.621263340242
wait then said the duke fumbling in his pocket				1254.1070887769004
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the island of elba then said monte cristo you went to him monsieur i said my brother was assassinated yesterday in the streets of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your duty to find out				540.1558556133701
i will introduce you to him for it will be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your money full dress said the major half aloud				7742.2878800931185
read the address monsieur el comte de wardes the remembrance of the scene at st germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous gascon				1161.00153889729
but by what means				3613.614781376112
help help cried mademoiselle d armilly taking the bell from her companion s hand and ringing it yet more violently				6329.481223196913
all the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every word for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of words until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the pity of heaven				607.3150009225914
what joy for my lord and master du vallon de bracieux de pierrefonds thou good mousqueton				1384.2067345467328
how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat receding serpent like forehead round vulture shaped head and sharp hooked nose like the beak of a buzzard				93299.15428516429
oh succor him				30.523761022256775
and perhaps you look for it with as much impatience as i do perhaps this evening madame bonacieux will visit the conjugal domicile madame bonacieux is not at liberty this evening replied the husband seriously she is detained at the louvre this evening by her duties so much the worse for you my dear host so much the worse				3716.0836326432786
i think on the contrary that it is a charming night replied the countess and those who are here will complain of but one thing that of its too rapid flight i am not speaking said the duke with a smile of the persons who are here the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with you and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant persons who were out in the streets of rome ah asked the countess who is out in the streets of rome at this hour unless it be to go to a ball our friend albert de morcerf countess whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven o clock this evening said franz and whom i have not seen since and don t you know where he is not at all is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to franz you who know rome better than he does you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race today replied franz and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell				8429.040692639766
the return				1560.5397247675057
the old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression				1006.3588242945768
i will go straight to the louvre i will give in my resignation as captain of the king s musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal s guards and if he refuses me morbleu i will turn abbé at these words the murmur without became an explosion nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies				81915.78600619681
as porthos had foreseen the cavalcade produced a good effect and if mme				212.65854518788743
you are quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind oh my dear count exclaimed danglars i never for an instant entertained such a feeling towards you no you merely wished to be convinced nothing more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at rest we may as well fix a sum as the probable expenditure of the first year suppose we say six millions to six millions gasped danglars so be it then if i should require more continued monte cristo in a careless manner why of course i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a year and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the sum i mentioned				10146.209058931443
when madame de beauvais appeared at the door and announced the cardinal the child who had been absorbed in the pages of quintus curtius enlivened as they were by engravings of alexander s feats of arms frowned and looked at his mother				756.0265944046415
ah you fellows are good managers				284716.95676374633
today he said with an effort today the man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of noirtier s room where he had seen him the preceding night				906.4042834499013
a ground floor ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and another floor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye				3072.833728649911
he looked to see if the dish of beans was still there the dish of beans had disappeared				613.0339481766449
i am come to talk to you about a thousand things but first tell me were you going out or just returned i was going out sir then in order not to hinder you i will get up with you if you please in your carriage and tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow no said the count with an imperceptible smile of contempt for he had no wish to be seen in the young man s society no i prefer listening to you here my dear m andrea we can chat better in doors and there is no coachman to overhear our conversation the count returned to a small drawing room on the first floor sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also				1432.9962513649991
let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal and how he likes but the queen is sacred and if anyone speaks of her let it be respectfully porthos you are as vain as narcissus i plainly tell you so replied aramis				218.60795971909099
that woman had in all probability poisoned my brother and in order to inherit from me she was about to assassinate me in my turn				1130.3924672330074
do you know where i shall find him near blois				6393.180387906587
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee				6969.431526809169
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the abbé faria but it seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting edmond dantès				657.3950060582705
i would propose to you to stake planchet but as that has already been done the englishman would not perhaps be willing decidedly my dear athos said d artagnan i should like better not to risk anything that s a pity said athos coolly				8206.321300306196
d épinay can not leave the drawing room at present it is at this moment replied barrois with the same firmness that m noirtier my master wishes to speak on important subjects to m franz d épinay grandpapa noirtier can speak now then said edward with his habitual quickness				88734.58131941252
what time is it then eh				1965.167060203354
take in two reefs in the top sails cried the captain let go the bowlin s haul the brace lower the top gallant sails haul out the reef tackles on the yards that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker his firm sonorous and unexpected voice made everyone start				13589.563926701205
yes gentlemen in the king s room				181.55767501180253
he went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty				4007.1612664904546
two windows only of the pavilion faced the street three other windows looked into the court and two at the back into the garden				2380.4173055995134
you will find my will in the secretaire in my bedroom the young man remained standing and motionless having but the force of will and not the power of execution				2747.4249251396245
i am in your opinion a lara a manfred a lord ruthven then just as i am arriving at the climax you defeat your own end and seek to make an ordinary man of me				79.57712103477563
of the important cities given up by henry iv				1928.5417095027099
his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek				4580.137815475118
i can not resist doing so he must live zounds replied d artagnan why don t you give yourself up directly feet and hands bound to that wretch				3648.8750248757724
it is indeed a sum which might be regretted even by a philosopher				223167.8705928536
franz returned to the manuscript and continued sir said the president you have been invited to join this assembly you were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfolded you accepted				7274.413381764233
monsieur de beaufort or another				1004.6797244103003
the rochellais had at last taken possession of the bastion				2813.0543752973963
all the same i should like to do him that service what do you say to it i will tell the coadjutor said bazin				3837.6297661380554
planchet took the crossroad and by seven o clock in the morning he was at armentières				9017.704023823564
this young boarder of yours has she tried to fly no that is true but she that is another thing i believe she is detained in france by some love affair ah said milady with a sigh if she loves she is not altogether wretched then said the abbess looking at milady with increasing interest i behold another poor victim alas yes said milady				554.6585500484061
franz complimented albert who looked at himself in the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction				3538.149262435362
as for what you do me the honor to say i presume you mean i was afraid the queen smiled				460.2745056434934
comminges who was on guard that night at the palais royal ran in				912.9128094221556
the door immediately closed and d artagnan found himself again in complete obscurity				5390.898286767131
what am i				710.7524758860733
do not be alarmed m noirtier said d avrigny i am going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him this sort of attack is very frightful to witness and taking barrois under the arms he dragged him into an adjoining room but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade				97648.54344752435
the lower rooms were entirely filled with kourchid s troops that is to say with our enemies				1084.7690549602848
you said you were but three but it appears to me we are four but you are not one of us said porthos				198.74577983519382
we will charge upon you then said he if you disobey there are five of them said athos half aloud and we are but three we shall be beaten again and must die on the spot for on my part i declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered man athos porthos and aramis instantly drew near one another while jussac drew up his soldiers				2726.7814259049023
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port				5721.919214190887
my brother edward who inherits nothing from his mother will therefore be poor in comparison with me				87.31347757405656
you have some in the house have you not yes send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic villefort immediately despatched a messenger				7196.661031257748
it is in truth monsieur le coadjuteur s carriage said d artagnan upon my honor i begin to think that heaven favors us he mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk cord which was attached to the coachman s little finger				1869.3769663554604
in the name of heaven explain yourself oh				531.6359841870702
i paused but i had already drunk half a glass				997.9865350042357
p s be it well understood that the fifty louis which i send are equally for aramis as for you for you as aramis athos smiled and his fine eye was dimmed by a tear				5153.964952786256
d artagnan would have remonstrated at this but athos put his hand upon his shoulder with a smile and d artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince				1284.991454492648
la ramee then proposed to send some one to pick them up but the duke remarked that it would be losing time and going near the rampart himself and looking over he saw a man working in one of the numerous little gardens cleared out by the peasants on the opposite side of the moat				7622.938162824751
being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys a thousand pistoles to each of you if you will assist my escape but if you deliver me up to your masters i have near at hand avengers who will make you pay dearly for my death grimaud hesitated				3456.0233230849776
she who out of friendship for me wished to take me from my persecutors				30703.77599361074
when i am happy i wish all the world to be so but it appears that is not possible the young man departed laughing at the joke which he thought he alone could comprehend				3341.225139154772
never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me				51.3803699153371
if we can succeed in saving the king it will be good if we die for him it will be grand so you know beforehand you must perish said d artagnan				84.6852126907946
what the deuce can you expect				6291.494773032628
she held in her hand a fresh billet from milady				547.8338783554761
sitting alone in the front of a box immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a woman of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek costume which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire				3420.195797755654
you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square feet a young man who is not the worst lodged in paris can live				2072.757869212357
the of february at half past two in the afternoon today is the of july why it is but seventeen months only seventeen months replied dantès				646.0048913482726
but monsieur de tréville is a skilled physiognomist who knows men at first sight and he placed you in the company of his brother in law monsieur dessessart leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the musketeers monseigneur is correctly informed said d artagnan				73.47288927929681
hold see				853.0534546874521
on the other side the crimes the power and the infernal genius of milady had more than once terrified him				37.58399635724973
then noticing in the dim light the still youthful and veiled figure of madame de morcerf pardon me he added with a smile i leave you albert albert understood his thoughts				1095.5951399454882
what can you expect athos				21.98277242847549
i should not like to be groslow if he meets him well said athos to the man in english				1781.6867371159185
had i such a uniform as your eminence possesses i protest i should be mightily content and i would take an oath never to wear any other costume yes but for to night s adventure i don t suppose my dress would have been a very safe one				764.9872748643405
come you are no longer twenty years old to my great regret mordieu				36481.56625650938
sir said he i am chief clerk of the house of thomson french of rome				939.0906863754099
but passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and bertuccio entered				791.6376202186813
that letter is not lost cried he				10.037940133833713
i did not lose sight of him for an instant				1201.3610066480594
this was not enough he must now learn to write				1951.8424000445768
you must die athos pale as a ghost repeated these words to the man who seeing the bodeful preparations that were making put himself in an attitude of defense				93496.89248866125
coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st magloire for she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there but she was fascinated by the lofty airs of porthos				199.82004047234707
but he has discovered a thousand means of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him				35.480663089543754
enough asked m de tréville				1021.345263561284
silence purveyor of gossip do not spread that report				6391.186975843911
no quarter cried a voice in french answering to that of winter which made them tremble				949.8419341372133
on his part the king returned to his apartment				607.1705125239558
caderousse was like fernand enrolled in the army but being married and eight years older he was merely sent to the frontier				13256.455921196382
aramis mumbled verses to himself and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his mustache in sign of despair				1130.2852087087863
through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the subject of their parley				156584.99736401072
with folded arms he gazed for some time upon the great city				1024.3614113920726
now and then a jolt more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same country thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race				10012.339895321777
the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage but d artagnan whose anger already excited was much increased by recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and had been very near winning his diamond of athos caught at his bridle and stopped him				31.439994044036595
where are we going asked he by a gesture				3195.9180629716507
he drew up for a minute threw a rapid glance around him and then his hand fell instantly into his pocket where it began playing with a pistol				4250.434034404797
the minister knew of their departure and had planted people on the road to prevent them ever reaching their destination				9215.605041765692
god is always the last resource				155469.30655995998
this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an opening through which a child could not have passed was for better security furnished with three iron bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a prisoner s escape				4287.080990960245
you see my poor friend that i am sometimes bereft of my ordinary thoughtfulness perhaps i am wrong in speaking thus to you who have evidently a leaning to mazarin i cried d artagnan not in the least you spoke of a mission did i				1150.0664438489862
the nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question				614.409673457672
she lived in a small town with her brother who was a curate				3964.674899643197
come my friend he said thrusting his hand through the opening where are we going dentro la testa answered a solemn and imperious voice accompanied by a menacing gesture				3378.9472683514464

our young men had been waiting about half an hour amid a crowd of courtiers when all the doors were thrown open and his majesty was announced				3385.698519063012
noirtier seeing barrois in this pitiable condition showed by his looks all the various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man				142.73434620525325
sire replied the courtier laughing in order that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly right in relying on the good feeling of france but i fear i am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt by whom by bonaparte or at least by his adherents my dear blacas said the king you with your alarms prevent me from working and you sire prevent me from sleeping with your security wait my dear sir wait a moment for i have such a delightful note on the pastor quum traheret wait and i will listen to you afterwards there was a brief pause during which louis xviii				1628.8459253692756

you are much pleased with yourself said he to raoul when they were alone are you not well yes replied raoul				608.5760263686142
franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals				121845.86962326223
going along d artagnan shaking his head said i know that my going to athos is useless and absurd but still i owe this courtesy to my old friend a man who had in him material for the most noble and generous of characters oh monsieur athos was a noble gentleman said planchet was he not				686.0336674292013
the host called the stable boy and ordered him to saddle le blanc then he awoke his son a child of seven years whom he ordered to ride before the gentleman and bring back the horse				904.8272361405093
wait here for me and looking attentively around him to see if he had left any of his keys in his closets mazarin went out				527.880722430722
one thing however reassured him he remembered that before they were buried their heads were generally cut off and he felt that his head was still on his shoulders				881.7062239052746
felton would see all perhaps he would say nothing but he would see				890.991629937146
what people are you leading thus into the bowels of the earth my fifty recruits from the chevalier d humieres who are destined to enter the light cavalry and who have only received as yet for their equipment their white cloaks and where are you going to the house of one of my friends a sculptor only we enter by the trap through which he lets down his marble very good said gondy shaking rochefort by the hand who descended in his turn and closed the trap after him				36.07654079529831

so much the better				832.8213749597867
de winter remembered the monster that milady had been he rose dignified and calm restraining by the severity of his look the wild glance of the young man				142.38012039781714
felton cried she				150.91358984732025

don t suppose that you are the only person who can serve me monsieur de rochefort				665.3297380357486
it was then albert returning from his meeting with the count perceived his father watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside				3531.4711990576443
the war with spain being ended fernand s career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout europe				2459.587162093133
be not alarmed at what i say i want to be convinced				4573.224190396859
fairfax answered a laughing voice the silvery tone of which betrayed it as that of a woman is not such a fool as to be here a loud laugh followed these words pronounced with that boldness which women draw from their own weakness a weakness which removes them beyond the power of vengeance				2833.13895887226
d artagnan did the same				1264.9844556566034
but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than others i never rest till i have torn the disguises from my fellow creatures and found out their weaknesses				35037.16849123744
that is to say when you have received my instructions				6071.829814893836
little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an instant like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker half an hour after the night was quite dark				7046.845508266031
compelled as they were to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious moment should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls through which they had worked their way				935.4495911104347
do you promise i swear to you i will it is well				484.0933109933545
he offered his arm to the countess she took it or rather just touched it with her little hand and they together descended the steps lined with rhododendrons and camellias				86082.45984322055
i was sure of it the cursed letter don t be afraid you idiot there is nothing in hand but a party of pleasure ah like the charming journey the other day when it rained bullets and produced a crop of steel traps well if you are really afraid monsieur planchet resumed d artagnan i will go without you				64.70357752243663
he s a fine looking fellow said another if he had only a comb and hair grease he d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids his coat looks nearly new and his boots are brilliant				464396.6610611669
such songs disturb the mind and yet we become accustomed to them her voice is so beautiful chapter liv				31582.945146813327
but why have two of each sort asked danglars				264.4943325981629
i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded francs				1411.0730367145632
he rose on the entrance of the coadjutor and at that moment ten o clock struck				2074.6692652588395

nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states				2319.46230227889
to be sure for monsieur de wardes now there is one said kitty who appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor monsieur d artagnan go to bed mademoiselle said milady i don t like comments d artagnan heard the door close then the noise of two bolts by which milady fastened herself in				871.9573472715078
oh the wretched hours i have endured the torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly poison poured into your glass and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find time to throw it away sir said valentine at the height of her terror you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass but if you saw this you must also have seen the person who poured it yes valentine raised herself in bed and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of terror				1198.395572569098
the arts change about and make a tour of the world things take a different name and the vulgar do not follow them that is all but there is always the same result				9588.47217816304

chapter lvii				7345.352239501911
in short up to this period nothing had been wanting to tréville but opportunity but he was ever on the watch for it and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand				192.17284376480555
the name was not wholly forgotten but mixed up and confused with ancient recollections				35914.875944153406
but you come from england				926.0364009003608
au revoir albert				315.6087299797909
andrea was gone				3509.169135444061
you who have chateau meadows mountains woods you who have forty thousand francs a year you are not happy my dear friend all those things i have but i am a hermit in the midst of superfluity surrounded i suppose only by clodhoppers with whom you could not associate porthos turned rather pale and drank off a large glass of wine				2006.4191665035662
they proceeded to the rue saint denis				4458.471118684952
but he must be disturbed cried the host here are two english gentlemen just arrived well well the english like good wine as you may know monsieur these have asked for the best				3477.768719103493
i struggled then with all my strength and doubtless opposed weak as i was a long resistance for i heard him cry out these miserable puritans				3299.7109626906977
the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated i should hesitate i therefore repeat to you i speak not to a magistrate but to a friend				584.8442193260269
i have heard said blaisois that port is a very good wine excellent exclaimed mousqueton smacking his lips				406.5975778493586
but you madame so beautiful in reality you so pure in appearance must have committed great iniquities for lord de winter to pursue you thus they have eyes repeated milady with an accent of indescribable grief but they see not ears have they but they hear not but cried the young officer speak then speak confide my shame to you cried milady with the blush of modesty upon her countenance for often the crime of one becomes the shame of another confide my shame to you a man and i a woman				410.9242024927384
he rode up a very quiet street looking to the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his beautiful englishwoman when from the ground floor of a pretty house which according to the fashion of the time had no window toward the street he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted				2679.365635748064
franz had by degrees become accustomed to the count s pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting				6780.932105406851
in less than one week from this time i will ascertain who this m de monte cristo is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our presence of children that have been disinterred in a garden villefort pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count shudder had he heard him				36.87829255425287
our expedition made a favorable beginning				16582.33188671733
de sévigné				132890.44043259762
no one who knew the count could mistake his expression when on entering he said ali bring me my pistols with the ivory cross ali brought the box to his master who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a little powder and shot				44566.496816610226
i told you the day before yesterday to bring them with you why have you not done so they are below sire and with your permission la chesnaye will bid them come up yes yes let them come up immediately				1127.3188884278593
the coachman stooped down for his orders				5213.132069438703
what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed no not i replied franz but our neighbor the count of monte cristo oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it				74.9033657305638
it was noon and monte cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the apartments of haydée as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive full and perfect happiness in the same manner as ordinary natures demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations				11018.081094979394
yes yes said caderousse but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy and why because mercédès is a very fine girl and fine girls never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens really answered edmond with a smile which had in it traces of slight uneasiness				1653.556384443454
buckingham tried to smile a last time but death checked his thought which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love				943.2279801533095
the chancellor made a profound reverence				34523.98175489018
my dear fellow don t speak like that of monsieur groslow				2588.723296252844
you arrive in good time monsieur said the king who when his passions were raised to a certain point could not dissemble i have learned some fine things concerning your musketeers and i said tréville coldly i have some pretty things to tell your majesty concerning these gownsmen what said the king with hauteur				164934.1940456012
now this was a sunday and the abbé had come to ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him				36.48212812370143
when her hands were loosed he took some sea water and sprinkled it over her face				625.7882472070529
come come continued d arminges to dinner for like most men of his age and generation he did not allow sentiment or sensibility to interfere with a repast				46874.22708254009
determined to put the advice of m de tréville in practice instantly d artagnan directed his course toward the rue des fossoyeurs in order to superintend the packing of his valise				37784.194100899855
my mother replied the young princess a cavalier has just entered the louvre and wishes to present his respects to your majesty he arrives from the army and has he says a letter to remit to you on the part of the marechal de grammont i think ah said the queen to de winter he is one of my faithful adherents but do you not observe my dear lord that we are so poorly served that it is left to my daughter to fill the office of doorkeeper madame have pity on me exclaimed de winter you wring my heart and who is this cavalier henrietta asked the queen				407.9986425645984
both raoul went out and when athos heard his young joyous voice calling to grimaud and olivain he sighed				5419.522882627744
these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been				5873.956413012215
what can they have said and she again tried to think what it could be				826.7446810482505
adieu or rather au revoir the mendicant continued to rip his garments and drew from amid his rags a hundred and fifty spanish double pistoles which he laid down on the table then he opened the door bowed and went out before the young man stupefied by his letter had ventured to address a word to him				35.281257346728154
he wills that human vengeance should precede celestial justice men fear him and spare him i said felton i do not fear him nor will i spare him the soul of milady was bathed in an infernal joy				1058.5950017320768
i do not say i regret no i will never pronounce that sentence which would not be orthodox the jesuit raised his hands toward heaven and the curate did the same				1134.4769240352955
what are you doing asked the coadjutor				1280.0360692446388
villefort she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner				738.2625685652253
you have been in my service a year your fund has already begun to accumulate let it continue to do so this address delivered in the presence of ali who not understanding one word of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an effect on m baptistin only to be conceived by such as have occasion to study the character and disposition of french domestics				118659.05217017012
all at once he heard his bolts drawn and made a terrified bound				254808.10956654407
the queen had confidence in the courage of d artagnan which she knew and the cardinal in the strength of porthos which he had experienced				29503.35357303352
monte cristo took albert into his study and pointing to a seat placed another for himself				183.22245006765326
both were men of courage and honor and as m de la trémouille a protestant and seeing the king seldom was of no party he did not in general carry any bias into his social relations				167519.54730916137
but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass she but who is she oh i remember said mme				184.35322503635658
mercédès who will detest you if you have only the misfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved edmond true said fernand				2235.4605511651494
no one had the slightest suspicion and when next day taking a fowling piece powder and shot dantès declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock his wish was construed into a love of sport or a desire for solitude				14290.747140557703
as i have said she was twice married once in france the second time in england she was young you say twenty five years old beautiful ravishingly blond yes abundance of hair falling over her shoulders yes eyes of an admirable expression when she chose				130871.96953384759
every one likes his own uniform best my lord myself excepted and again mazarin smiled for you perceive that i have left off mine and put on yours lord bless us				320.83728840675917
beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative				9252.238594680082
what is he doing there said the inspector				3248.9719512402235
come let us put aside all rancor and talk pleasantly there s nothing i wish more replied mazarin				324.9800791402496
as to d artagnan being at bottom a prudent youth instead of returning home went and dined with the gascon priest who at the time of the distress of the four friends had given them a breakfast of chocolate				94527.48952041342
you have saved my life and i thank you continued dantès				401.9815042927796
the boy undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an hour				1384.7678832839097
dantès stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first time and indeed since his captivity in the château d if he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed				9892.45614881052
d artagnan as we have said perceived a hole in that place and in this hole the steps of a winding staircase				2883.443758341964
as he had prophesied would be the case he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself				192.2932900851847
instead of lights at every window as is customary on days of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that moment obscured the moon s feeble light				1148.3156576889776
as to king charles the question must be viewed differently in receiving and aiding him france will censure the acts of the english nation and thus so essentially harm england and especially the well being of the government that such a proceeding will be equivalent to pronounced hostilities at this moment mazarin became very uneasy at the turn which the letter was taking and paused to glance under his eyes at the young man				130.16725369597407
d artagnan smiled				402.6458395098817
where is there any to be found i can show you answered the gascon				1142.96263722054
old age is selfish sir and mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m noirtier which she can not be when she becomes the baroness d épinay				3019.2276953753235
or rather at what he said and what was he saying he said this madame mazarin is a stumbling block				41750.28336050712
rely on me to procure you the other i will do my best ah m morrel exclaimed the young seaman with tears in his eyes and grasping the owner s hand m				574.1682314770769
hear the end				792.9478116176115
had he better deny everything or tell everything				824.2746315580143
the young man standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with children whose mothers are still young and handsome				10017.048418240807
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the money this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean				23480.36974517366
gentlemen thus d artagnan addressed the four musketeers i am ordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the prisoner and since there are no locks to the carriage i shall sit beside him				35.80724590004988
god be praised				154326.38587616239
how old is she inquired the vicomte de bragelonne				1443.6508219284458
his face was livid large drops rolled down his face and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms				137752.4904236592
i shall hide myself in your cabin				7297.273341361727
my friend				429.79023828699815
you wished it to be preceded by all these titles it is quite wonderful mr president how entirely you have read my thoughts said benedetto in his softest voice and most polite manner				740.2252816910175
hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded				6872.46763752842
he is alone said grimaud				354.36939949143044
now said the owner to his wife and daughter leave me i wish to speak with this gentleman and he glanced towards the clerk of thomson french who had remained motionless in the corner during this scene in which he had taken no part except the few words we have mentioned				9937.142716879545
oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth these words made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused				5719.813258740506
after having been for some time after the death of louis xiii				753.6625239832528
i have seen so many remarkable things in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do look upon him as one of byron s heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some manfred some lara some werner one of those wrecks as it were of some ancient family who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved one by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the laws of society you say i say that monte cristo is an island in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag				36792.28309366468
make your mind easy resumed athos we are all faithful servants of his majesty is what you tell me true asked the wounded man				123.04499086745136
are the english expected by land or do the musketeers consider themselves superior officers monseigneur replied athos for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him monseigneur the musketeers when they are not on duty or when their duty is over drink and play at dice and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys lackeys grumbled the cardinal				269.1031277818128
what you do not know				700.4817432047765
nothing is lost then and now madame till i see you again				240.179409748731
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change				7554.503962474888

but he will not avow it how so because they failed your honor gave me two of these frenchmen when they were only guilty of fighting for charles i				1150.4174698340676
morrel rushed forward to tear it from him but monte cristo perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his iron grasp				7943.090548623109
aramis shuddered				3110.1644378602336
under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her				164.19295164330953
it is nevertheless conclusive to my mind				653.9209353543305
the day after tomorrow he banishes me he transports me the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous				189912.8794656636
mazarin being thus placed beyond the pale of the protection of the law preparations on both sides were commenced by the queen to attack paris by the citizens to defend it				97.77563909460501
the baron came forward				895.339578797344
he must be apprehended do not attempt it he has revenged himself and has done well				497.9329509000271
do you recollect the words in which the information against you was formulated oh yes i read it over three times and the words sank deeply into my memory repeat it to me dantès paused a moment then said this is it word for word the king s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion that one edmond dantès mate on board the pharaon this day arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper again by the usurper with a letter for the bonapartist club in paris				496.1610624119308
they may hear us i don t understand it at all as you execute you will understand and yet i should have preferred you will have the pleasure of the surprise ah that is true hush porthos remained silent and motionless				1200.1174127977356
i retreated with the rest for eight and forty hours				1791.5836295928616
behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions				109916.0772760996
and so i did replied caderousse though once i confess i envied him his good fortune				1157.0047363837323
it is then buckingham cried felton in a high state of excitement				5668.529051509843

oh my god i have suffered enough surely				174172.99989891617
although athos was scarcely thirty years old and was of great personal beauty and intelligence of mind no one knew whether he had ever had a mistress				897.1456090327418
how many guns gentlemen twelve replied aramis				28.41002719695227
on the sixth day the smugglers returned				794.7261493702892
your eminence may perceive continued athos knitting his brow for this sort of investigation began to annoy him that we have not come out without our arms and he showed the cardinal with his finger the four muskets piled near the drum on which were the cards and dice				2392.7442066911344
planchet who had been the first to enter was the last to leave				2278.608847594337
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull note the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved and rustled in the wind				4960.387773366811
and how do you know there is a young woman whom i love and that i believed that woman dead asked d artagnan				71.1150448622609
mazarin went to the right hand and aramis could see the prisoner disappear at the turning of the avenue				31345.593547772827
charles shuddered				3009.2815288647585
oh cried porthos what s the matter now				1246.9610357387592
do you remember sir that duel with the englishman in the inclosure des carmes				120023.42363895626
come come madame cried d artagnan seizing her hands and surveying her with an ardent glance come be more generous				15777.059249923977
meanwhile time was passing on for the prisoner as well as for those who were preparing his escape only for him it passed more slowly				2582.284049739514
you the comte de la fere on the side of broussel blancmesnil and viole				175346.6430468047

i am on the earth to punish madame he added with a flaming glance any other woman were it the queen herself i would send to the executioner but to you i shall be merciful				19531.235410393183
send the case before the judges it is their business to judge and they shall judge only replied tréville it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live the purest life the most incontestable virtue can not exempt a man from infamy and persecution				47862.96435862321
although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger the queen when his death was announced to her would not believe the fact and even imprudently exclaimed it is false he has just written to me but the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence laporte detained in england as everyone else had been by the orders of charles i arrived and was the bearer of the duke s dying gift to the queen				379.2343002671209
dantès rose advanced a few steps and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down				643.5820975982602
it was the island of monte cristo				339.6404421993585
then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her flight absolutely monseigneur but she has most likely returned to the louvre at one o clock this morning she had not returned my god				614.7132688437786
all the corps rivaled one another in audacity and gaiety				208193.15183070916
they are only four a joyous smile lighted porthos s face				646.2975948196627
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the door again opened and danglars entered visibly agitated				5211.089129843454
has such and such a perfume done anything for me				58.14224086636969
under that pretense you run against me				74.84113737184613

fortunately dantès had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen years for his liberty and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth				37653.832954963655
he reached the rue saint honore and went up it toward the rue de la ferronnerie there the aspect changed here it was the tradesmen who were running from shop to shop their doors seemed closed like their shutters but they were only pushed to in such a manner as to open and allow the men who seemed fearful of showing what they carried to enter closing immediately				1218.9118875478473
you also stand aside he said to the masked man				126.44338211612637
keep up the dance then since he will have it so				425.0849405591593
he looked again through his glass but even then he could not distinguish anything				2441.4172180584
this commissary was a man of very repulsive mien with a pointed nose with yellow and salient cheek bones with eyes small but keen and penetrating and an expression of countenance resembling at once the polecat and the fox				101761.28613455972
then why did you smile why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself valentine do you want me to go away ah no no				918.7133926670512
de guitaut mme				117.04896080391826
but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel son				907.5810826253204
thanks father thanks and feeling in his pocket he took thence a small pocket book which contained ten bank notes each of francs				1473.5014773787286
yes in so many words and it must be so for the abbé knows correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe be it half a million then but on my word of honor i had no idea that it was so much because you are robbed by your steward				3365.382422181578
you ask what i have against you i tell you				31.615835040074664
we must inform the queen ah my faith yes said porthos and d artagnan at the same time we are coming nearer to it now inform the queen said athos and how				1277.4379283004837
ma foi he said i prefer waiting till tomorrow				1755.909483082583
the piercing eye of peppino had noticed all				158.67019045200936
when it arrived there four guards and a police officer who accompanied it mounted into the heavy machine and closed the shutters then through an opening cautiously made the policeman began to watch the length of the rue cocatrix as if he was waiting for some one				798.7220096142806
i have begun a poem in verses of one syllable				26066.35716854509
her temper was uncertain but she came at last to accustom herself to my little ways and understand my little wishes so you are free now and rich alas groaned porthos i am a widower and have forty thousand francs a year				1440.2356528267192
but that is not all continued danglars he has opened an account with my house for his son may i ask how much he allows the young man five thousand francs per month sixty thousand francs per year				1441.8421880931573
he is walking about and thinking thought d artagnan but of what				566.4008612734629
but for the honor of the king of the queen well let us hope he will do something for the sake of their honor said the queen				381.84652784463054
approach and look at him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to run away no certainly replied planchet rather astonished at the unexpected honor conferred upon him				33.12578857033857
his proper vocation had always been the sword and he was delighted whenever he could draw it from the scabbard no matter for whom or against whom				12820.775888487777
on his part the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect				1266.6304290571582
the king don carlos has not left bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace				29431.467892574943
she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her heart and still she doubted the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her death				691.0724900517092
then monsieur de beaufort who was so familiar with the interior of the palais royal though he did not know the relations existing between the queen and the cardinal pictured to himself in his prison all that dramatic excitement which would ensue when the rumor should run from the minister s cabinet to the chamber of anne of austria monsieur de beaufort has escaped whilst saying that to himself monsieur de beaufort smiled pleasantly and imagined himself already outside breathing the air of the plains and the forests pressing a strong horse between his knees and crying out in a loud voice i am free it is true that on coming to himself he found that he was still within four walls he saw la ramee twirling his thumbs ten feet from him and his guards laughing and drinking in the ante chamber				541.0193925222541
she saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes				95861.08979736835
the journey chapter				237.74939469665108
there was a dispute among the guards				2066.764193046717
twenty witnesses added he could attest the fact and he named several distinguished gentlemen and among them was m le duc de la trémouille				10355.52525627015
her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor her beauty serves as a bait to her victims her body even pays what she promises i must do her that justice				1445.2046571612595
the sergeant of this company a veteran of the spanish wars had recognized porthos his old companion and very soon all those who served under him were placed in possession of startling facts concerning the honor of the ancient musketeers of tréville				1653.3072444419781
he likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty little mme				158.23936398683085
the citizen followed him				37.33366469032998
villefort ran to her and seized her hand which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper				107284.61218195017
he took back the ring but put it in his pocket and not on his finger				1853.4457090347908
m de la trémouille approached him and made him inhale some salts which recalled him to life				550.9828491758103
i forget				131727.19890167532
well over that coach house are the servants rooms with bells corresponding with the different apartments ah diable bells did you say what do you mean oh nothing				760.4766936091198
our athos who was as virtuous as scipio				195588.13300842
yes you have a recipe for it an infallible one that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely anything to drink yes said monte cristo but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed may we inquire what is this recipe asked debray				403.94274806655244
i wish to kill you be at rest as to that but to kill you quietly in a snug remote place where you will not be able to boast of your death to anybody i agree monsieur but do not be too confident				28428.188646598865
by dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death and if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be invented he began to reflect on suicide				2883.9525284789374
i remarked that he regretted the horse furniture very much				1447.4067165093472
your majesty is bored				85933.09525395554
i am incredulous the queen untied from around her throat a small golden key which hung there and presented it to the cardinal				294.8453431185099
nature subdued must yield in the combat the dream must succeed to reality and then the dream reigns supreme then the dream becomes life and life becomes the dream				1441.4860946762565
he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out				518.9052906106848
indeed said albert it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his country better than prince cavalcanti does				1750.2593978829889
in fact four men such as they were four men devoted to one another from their purses to their lives four men always supporting one another never yielding executing singly or together the resolutions formed in common four arms threatening the four cardinal points or turning toward a single point must inevitably either subterraneously in open day by mining in the trench by cunning or by force open themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain however well it might be defended or however distant it may seem				122925.72080359844
yes yes he said i will pardon you if you tell me all oh cried the executioner all				154.80521722231404
what are you doing asked milady with surprise				1919.771253207376
ten minutes passed thus and he was convinced that no one was watching him				33.358966704856385
let us act in freedom that we may act well and quickly i shall go he said to the queen well then answered aramis pray tell me a day or two beforehand that i may take that opportunity of going to paris to whom zounds				8728.388617859111
and he caused himself to be announced to the minister				1764.5261020847106
you have indeed a noble nature edmond and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment				545.4683601831314
near paris is it not very near only half a league from the barriers it is at auteuil at auteuil said villefort true madame de villefort told me you lived at auteuil since it was to your house that she was taken				1866.4928778029296

and you porthos i agree to it too said porthos if d artagnan approves of it				89.32415108313093
has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice				705.3350265996031
he has two means of extricating me from this dilemma the one by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the other by buying off my judges with gold				1959.748004099019
do you know that i die to morrow at ten o clock something your majesty will happen between now and then to make the execution impossible the king looked at aramis with astonishment				2265.717970953055
who goes there cried he as soon as he perceived the horsemen				2464.4192400362967
yes said morrel it is true i have but now left a house where death has just entered to run to you are you then come from m de morcerf s asked monte cristo				320.0708218967759
dantès perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father responded by a look of grateful pleasure while mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to edmond				1494.226322759533
approach and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known sire it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world really impossible				1284.479312899408
at the other end of the room under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard				6624.363678931607
listen my dear girl said d artagnan you can not but perceive that all this must end some way or other				391.37325173174634
porthos had his fits				141016.64137614693
i must own said aramis i am like the comte de la fere i can see nothing remarkable about it my lord said athos in a position so precarious as ours we must examine the earth and not the heavens				3747.490824780102
he invited me to a hunting party on his property in the month of september				7946.492506460558
madame danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by monte cristo around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the house then repressing a slight emotion which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her color she ascended the steps saying to morrel sir if you were a friend of mine i should ask you if you would sell your horse morrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace and then turned round to monte cristo as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment				23606.89184777498
all that edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss grown rock				2484.8282756758276
you will live my lord you will live repeated the faithful servant of anne of austria on his knees before the duke s sofa				24249.6174334333
and his name said he				8.087197063613075
the ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage and everyone reconducted his lady to her place but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady to advance eagerly toward the queen				387.6822282245179
mazarin disappeared as they rose from table				684.6114897369516
you have the window that is sufficient				6830.421179857314
as long as your brother was with me he kept me up but he is gone and can no longer send us news of himself either to me or to your father				896.6084626917176
for life replied porthos in the same manner				765.8292723490907
i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat said planchet and if i am taken i will swallow it well but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission said d artagnan				66.63247338779948
the most profound terror reigned throughout the house				526.7467159509829

i was forced then to combat the fast of the evening with the nourishment of the morning				408.2578640302417
adieu madame				550.1868301256715
every one withdrew				2717.831056725351
then he looked anxiously at valentine				621.9510103393316
the moon which had shone for a short time disappeared behind the clouds every object was again plunged in the obscurity that is so awful in the deserts and still more so in that liquid desert the ocean and nothing was heard save the whistling of the west wind driving along the tops of the crested billows				132005.75203903083
cavalcanti s asked beauchamp				486.8136834652118

poor madame du vallon				4606.240587987242
had fernand really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from mercédès				1670.8682978243844
good bye said château renaud in his turn keeping his little cane in his left hand and saluting with his right				886.7003110579437
what are my commands said the queen				406.2838059112858
i shall not find amongst them such great hearts as yours				2723.395129090301
why didn t they search more vigilantly				129084.04646000157

pay him booby cried the stranger to his servant without checking the speed of his horse and the man after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host galloped after his master				1350.1520929759192
i address myself therefore first to the benevolence of your majesty that i may know what has become of my friends reserving to myself if necessary the right of appealing hereafter to your justice sir replied anne with a degree of haughtiness which to certain persons became impertinence this is the reason that you trouble me in the midst of so many absorbing concerns				20252.968066828944
on one of those immense staircases upon whose space modern civilization would build a whole house ascended and descended the office seekers of paris who ran after any sort of favor gentlemen from the provinces anxious to be enrolled and servants in all sorts of liveries bringing and carrying messages between their masters and m de tréville				1633.6833560209905

the officer leaned forward looked at her in his turn and appeared surprised to see that face just before so beautiful distorted with passion and almost hideous				123000.0677966741
suddenly he rallied made a violent effort to restrain himself and then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance				709.6779174424679
sensible i always obey madame when i am commanded by so gentle a voice he kissed her hand tenderly				3163.9846538466936
but the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without replying a word				467.19762941868095
mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice from behind the trees				3096.11921275425
in the course of the forenoon monsieur de beaufort had a game of tennis with la ramee a sign from grimaud put him on the alert				21263.037048217055

he thought that beginning to be afraid they had stayed behind and he continued to advance				3558.5240146701663
now the deliverance of the cardinal would be the ruin of our hopes and our hopes are thus far the only recompense we have for labors in comparison with which those of hercules were pygmean he went to find aramis				193.26925864562347
vampa without saying a word hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto drew it away made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there in a retreat unknown to everyone closed the stone upon him and then went and resumed his seat by teresa				5480.259317778455
the balls might be heard peppering the facade of the palais royal and one of them passing under d artagnan s arm entered and broke a mirror in which porthos was complacently admiring himself				187.74336502816925

i wore a long sword which cut like a damascus you remember it aramis for you always called it balizarde				184920.75960666963
beside him glided caderousse whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the dantès father and son although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream				1434.7753166551493
a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little distance				2214.0475520804466
besides it came into the young man s mind that by remaining in the environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed he would perhaps have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair				1303.3625609049711

i spoke to benedetto alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the imagination of a child of twelve				6056.03640367699

i have written a letter today that letter is not yet gone				3892.4097362536813
though mordaunt had been so completely taken by surprise and had mounted the stairs in such utter confusion when once seated he recovered himself as it were and prepared to seize any possible opportunity of escape				4307.93372317128
weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the chamber above me and the next instant a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the staircase				2767.314064075882
thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the window his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of conversation for the moment a conversation which assumed as in the case of the interviews with danglars and morcerf a turn analogous to the persons if not to the situation				1611.1264218064944
help me out of paris help me out of france i can not take you however to the siege of la rochelle said d artagnan				68.06783358980307

sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self love immensely piqued to think that albert de morcerf the most admired and most sought after of any young person of his day should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains				18396.343268068733
the devil but sir said planchet with a look of shrewdness i know where bazin is where is he at notre dame what has he to do at notre dame he is beadle bazin beadle at notre dame				2277.005700374861

they were willing and ready to retrace their steps when in crossing the suburb which leads to the gates of the town upon a white wall which was at the corner of a street turning around the rampart athos cast his eyes upon a drawing in black chalk which represented with the awkwardness of a first attempt two cavaliers riding furiously one of them carried a roll of paper on which were written these words they are following us oh exclaimed athos here it is as clear as day pursued as he was d artagnan would not have tarried here five minutes had he been pressed very closely which gives us hopes that he may have succeeded in escaping aramis shook his head				376.5347145376944
good evening comrade said d artagnan in his most fascinating voice and manner				769.573046858423
athos and aramis did not proceed a hundred steps without being stopped by sentinels placed before the barricades who demanded the watchword and on their saying that they were going to monsieur de bouillon on a mission of importance a guide was given them under pretext of conducting them but in fact as a spy over their movements				27097.589385697847

i know too well the wisdom of the queen and that of her advisers to suppose that they will leave the capital long in trouble that may lead to a revolution thus then it is your opinion said anne of austria with a sneer and biting her lips with rage that yesterday s riot which to day is already a rebellion to morrow may become a revolution yes madame replied the coadjutor gravely				2367.158144073504

the shipowner smiling followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five o clock in the morning until nine o clock at night swarms in the famous street of la canebière a street of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles on turning round the owner saw danglars behind him apparently awaiting orders but in reality also watching the young sailor but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of edmond dantès				632.6026203177386
the people were in an excited mood but like a swarm of frightened bees seemed not to know at what point to concentrate and it was very evident that if leaders of the people were not provided all this agitation would pass off in idle buzzing				143011.84190953508

he had learned that dantès had been taken to prison and he had gone to all his friends and the influential persons of the city but the report was already in circulation that dantès was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne as impossible he met with nothing but refusal and had returned home in despair declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more could be done				1467.8233297341972

the first thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place but his eyes expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his features				5177.068889909846
well now listen we are listening it appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him				37.049023066312905
but dantès was so honorable and true in his own nature that he believed everybody s professions of friendship				10777.936273213214
mordaunt remained standing near the door				209.48141197418533

an adventure on the high road				1178.8354393122436
all this will not advance your outfit said athos for if i am not mistaken you have left the best of your apparel with milady and she will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you				50.4784954478167
i bought it from him but it belongs to d artagnan				65.75254016406438

lord de winter placed him in the hands of the guards who led him while awaiting further orders to a little terrace commanding the sea and then the baron hastened to the duke s chamber				548.0839301696886
now said d artagnan i am going to call this soldier and talk to him				29.8852584876468

these gentlemen added he pointing to the bodies can not hear us but we could throw them into the ditch said porthos after having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets yes said athos that s grimaud s business well then cried d artagnan pray let grimaud search them and throw them over the walls heaven forfend said athos they may serve us these bodies serve us said porthos				210.19462874109826

the smugglers left with edmond what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several times and each time making signs of a cordial farewell to which edmond replied with his hand only as if he could not move the rest of his body				338.5861471838031

athos cast a glance over the epistle and to disperse all the suspicions that might have been created read aloud my cousin my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams and even entertain great fear of them but of yours it may be said i hope every dream is an illusion				151891.6183369821
this morning i ventured to run along the gutters and well interrupted d artagnan i am delighted that de rochefort is free but as for thee if thou shouldst fall into the hands of the king s servants they will hang thee without mercy				154655.08756645696

he told me to watch you and why so				300.97219906097223
yes speak then i will presume to say that all my friends are in the king s musketeers and guards and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your eminence i should therefore be ill received here and ill regarded there if i accepted what monseigneur offers me do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that i have not yet made you an offer equal to your value asked the cardinal with a smile of disdain				10527.231523881315

very well very well said the workman aloud in excellent english				1776.3280500925969
if the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further we shall find her or rather she will find us tomorrow then she will give me some sign or other and i shall know what i have to do on my word said franz you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind albert was right the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young men made several more turns they did not again see the calash which had turned up one of the neighboring streets				2948.6995738640144
all four came up together				606.155720217058
if i wished to surprise him it was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him				33.04710158577633
my faith said aramis i must confess i feel a great repugnance to fire on these poor devils of civilians he is a bad priest said porthos who has pity for heretics in truth said athos aramis is right				891.7256617547644
well then off to the nearest goldsmith s and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him				31.940698630964192
the fortune is not her gift but is inherited from my relations certainly and that is why m and madame de saint méran have died that is why m noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir that is why you in your turn are to die it is because your father would inherit your property and your brother his only son succeed to his edward				5264.135324285581

the officer followed her				187.59472617488208
athos who heard milady s voice came sharply up				1267.568751874993
in that case i will forgive him and the musketeer rose grumbling took his sword hat pistols and cloak and followed the officer whilst porthos alone and sole possessor of the bed endeavored to follow the good example of falling asleep which his predecessor had set him				32.6392902992037
you meddle with politics do you and still more with cardinalist politics				3232.517552139056
it is you who are not a woman muttered mazarin				299.38767671990007
athos glanced at aramis				118.97864408108859
m danglars however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the time of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife s favorite sitting room where by the way he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the baroness				1892.7803588379325
the other in the rue de la harpe no				939.6474584753063
now the italians and the gascons are too much alike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them may say of himself so in reaching the walls which surrounded the palais royal the cardinal knocked at a little door and after thanking d artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the palais royal he made a sign to guitant to follow him				36.7467899928336
i thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until tomorrow then we will not talk of it until tomorrow but read this paper today i will not irritate him thought edmond and taking the paper of which half was wanting having been burnt no doubt by some accident he read this treasure which may amount to two of roman crowns in the most distant a of the second opening wh declare to belong to him alo heir				8246.898177240219

it is a wretched bed but that is not my fault and it is you who have chosen it with these words he drew in his turn and crossed swords with his adversary				1780.3372746344473
m de villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed				756.001359715697
monsieur said mousqueton who abandoning his horse on the high road had come on foot to rejoin his master phoebus could no longer hold out and silence said porthos				206.9431651305721
they reached the rue st honoré and in the place du palais cardinal they found the twelve invited musketeers walking about in expectation of their comrades				4674.666138286239
grimaud was still the same and therefore he retained the entire confidence of his superior la ramee who now relied upon him more than he did upon himself for as we have said la ramee felt at the bottom of his heart a certain weakness for monsieur de beaufort				4773.202504639969
no but gaetano did i thought gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance he had not then spoken to anyone and if this person be not a smuggler who is he a wealthy signor who travels for his pleasure come thought franz he is still more mysterious since the two accounts do not agree what is his name if you ask him he says sinbad the sailor but i doubt if it be his real name sinbad the sailor yes and where does he reside on the sea what country does he come from i do not know have you ever seen him sometimes what sort of a man is he your excellency will judge for yourself where will he receive me no doubt in the subterranean palace gaetano told you of have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this island deserted to seek for this enchanted palace oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening they say that the door is not opened by a key but a magic word decidedly muttered franz this is an arabian nights adventure his excellency waits for you said a voice which he recognized as that of the sentinel				1702.3598228127296
felton remained behind he held a book in his hand				198.88855376876492
explain yourself more clearly i beg sir oh make yourself easy i am not speaking riddles and you will soon know what i mean				6159.065566416356
well they have gone to fetch her no doubt from madame de morcerf s i will await her return and beg her to come up here				1171.5427576903576
i made a sign to grimaud and the scotchman and we all three retired into a corner of the square				4706.008713402812
let each take seventy five that is enough to take us to london and back				685.8021010680432

my dear franz m maximilian morrel an excellent friend i have acquired in your absence and whose name you will hear me mention every time i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability morrel hesitated for a moment he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to franz				782.508785510947
the recent events the solitary and eccentric position of the count his enormous nay almost incredible fortune should have made men cautious and have altogether prevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum				163498.10121429598
is it only the guilty whose honor is at the sport of others sir				870.1962139384581

mercédès extended her hand to the count				312.79059565457334
it is easy to suppose that morrel s agitation would not escape the count s penetrating eye				3385.8954848690782
he then asked with whom he played				12796.345505160827

aramis and his thesis d artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his procurator s wife				1291.967276455758
my dear fellow cried he springing up is it really you				56.612785710960594

here is the story monseigneur resumed the trembling host for i now recollect you				57.000678071631256
i asked to be excused in case i should not be able to discharge my debt to all three for monsieur athos has the right to kill me first which must much diminish the face value of your bill monsieur porthos and render yours almost null monsieur aramis				170.07702957726354
you know that you are madame said villefort whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance				32862.59032442065
some wine cried the stupefied host some wine				1974.4565168011284
he was disagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience monte cristo				335.77316033030326
well monsieur i am at your service if what you say be true replied the count smiling perhaps you will be kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family certainly i will do so said the young man with a quickness which gave proof of his ready invention				157306.43005756143
with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud				218568.58136588125
i must find them within three days three days are a short time and france is large no matter you know the word must with that word great things are done and when do you set out i am now on my road good luck to you and to you a good journey perhaps we shall meet on our road that is not probable who knows				2890.673956818378

he cast himself on his knees seized the hand and touched it respectfully with his lips				459.57227975937235
with the first light dantès resumed his search				3149.648321261243
adieu i entreat you doctor all the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and fatal				146898.36373228175
the anjou wine after the most disheartening news of the king s health a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward				1282.0726571253997
don t be afraid said he smiling				660.8320718159174
as for the cellar i have searched every part and poor stuff i found monsieur mouston said d artagnan i should indeed condole with you had i not at this moment something very pressing to attend to then taking porthos aside my dear du vallon he said here you are in full dress most fortunately for i am going to take you to the cardinal s gracious me				48.36671334152097

on reaching home d artagnan found kitty waiting for him				29.702799838647238
she is quite well replied danglars quickly she is at the piano with m cavalcanti albert retained his calm and indifferent manner he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew monte cristo s eye was on him				32.99525092780239
she moved with the light free step of an arlesienne or an andalusian				87675.03541496376
excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth				1501.4821972364052
these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man				135.3576909871483
his majesty has so good a heart that he can not understand hatred is so loyal that he does not suspect treason				5379.779155498347
that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought				2156.827150385862
you are angry with us all on account of this marriage are you not yes really this is too absurd said villefort				338.06893246525516
i will not continued he after a moment s silence conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities at this almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale				744.3076179508325
but too late by a minute unfortunate unfortunate that i am felton made no resistance				4905.7404358010035
larboard your helm cried the captain to the steersman				75767.01508272892
come in here said d avrigny and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay				9347.571507135937
what must i answer the truth then i shall say the duel did not take place you will say i apologized to the count of monte cristo				299.8265542519978
you would meet the queen and she would not know who you are no but thanks to this diamond replied the young man				143.94453653624578
instead of taking the waters of forges i go and take sea waters i am free to do so				446.0897361769853
he therefore dined very silently in spite of the officious attention of his host who presented himself two or three times to inquire if he wanted anything				2474.163803192304
d artagnan seemed iron				9845.885783545404
toward six o clock d artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night				895.9421813908325
well ali my nubian believes me to be an arab bertuccio my steward takes me for a roman haydée my slave thinks me a greek				5614.956956599365
we are going to execute your wishes may heaven prosper you replied the dying man with an accent of gratitude impossible to describe				10788.425587942806
if a second traveller had passed he would have seen a strange thing a shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with ear rings and necklace of pearls diamond pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies				175205.39603323946
the young man seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamore tree in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain				6312.776818058258
by me what was his name lord winter your uncle exclaimed cromwell				2819.80955851831
his father and mother were catholics i believe his hatred of the king who deprived him of his estates and forbade him to bear the name of de winter and what name does he now bear mordaunt a puritan yet disguised as a monk he travels alone in france do you say as a monk it was thus and by mere accident may god pardon me if i blaspheme that he heard the confession of the executioner of bethune then i understand it all				195.34419541702064
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to question me on what happened there				754.8933067084006
as the hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong				16748.63952223532
the world will think you abandoned and poor for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an appearance of opulence				143056.58375125742
will you come said he to porthos				77.68625154698948
speak said the queen				310.31175032159166
the heart of d artagnan swam in delirium he marched between athos and porthos pressing them tenderly				2749.3972945924957
madame de villefort who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the procureur who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon				3590.752868756454
which is to recover a lost and adored son a lost and adored son stolen away in his infancy either by an enemy of his noble family or by the gypsies at the age of five years said the major with a deep sigh and raising his eye to heaven				593.2972021188372
i had been told that you had endeavored to escape that you had taken the place of another prisoner that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body that you had been thrown alive from the top of the château d if and that the cry you uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that they were your murderers				213494.65432758906
thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner whom notwithstanding her hints she persisted in watching all night				883.6663433117621
ah pardieu said beauchamp with the paper in your hand my friend i need not tell you the cause of my visit are you interested in the sugar question asked the editor of the ministerial paper				1128.7475191560115
i repeat it d artagnan you are the best one among us i bless and love you my dear son and to think that i couldn t find that out said porthos scratching his head it is so simple but said aramis if i understand rightly we are to kill them all eh athos shuddered and turned pale				732.2610285780089
yes replied franz here i am and he in his turn left the caves				22193.27330169476
well then with well acted good humor i allow grimaud but no one else you must manage it all				169.76467991896314
at about a league and a half from the city d artagnan finding that in his impatience he had set out too soon stopped to give the horses breathing time				684.514215085579
my dear raoul learn once for all that that is a question which is never asked				1314.8652496613374
dantès heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the sound of steps died away and then hastily displacing his bed saw by the faint light that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it				93.47339134228376
at the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall leaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter				236785.3706987869
this time it was a great matter that was under discussion connected with a vessel laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres				163920.5762898366
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by one of the many colored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of parisian belles				127433.2791168347
charles wiped his face and said with a sad smile poor wretch for half a crown he would do as much to his own father the king was not mistaken				1828.19524917229
oh cried porthos do you think so you are exaggerating athos we are not so far gone as that replied the lieutenant				6345.521758148129
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to vampa he therefore went forward without a moment s hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the trees and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a half				6899.661810351245
this something was enveloped in a cloak and d artagnan at first believed it was a man but by the smallness of the form the hesitation of the walk and the indecision of the step he soon discovered that it was a woman				413.44764310836007
the rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more the idea that he left behind him exposed to a frightful vengeance the woman he loved or rather whom he adored as a saint the emotion he had experienced present fatigue all together exalted his mind above human feeling				11314.230269591595
penelon had it would seem made good use of his money for he was newly clad				224495.38984558693
i would rather do so was edmond s reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me the patron turned towards his vessel which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed				6830.577517580437
madame said the viscount of morcerf advancing towards the countess yesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious promise but here is my friend whose character for veracity you well know and he will assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine and as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz albert put his arm round the waist of the countess and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers				104491.5909155416
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in order to distract her mind that she might forget and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the weight on her heart				357.97396571811373
when the operation was concluded and edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth and his hair reduced to its usual length he asked for a looking glass				1002.8924737466579
oh yes indeed madame continued monte cristo the secret dramas of the east begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion begin with paradise and end with hell				36716.04610241277
the young man recognized at the same instant the voices of his father and the chevalier d herblay two officers in the parisian forces rushed at that instant on raoul but aramis protected him with his sword				1371.3929687281243
he had about two hundred men in the courtyards and stables and he placed them at the queen s disposal				14133.943100780753
were consumed or nearly so he commenced complaints which athos thought nauseous porthos indecent and aramis ridiculous				15791.721033993856
then he said aloud you met him i dare say in the park hunting perhaps no nearer nearer still				6306.42856073044
you saw the person repeated the young girl				1105.3775167329702
i am sure my dear albert whatever may be your career you will soon render that name illustrious				216903.86388846845
then listen to me				50.32724983494425
athos fixed upon a certain cahusac a favorite of the cardinal s				862.2813123495112
yes sir he said				239.4777023997882
all at once felton stopped				1489.3898615328112
since the death of little edward a great change had taken place in monte cristo				345.1755984063924
it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact said athos				79.05621242901682
what is he contriving asked aramis				28.739056614399033
devil take the vain fellow said d artagnan				6.9618064342737425
franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum				5804.78089392168
now as upon this audience in his gascon imagination depended his future life he saluted aramis and porthos politely declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms and went and took his place near the cord and in the gallery				5547.842108744877
do you talk of your honor				1684.7714325408751
well continued the count in a tone that made franz shudder this young gentleman is one of my friends this young gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself this young gentleman has been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage and yet i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the count taking the letter from his pocket you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter stranger why did you not tell me all this you inquired the brigand chief turning towards his men who all retreated before his look				1736.5932266209975
m de villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in france				570.843742685003
one seemed as he raised the wine to his lips to hear him say come juice of the grape and chase away my sorrows and how he used to break the stem of a glass or the neck of a bottle				6296.771016710348
the happiest thing that could occur to me would be to die in my father s stead that would save us all your mother would die of grief my poor mother said albert passing his hand across his eyes i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided albert yes let us go but do you think we shall find the count at home he intended returning some hours after me and doubtless he is now at home they ordered the driver to take them to no				917.5317842170333
but enough of money matters				4553.379540402566
the sentinel wanted to repulse him but felton called to the officer of the post and drawing from his pocket the letter of which he was the bearer he said a pressing message from lord de winter at the name of lord de winter who was known to be one of his grace s most intimate friends the officer of the post gave orders to let felton pass who besides wore the uniform of a naval officer				1376.237981737974
the fronde is a comedy of which the first act only is played				11572.26027382102
d artagnan believed this cough to be a signal				2388.8726782104395
milady seemed overcome with joy and made kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de wardes when he received the letter how he had responded what was the expression of his face if he seemed very amorous				84414.97867827692
sir said madame de saint méran without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no time to lose you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child yes madame replied villefort it is not only projected but arranged your intended son in law is named m franz d épinay yes madame is he not the son of general d épinay who was on our side and who was assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of elba the same does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished mother said villefort m				706.175679381722
the count stood alone and at a sign from his hand the carriage went on for a short distance				2221.4077101161574
a retired baker asked the fruiteress				193402.95245308007
marseilles the arrival on the of february the look out at notre dame de la garde signalled the three master the pharaon from smyrna trieste and naples				7927.395273857642
he called successively at the abodes of athos porthos and aramis				203.61981757786887
these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort la pointe and superintend her embarkation				117794.49028643164
you see there are two wanting eight days my lord i will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if i can have them by the day after tomorrow my lord they shall be yours you are a jewel of a man mr o reilly but that is not all				185.41086121272875
on being left alone with mme				193.97675693751688
now said albert that you have seen all my treasures allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are				865.7106742680819
he then went out backward and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him in his enthusiasm crying aloud long life to the monseigneur				3692.6403494401516
it is raoul who has worked in me the change you see i was dried up like a miserable tree isolated attached to nothing on earth it was only a deep affection that could make me take root again and drag me back to life				560.7419548151387
the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor				2508.474926002649
he has grown a good deal it seems to me and he sat down in the hall choosing a conspicuous place				586.1270569223886
cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend s entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to rita s father at frosinone				155403.3417055279
that night a memorable event occurred due no doubt to the imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights				21047.366322081052
nevertheless whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker or whether without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey she resolutely drew near to aramis s shutter and tapped at three equal intervals with her bent finger				1869.3074393532183
a vessel was setting sail for algiers on board of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed				38150.839999646865
we have already wasted too much the king again shook hands with all three exchanged hats with winter and went out				542.8323982250882
this house is part of valentine s marriage portion and m de saint méran wished to sell it for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin it was morrel s turn to become pale				730.1557766529514
the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the distance gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks were in reality gigantic fir trees and myrtles				20122.76285440567
albert is ten minutes after time there he comes said beauchamp on horseback at full gallop followed by a servant how imprudent said château renaud to come on horseback to fight a duel with pistols after all the instructions i had given him and besides said beauchamp with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat				9654.445477116866
the queen had them				87.9609064876145
after whitsuntide it would be another thing there is nothing so convincing as a firm conviction				4788.974150690091
indeed said d artagnan monsters have only to complain to gain your sympathy				18093.5771671603
aramis pushed his back into his saddle bags and sheathed his sword				1375.5556598727433
from that time he had watched them and profiting by the moment when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at length had her in his power when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his heart				377.06798356985166

more than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a moment if maximilian morrel had been named albert de morcerf or raoul de château renaud but morrel was of plebeian extraction and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint méran despised all who were not noble				17227.01919982046
you see said danglars addressing caderousse the turn things have taken				1863.0819078568113
here it is i see at this very moment friquet passed mounted on raoul s horse waving his parti colored cap and crying broussel				10798.976604504944
now my friends said athos finish them at a blow				2414.3572582459096
villefort looked at her with that piercing glance which reads the secrets of the heart				406.81575230082285
i know very well that during the last four or five years misfortune has seemed to pursue m morrel				277.5249277750876
as for me i have almost forgotten the little latin i have ever known				6521.2084285763885
but are you seriously wounded				6879.556268455382
monsieur de belliere said he to one of them do me the favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private stair and wait for me there it is an affair of importance on the service of the king the musketeer who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of jesting with regard to the service obeyed without a word although he thought the order strange				9251.312160722175
i will allow myself to die with hunger come said the wretch is not peace much better than such a war as that				706.5087846857413
oh why is not the world a wilderness she exclaimed throwing herself into the arms of mademoiselle d armilly her eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero wish that the roman world had but one neck that he might sever it at a single blow				2387.6450404456677
thanks for your devotedness gentlemen				989.6956960567422
most decidedly said he men are not equal and i must beg my father to develop this theorem in the chamber of peers chapter				285.73221073219787
some of the chieftains left the ranks and broke their swords in two				1376.0673695481046
the four friends followed him				36.55816704067476
a few seconds afterward d artagnan also went out enveloped in a large cloak which ill concealed the sheath of a long sword				1380.6523636559018
there d artagnan was asleep upon a bench				22741.70446529729
the mission with which i am charged sir replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential one on the part of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed the abbé bowed				1328.367074994836
he turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdinière				239506.61765988547
but cried anne of austria tired of these vague attacks but sire you do not tell me all that you have in your heart				378.28900042767503
oh the magnificent hair said louise with regret				13650.274258077694
then he pressed the hand the baroness reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the door				192.52210742610305
fortunately the reader may remember or may not remember fortunately we have promised not to lose sight of him				35.24227381326453
• you provide in accordance with paragraph f a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within days of receipt of the work				1622.8299151487915
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the room like a madman his footstep was heard one moment in the corridor then the rattling of his carriage wheels as he was driven rapidly away				1034.7977629099742
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came death and after death if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness				144815.51547093224
the night was extremely dark				5079.676479432983
as night closed in they arrived at thirsk				321572.65189284424
it is right said athos he has served your majesty longer than we have the king overheard these words and turned around with tears in his eyes				603.6005371052743
the court of anne of austria was full of gayety and animation for after having gained a victory over the spaniard it had just gained another over the people				1447.27696899164
the two friends mounted as did their servants				5724.866670665769
ah what is that cried the brigadier				156965.05748797194
now then do you wish for anything else said the patron				40949.08573151483
it was caracalla s circus				295118.67063148104
it is well as it is say no more about it at least you should tell me what i should have to do in london replied bonacieux who remembered a little too late that rochefort had desired him to endeavor to obtain his wife s secrets				12039.169685410761
say the devil my dear friend said d artagnan if you annoy us in this manner we will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar and we will see if the mischief is as great as you say oh gentlemen said the host i have been wrong				6342.787041976459
all the rest of the square was paved with heads				6309.815508953838
in fact at one of the doors which opened into the queen s apartment appeared the pretty mme				215.80183615221424
this evening sir he replied all will be ready chapter xlvi				5782.414889798221
i have told you my wish or rather my determination				278106.1122244987
that is a large sum				3732.3823825613595
the lackey bowed and let them pass				3272.003502765807
athos alone kept away and sat in the furthest corner of the room as if determined to be merely a spectator of the proceedings				287336.13525282894
d artagnan was a physiognomist				217944.14532747428
and the scotch they kept their word and never stirred said mordaunt				1706.967849986703
the lackeys followed their masters and the chamber was left solitary with its broken window its open door and its smoky lamp burning sadly on the table				695.5470896192714
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires to this athos replied quietly we also have money left for i have not yet drunk all my share of the diamond and porthos and aramis have not eaten all theirs				12326.856753083905
all i can do for you is to make you one of the agents of that providence the bargain was concluded				134611.77132394613
this house in past years did ours a great service and has i know not for what reason always denied having rendered us this service i shall be at your orders said monte cristo bowing				1245.6969682987028
you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear monsieur cavalcanti i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the abbé busoni i had not provided myself with any other funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said monte cristo				270.0316980835635
excuse me said the banker but you will tire yourself baroness by such late hours and m debray lives some distance from here debray was petrified not only to hear danglars speak so calmly and politely but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his wife might wish to do				1305.0155331372807
and this explains how d artagnan had quarters in the rue tiquetonne at the hotel de la chevrette				8839.25549019317
charles stuart had asked that bishop juxon might be permitted to visit him				30.58492353506211
there said the king that consoles me they are not all traitors at this moment winter s voice was raised with the cry of forward the first squadron moved off the second followed and descended from the plateau				204660.123770446
suddenly a dull and heavy noise was heard				719.9430663714228
on their arrival at the castle they learned that buckingham and the king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away				1041.6792203347902
he has killed the executioner of bethune in an access of passion but now his fury is assuaged de winter smiled sorrowfully and shook his head				400.70885300110245
but also said mazarin you must understand that if i ask this service from you it is with the intention of being grateful is it still only an intention your eminence asked d artagnan				73.76291609916487
and shall we take no notice of this incident m de morcerf turned pale and clenched his hands on the papers he held				5832.537468584043
what wounded man the former executioner of bethune who has just been brought in here assassinated by spaniards and who is now being confessed by an augustine friar the old executioner of bethune muttered grimaud a man between fifty five and sixty tall strong swarthy black hair and beard that is he except that his beard has turned gray and his hair is white do you know him asked the host				603.9039747504011
this was groslow				2198.2344068154493
this time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party to speak				1052.5258600526479
he had given his word not to watch mme				157.46994570566144
athos repeated m de tréville himself				201.90117771453833
my dear landlady said d artagnan i beg to introduce to you your brother who is arrived from flanders and whom i am going to take into my service my brother wish your sister good morning master peter wilkom suster said planchet				757.9396691188111
unfortunately for him the line of carriages moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the other ascended towards the palazzo di venezia				117384.83509371306
i once loved her much and to do her justice she was very useful to us				356.01583295927634
when he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with a feeling of self satisfaction				3604.3769772957276
i wish them to be promulgated immediately but my lord if the lord chancellor interrogates me upon the motives which may have led your grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure what shall i reply that such is my pleasure and that i answer for my will to no man will that be the answer replied the secretary smiling which he must transmit to his majesty if by chance his majesty should have the curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of great britain you are right mr jackson replied buckingham				1044.1627527375497
the sailors looked at one another				1065.7714088719133
richelieu slowly tore the paper which d artagnan had generously relinquished				35210.278533496974
i thought you would never come in what s the matter now planchet demanded d artagnan				50.48557253043565
i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the diamond but to my inexpressible astonishment he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to place entire belief in all i said				418.2225065470993
but i am grateful i swear to you but what does this note contain milady will tell you ah you do not love me cried kitty and i am very wretched to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women				2713.201936316276
i am not mistaken d artagnan cried rochefort				697.0338619494989
i confess this is the drollest thing i have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity				3934.3468117015104
not to arouse suspicions gentlemen said he go your way and i will go mine and this evening at nine o clock we will assemble again at the gate saint denis				5028.973432302272
go on go on said he between his teeth expend your ardor the first day to morrow instead of journeying twenty leagues you will travel ten the day after to morrow five and in three days you will be in bed				761.3260693096081
the horse and servant belonging to de winter were waiting for him at the door he proceeded toward his abode very thoughtfully looking behind him from time to him to contemplate the dark and silent frontage of the louvre				3031.0879782134966
but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred the profound hatred the inveterate hatred of milady was increased by his not having killed her brother in law				1719.0773462278896
meanwhile what are you going to do i yes you it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me since you interest yourself in my affairs i think it is now my turn to ask you some questions ah true				1074.496632532721
i said a million replied danglars with the confidence of ignorance				4596.520687548215
you pretend not to know because government was not rich enough ah pardon me said château renaud i have heard of these things every day during the last eight years and i can not understand them yet you will by and by said debray				369.0814745503871
dantès was on the way he desired to follow and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom				2976.7989395698683
dantès had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god				590.3659210941152
he will not desert monsieur the cardinal be assured of that i will answer for him no he will not desert said the king he can always be found as tréville says				22139.008798541796
besides d artagnan passed the evening with me well said the cardinal everybody seems to have passed the evening with you does your eminence doubt my word said tréville with a brow flushed with anger				4077.4057085620866
the worn out steps were old acquaintances of his he knew better than anyone else how to open that weather beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within				2418.5134091114146
a sort of smile played on his lips				454.4765635974645
your interview will be private				165596.46744348796
meantime d artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier attacking him with his sword				1378.56895428614
over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persia s sun or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta or of chandernagor				123494.66639966227
the count in his survey of the pit encountered a pale face and threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain his attention				1135.6151350949362
what said the count do you still regret anything in the world and yet die oh i entreat you exclaimed morrel in a low voice do not speak another word count do not prolong my punishment the count fancied that he was yielding and this belief revived the horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the château d if				4378.1572759793535
it is for you replied a gendarme				21235.598338806172
the second contained the duke and duchess of orleans the tall young mademoiselle and the abbé de la riviere and the third the duke de longueville and the prince de conti brother and brother in law of condé				256599.97358846877
they were parting to meet again when it pleased god and if it pleased god				500.5043180528543
ah sir said d artagnan you have a wicked smile				499.2505444065687
sir replied the wounded man believe me there is no time to lose the ball has broken the thigh bone and entered the intestines are you a surgeon asked de guiche				4338.426608711113
he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred man				118.6319415644962
my dear friend said the baroness while the two young people were shaking hands i and eugénie are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince cavalcanti danglars kept up the title of prince				1291.8662468933771
why there is nothing to prove that the general was murdered				16932.98180617415
i comprehend				8970.08326875537
the little boat bounded over the waves like a nut shell				119954.76533023431
no it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it i yes you				65.18021497166515
you marry a money bag label it is true well but what does that matter				1376.0726188385488
yes for the mother s sake his poor mother cried the major taking a third biscuit				15516.054585538655
the sergeant answered that puritans never drank and put the crown piece in his pocket				1353.753168592062
the boat sailed on all day and all night and next morning when the sun rose they had lost sight of monte cristo				362.61720282381253
there is our wine in bottles and our wine in casks the beer the oil and the spices the bacon and sausages				34199.6269972989
do you absolutely think that the palais royal is the abode of gayety				20035.09996494194
now these reflections had led him further than he intended and the day was beginning to decline when by the last ray of the setting sun he thought he saw the barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge				11936.278854330958
the count wished to speak but a gush of blood stifled him				31.784254433440882
well after all said d artagnan supposing that he lives that he comes to paris we have seen many other such				31898.44976025509
do you know in what crime you are to day engaged				22505.261429356862
she will save us said conti				19197055.897571158
formerly a brewer replied the gascon				1161.7336402912763
the sergeant drew near to planchet				607.254769114892
a bargain was therefore struck				1890.3216113273536
my death will be much more eloquent than my life and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner be silent madame cried felton and do not speak to me thus i came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor to swear to me by what you hold most sacred that you will make no attempt upon your life i will not promise said milady for no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than i have and if i make a promise i must keep it well said felton only promise till you have seen me again				291.3715248869296
but it is beginning again i say well said the count astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at maximilian let it begin again it is like the house of the atreidae god has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment				4267.11045699784
gentlemen said andrea commanding silence by his voice and manner i owe you the proofs and explanations of what i have said but said the irritated president you called yourself benedetto declared yourself an orphan and claimed corsica as your country i said anything i pleased in order that the solemn declaration i have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the case				3291.8971608682505
poor man he is a worthy creature he left the porter to ponder on these words not knowing which most to admire the master or the servant				1696.1345698946047
till tomorrow evening then till tomorrow evening then replied i allowing myself to fall and biting the carpet with rage felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture and milady saw with the joy of a demon that his strength would fail him perhaps before the end of her recital				7817.953396839574
porthos rubbed his hands in feverish impatience				5067.763663311811
we will talk italian and spanish				170576.61845225727
i do not hem said d artagnan there is some truth in what you say ah				426.6371782290942
have you never heard that queen anne of austria was once saved from the greatest danger ever incurred by a queen yes at the time of her relations with monsieur de buckingham it had to do in some way with certain studs and diamonds well it was that affair madame these men are the ones who saved her and i smile with pity when i reflect that if the names of those gentlemen are unknown to you it is because the queen has forgotten them who ought to have made them the first noblemen of the realm well then my lord they must be found but what can four men or rather three men do for i tell you you must not count on monsieur d artagnan it will be one valiant sword the less but there will remain still three without reckoning my own now four devoted men around the king to protect him from his enemies to be at his side in battle to aid him with counsel to escort him in flight are sufficient not to make the king a conqueror but to save him if conquered and whatever mazarin may say once on the shores of france your royal husband may find as many retreats and asylums as the seabird finds in a storm seek then my lord seek these gentlemen and if they will consent to go with you to england i will give to each a duchy the day that we reascend the throne besides as much gold as would pave whitehall				42256.24268060642
chapter lii				10536.66288390059
the crowd whilst preserving an appearance of respect and even of affection for the king and queen regent began to be tumultuous				165757.31325831683
i have it gentlemen the right idea has just occurred to me tell us allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders athos made a sign for his lackey to approach				3300.1515510460245
i saw him from the window madame he is a young man that appears scarce sixteen years of age and is called the viscount de bragelonne the queen smiling made a sign with her head the young princess opened the door and raoul appeared on the threshold				2518.7972123255763
then the idea of this marriage really grieves you too				3178.4589897940336
stop said he i have an idea well that s something for i have not the shadow of one said athos coolly but as to d artagnan gentlemen the idea of belonging to ours has driven him out of his senses				2139.6405680857574
then as the crowd gradually dispersed he leaped down crept from behind the drapery glided between two horses mingled with the crowd and was the first to arrive at the inn				1250.47529209172
the first time i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets				101628.12762950175
sir said beauchamp who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the count who is absent from paris at this moment and can not justify himself i accuse no one sir said danglars i relate and i will repeat before the count what i have said to you does the count know what answer you received yes i showed it to him did he know my father s christian name was fernand and his family name mondego yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any other would have done in my circumstances and perhaps less				14564.687437828257
she crushed the paper in her hand and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty she cried what is this letter the answer to madame s replied kitty all in a tremble				1077.5330608111074
oh and more especially a notorious coward oh oh				521.0241701370828
adieu i will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him go straight to his box that will be the simplest plan but i have never been presented presented to whom to the beautiful greek you say she is only a slave while you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess				5638.798987531013
but aramis was livid				3004.790659677997
and you want my blessing he said				348.0710068976879
when you pay me a visit in my cell my young friend said he i will show you an entire work the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of my whole life many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the foot of st mark s column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the time that they would be arranged in order within the walls of the château d if				4526.117129899978
they re entered the boat which had brought them to the louvre and thence proceeded to the halles and taking up grimaud and blaisois they went on foot to the rue guenegaud				37173.36743200218
i will not detain you monsieur continued the countess i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate my dear count said albert i will endeavor to return your politeness at rome and place my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready a thousand thanks for your kindness viscount returned the count of monte cristo but i suppose that m bertuccio has suitably employed the four hours and a half i have given him and that i shall find a carriage of some sort ready at the door albert was used to the count s manner of proceeding he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and nothing astonished him but wishing to judge with his own eyes how far the count s orders had been executed he accompanied him to the door of the house				501.04827876510063
aramis my good friend this time you are wrong interrupted porthos				148.12102985481835
the minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed france from the inveterate enemy who set all europe against her				209.33672349806238
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we can not comprehend we have been guided by an invisible hand a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter oh cried julie i have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand as i now kiss the purse which he has touched				12364.061133821693
about forty leagues only				4675.24572838801
i m no thief but an honest citizen well off in the world with a house of my own				976.7405676002453
in each there was an enemy to contend with and contributions to be levied				137367.3246134448
he was the son of a banker at lyons named particelli who after becoming a bankrupt chose to change his name to emery and cardinal richelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude had introduced him with a strong recommendation to louis xiii				768.132240467024
yet you have need i believe to be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken for if i mistake not you came to paris with the ambitious idea of making your fortune i am at the age of extravagant hopes monseigneur said d artagnan				65.84289956740366
what do you see a troop of how many persons twenty men what sort of men sixteen pioneers four soldiers how far distant five hundred paces good				1552.0456899482401
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom house officers as my appearance before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always looks back into the past				1248.6502407491582
at this athos would smile with his charming melancholy smile which so became his noble countenance and porthos would drink swearing that aramis would never be anything but a village curé				204510.08606347025

this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of circumstances nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement something in fact more than is apparent on a casual view of the subject				1152.1445403386244
listen to me my dear girl said the gascon who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made athos you must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation				7798.019726154444
nevertheless while acknowledging the truth of what he said i thought proper to insist but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any discussion with me he took one of his pistols laid it on his table day and night and said that at the first word that should be spoken to him about removing either within the house or out of it he would blow out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle with a matter which only concerned himself				184.26419728787815

anybody may possess a five franc piece but do you suppose i carry five hundred francs about with me				89.36897023779584
come d artagnan don t let us play a sidelong game your hesitation your evasion tells me at once on whose side you are for that party no one dares openly to recruit and when people recruit for it it is with averted eyes and humble voice ah				461.5813616355471

d artagnan whose mind was never more fertile in resources than in critical emergencies swore again that he would try all conceivable means to prevent the dénouement of the bloody tragedy				38611.963545622966
the past chapter				219.5546300630513
it was evening i had thrown the body into the river and those words which my remorse repeats to me are those which i in my pride pronounced				35021.76800085685
the cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm you may depend upon it he will repay you by some ill turn but of what sort eh				1962.4280565798128
they began dinner and spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message				7172.310256935761
and why not asked the young man				140.52185731305178
what has happened asked the countess as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of life did you say a misfortune				1917.0141642463152
shall i complain of him demanded the inspector				3211.230528449376
it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had for a cause the danger which mme				217.65924762627776
a man who had sworn vengeance against my father and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried me				75.5795884432795
a candle of coarse tallow on a black table lighted up the handsome and resigned face of the king and that of his faithful retainer far less calm				6161.773957095167
the man was m de villefort i fully believed that when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the whole of the garden alone and asked the count did you ever know the name of this woman no excellency returned bertuccio you will see that i had no time to learn it go on that evening continued bertuccio i could have killed the procureur but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the spot and that if his cries were overheard i might be taken so i put it off until the next occasion and in order that nothing should escape me i took a chamber looking into the street bordered by the wall of the garden				2326.553770087771
well for my part i a bloodthirsty ruffian who can go and stand close to a scaffold in order to have a better view of the king s execution i remain athos turned pale				761.7196939898073
can not monsieur cromwell wait a little yes but i said mordaunt				1634.1157587505286
i called the valet i stopped the postilion i spoke to m de saint méran i applied my smelling salts but all was over and i arrived at aix by the side of a corpse villefort stood with his mouth half open quite stupefied				3032.1490400549797
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variétés i purchased mine at constantinople it cost me more but i have nothing to fear but you forget replied debray laughing that we are franks by name and franks by nature as king charles said and that the moment she puts her foot in france your slave becomes free who will tell her the first person who sees her she only speaks romaic that is different but at least we shall see her said beauchamp or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes oh no replied monte cristo i do not carry brutalism so far				12120.502196901936
an old proverb says like master like man let us pass then from the valet of athos to the valet of porthos from grimaud to mousqueton				1489.8700317041648
it will then be said of me that i died for the king so that i shall have performed my duty without the expense of an outfit porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him tossing his head and repeating i shall follow up on my idea aramis anxious and negligently dressed said nothing				717.1526884876431
then it was not in society that i met with mademoiselle or yourself madame or this charming little merry boy				1108.693629379938
is the officer referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist				77681.5545923307
never mind continued the young man smuggler or not you must agree mother dear as you have seen him that the count of monte cristo is a remarkable man who will have the greatest success in the salons of paris				494.75158401894123
these two gentlemen shall decide between us but first i will state the case to them				103.20234444523203
what more well i i m not rich				2115.864876823842
if we are attacked we will defend ourselves if we are tried we will stoutly maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of times in the sea				625.5623998603788
your eminence may be certain of that the cardinal turned and said in a loud voice rochefort the chevalier who no doubt was near the door entered immediately				1169.9115625226202
then he took the boy upon his knee				6876.906193131452
for me				76.8886011109702
what name did you pronounce then madame de morcerf said he				127.25571408298013
yes i was expected and very impatiently i acknowledge a slight shade passed over the brow of bonacieux but so slight that d artagnan did not perceive it				90.22800358669052
dantès did not comprehend the jest but his hair stood erect on his head				362.0301325716412
nevertheless if the affairs of our family are arranged as we hope they will be i believe she will run the risk of being damned and will return to those she regrets particularly as she knows they are always thinking of her				198.9672844333513
at that moment i encountered the eye of the prince				1314.2716368499584
i tremble to give my permission listen valentine				319.96522513017914
he that man what man that cursed man my evil genius whom i have always met with when threatened by some misfortune he who accompanied that horrible woman when i met her for the first time he whom i was seeking when i offended our athos he whom i saw on the very morning madame bonacieux was abducted				121111.95375566061
speak doctor i am listening said villefort strike i am prepared for everything madame de saint méran was doubtless advancing in years but she enjoyed excellent health morrel began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten minutes				3878.525352673552
morcerf repeated debray				359.87679538167976
silence he said or you are lost				816.7559908471472
with this consoling idea i leave you madame and most prudent wife without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have friends left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the liberty i hasten to restore to you				55.54602265000948
a silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure entered and joined the musketeers				727.5457305951346
a bad reason replied danglars who reckoned on conciliating his keeper but i am content				30220.004482488897
how ought she really to be supremely loved				5658.601654303205
the enemy s army extended from cassel to courtray and as there was no species of violence or pillage it did not commit the poor people on the frontier quitted their isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong cities which held out a shelter to them				113.33608940684897
porthos my friend said d artagnan don t distrust providence				4916.390840620873
can we do anything for you asked athos				11.182499737004717
there s no second constance in the world on his return to the cathedral d artagnan saw bazin who was conversing with the sacristan				192523.31931988252
the foundation s ein or federal tax identification number is				1401.0329660712923
i have the honor to inquire from your majesty what you desire monsieur d herblay and myself to do in your service				1961.7815538903792
as for our two prisoners you can imagine that they are but little in the vein for conversation they are hot royalists said groslow				2694.6870688456584
in case of any attempt to escape the penalty of death is to be applied				194039.9601468083
what do you think of this he asked in a low voice				725.3315885980837
morcerf thanked him with a smile and pushed open the door above which were his arms and which as we have said opened into the salon				3609.1822278063914
and nothing more				1007.0034951392729
stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden				2276.670224963831
but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with ungovernable fury the nubian smiled				482.50823764333956
wait an instant and he pointed his gun at d artagnan who was riding toward him at full speed				1687.344152061693
in one of the mourning coaches beauchamp debray and château renaud were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness				40197.1371102507
this box contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished gold sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the box				2278.695771281668
lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient bertuccio bowed and left the room				197.2378728428923
then resuming his mild air you are deceived gentlemen said he this handkerchief is not mine and i can not fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me rather than to one of you and as a proof of what i say here is mine in my pocket so saying he pulled out his own handkerchief likewise a very elegant handkerchief and of fine cambric though cambric was dear at the period but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms only ornamented with a single cipher that of its proprietor				196443.73480076974
arrived in his bedroom the count motioned to ali to stop then he passed into the dressing room which he examined				186139.1306268068
he will say in that case to the king that i am determined on war and that this measure is my first act of hostility against france the secretary bowed and retired				889.5758548025391
wretched men their officers wish to see you sir i have no time to see them				84.00807889135253
but the skilful manner in which dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château d if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going like that of kings was accompanied with salutes of artillery				271944.7776859293
the youths spurred on				1004.6337348749548
in the meantime grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master with the musketoon on his shoulder and his head shaking				183991.7744999226
go i will reflect gondy looked at mazarin astonished and mazarin approached the queen to speak to her but at this moment a frightful tumult arose from the square of the palais royal				2365.0133645291803
signor pastrini informed them that business had called him to civita vecchia				139325.10854853853
they advanced and athos who was the first to enter gazed a moment in silence on that pale and noble face framed in its long and now untidy matted hair the blue veins showing through the transparent temples his eyes seemingly swollen by tears				1287.3170348831325
why do we love				801.2816751907536
you are not judges				5836.877708785342
what is this said aramis on seeing them arrive				6918.282056156272
to the wall to the wall and the four friends seconded by grimaud pushed with the barrels of their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall which bent as if pushed by the wind and detaching itself from its base fell with a horrible crash into the ditch				102469.07475468316
ay said porthos if we can not leave the camp our lackeys may to be sure they may and this very day we will write the letters said aramis				194.01042815806272
what said the notary do you not intend making mademoiselle valentine de villefort your residuary legatee no you are not making any mistake are you said the notary you really mean to declare that such is not your intention no repeated noirtier no valentine raised her head struck dumb with astonishment				2245.0843569268955
my deduction is replied villefort that my father led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human justice but marked by the justice of god				606.140401419364
i have brought him up				967.8242827739605
monte cristo did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the window calling ali a horse for m de morcerf quick				6373.796945697189
the windows on the ground floor according to a custom in provincial villages were barred so that they strongly resembled the windows of a prison				1236.935616008426
he could like the king touch the greatest of us on the head and touching them make such heads shake on their shoulders				893.4366369829542
now that i have the word of athos i can set out d artagnan started alone on his journey without other escort than his sword and with a simple passport from mazarin to secure his admission to the queen s presence				2604.0131057733856
let us leave them she said				259.43173753774647
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all states of the united states				2321.8270413319137
ah is it you dantès cried the man in the skiff				62590.377833756065
either they respect or they fear me which is more likely but they let me trample down the clover with my dogs insult and obstruct every one and i come back still more weary and low spirited that s all				181.33289645876798
did the sun shine in my eyes and she leaned against the window				445.9738231108185
it was a good augury				45545.06688954417
it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge				326956.44486387115
i shall kneel down to pray do not strike then when shall i strike when i shall lay my head on the block and say remember then strike boldly gentlemen said the king to those around him i leave you to brave the tempest i go before you to a kingdom which knows no storms				247171.3606663374
deeply engaged with a sort of inward contemplation valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the conversation				568.4707537342487
something better still mouston an expedition sir asked the steward whose roses began to change into lilies				279561.470611434
he did not dare to write for fear of not being able to such experienced eyes as those of milady to disguise his writing sufficiently				14161.210789679944
fighting here are you				72.60527064035446
come to our house tomorrow				1580.3871218881523
now his plans were fully made and this is what he intended to do				1302.204615058353
i don t very well know what but still something monseigneur said d artagnan this was what happened to me never mind never mind resumed the cardinal with a smile which indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it				64.91873352943115
i am just setting out for blois				5771.693545536178
as long as he was in the city planchet kept at the respectful distance he had imposed upon himself but as soon as the road began to be more lonely and dark he drew softly nearer so that when they entered the bois de boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side with his master				1362.7284037315842
something like a smile was perceptible on madame de villefort s countenance				652.9849172426432
these gentlemen read it to me and i wept for joy but at any rate you know where he is monsieur d artagnan asked raoul somewhat comforted				73288.56563139992
go gentlemen he said you must be much fatigued after your voyage				12216.985816259055
dantès eyes sparkled with joy and he rubbed his hands with delight at the idea of a plan so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed				4608.674871742515
m the epistle is laconic said d artagnan and if there had not been a postscript probably i should not have understood it but happily there is a postscript and he read that welcome postscript which made him forget the abruptness of the letter				562.4542080762837
obey that person implicitly				126700.50308436417
i beg your pardon said aramis noticing his awkwardness if i had known that i was to have the honor of your visit i should have procured the gardener s ladder but for me alone this is good enough sir said planchet when he saw d artagnan on the summit of the ladder this way is easy for monsieur aramis and even for you in case of necessity i might also climb up but my two horses can not mount the ladder take them to yonder shed my friend said aramis pointing to a low building on the plain there you will find hay and straw for them then come back here and clap your hands three times and we will give you wine and food				1704.8618448049265
the sum was collected in a minute				30104.082617136093
i don t know him				34.64914553914834
pull down the blinds said d artagnan				6.877806542809254
i say sire that there is now but one way open				1439.7762850817674
if she is a cardinalist she has no fanaticism at least she then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal upon his enemies				1098.5439855235666
the very name assumed by his host of monte cristo and again repeated by the landlord of the hôtel de londres abundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gaëta as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further franz bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended				26406.084982417346
there exist no imprecations she did not pour out against you				49.34410246440078
the young man obeyed mounted on the table and divining the wishes of his companion placed his back securely against the wall and held out both hands				554.9580242714553
and what friends awaited him without				50082.8076410133
eight days had been occupied in preparations at the hôtel de ville for this important evening				576.0862785682882
then the curate forbade me to quit my uniform and the jesuit entreated me to get him made a musketeer without a thesis cried d artagnan without a thesis				17887.471169094686
lift it and judge if i am mistaken the young man raised the arm which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless				75004.3763803245
the country was beautiful intersected by valleys as green as the emerald				37964.25033158962
good god cried he laughing i quite despair of my poor michon she will never write like monsieur de voiture what does you mean by boor michon said the swiss who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came				2234.12531391903
could the prisoners see each other he asked				1216.5741305094168
what am i to do nothing very difficult but what is it to repeat these signs monte cristo took a paper from his pocket upon which were drawn three signs with numbers to indicate the order in which they were to be worked				24923.125059565373
i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer				19187.289362440184
there seems to be only one thing to do which is to send our names to her majesty the queen of england and if she engages to answer for us i presume we shall be allowed to enter on hearing these words the shortest of the other three men seemed more attentive than ever to what was going on wrapping his cloak around him more carefully than before				862.8768888685527
danglars did not even look at her though she did her best to faint				4234.452711632786
but the story of the crab made a great noise through the interior of the donjon and even outside				9449.805761542166
as the distance increased between the travellers and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land				3898.993122951846
from lyons to avignon still by steamboat				21324.08020903837
bonacieux was the very life of d artagnan				69.44769526056211
he turned ali pointed to the window of the room in which they were facing the street				1143.676819499865
well as you please i even gain something by it for i no longer see that wicked smile of yours				2864.6958870581884

dantès made no resistance he was like a man in a dream he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of steps he was conscious that he passed through a door and that the door closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist				110587.42131230874

still in spite of this albert displayed his most dazzling and effective costumes each time he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and one of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure				3530.10074057712

she did not please she intoxicated				232127.81165427438
now said the count let us follow him franz and the count in their turn then advanced along the same path which at the distance of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley				190899.066951131
mistrust yourself john said he				7.621240122355493

you know we can not yet pronounce him guilty he is in safe custody answered villefort and rely upon it if the letter is found he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman and where is the unfortunate being asked renée				23693.93068336091

is he still amusing himself in italy i believe so however he regrets your absence extremely				271969.9354842863
when d artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery athos had been waiting about five minutes and twelve o clock was striking				13693.509995410786
i shall find him there without doubt you will monsieur he persists in remaining there				746.1661321818304
they sat down to dinner				1932.2448124286507
well did there not happen an event which saved austria				2201.8211250245467
at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden staircase that led from the upper floor and with many bows and courteous smiles the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to enter				1835.7007017997478
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation				5226.88181274318
he was quite prepared for any such encounter				212466.29011187103
you have all the appearance of being cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman perhaps so and i have an excuse for mine would not be the first hand of a man that has been placed upon you i imagine and the baron pointed with a slow and accusing gesture to the left shoulder of milady which he almost touched with his finger				1847.9170157819474
a slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty				6314.035193083812
my god can you not remember her name yes it was pronounced in my hearing once				996.1228392704048

yes said they we have promised to deliver scotland and england from him who for the last five and twenty years has sucked the blood and gold of scotland and england				896.405833418127
he took a hundred and fifty men and attempted to go out by the pont du louvre but there he met rochefort and his fifty horsemen attended by more than five hundred men				1215.6752956993969
therefore in spite of olivain s remarks he continued to urge his steed more and more and following a pleasant little path leading to a ferry and which he had been assured shortened the journey by the distance of one league he arrived at the summit of a hill and perceived the river flowing before him				34.40813858757607
go and see cocles and if my father is there announce this gentleman it will be useless to announce me mademoiselle returned the englishman				1260.895407916789
at that instant the little side gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young man appeared				1153.7443613404478
my death then will not be to her as the death of a stranger laporte burst into tears				1290.8748516667906
already dantès had visited this maritime bourse two or three times and seeing all these hardy free traders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds				25726.95151161907
these proceedings made d artagnan and porthos draw back				652.177107369243
besides he feared that by resisting longer he should appear selfish in the eyes of athos				198.78748273390806
prorsus admirabile continued aramis but which requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers				11828.94155258946
yes let us go to the library please the marquis took his arm and they left the salon				3448.0826986658967
every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every part of his body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest thus multiplying his agony a thousand fold				180423.41552992843
at length happier than the young man who sobbed without weeping tears glistened in the eyes of noirtier				1809.9642871131032
get on the coachman bestowed a heavy blow of the whip upon his horses the noble animals bounded forward then cries of men who were knocked down were heard then a double concussion was felt and two of the wheels seemed to pass over a round and flexible body				352.05776965018345
why you have drunk more than a hundred pistoles worth				24543.725431906663
good to eat he said and put it in his pocket				1274.5903789760957
and what else does your worship wish for to know if you have seen a young man pass fifteen years of age mounted on a chestnut horse and followed by a groom the viscount de bragelonne				1603.8553072939715
my dear friend cried aramis				29.49024903702674
on guard but said he whom d artagnan thus provoked it appears to me that this place is badly chosen and that we should be better behind the abbey st germain or in the pré aux clercs what you say is full of sense replied d artagnan but unfortunately i have very little time to spare having an appointment at twelve precisely				106825.59061509607
with this animal which he called pistache he was often shut up for hours alone superintending as every one supposed its education				178906.19370693588
now allowing for contrary winds accidents and a woman s weakness there are twelve days well monsieur duke said the king have you made your calculations yes sire				10450.23005999278
during the whole five years in which the duc de beaufort had been in prison not a day had passed in which the cardinal had not felt a secret dread of his escape				4224.14341550373
prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no				905.719061899736
the coadjutor whose eyes devoured her slightest movements seized the paper immediately the signature had been affixed to it returned to the window and waved it in his hand				188.01302276711752
do you know what those three windows were worth two or three hundred roman crowns two or three thousand the deuce does his island produce him such a revenue it does not bring him a bajocco then why did he purchase it for a whim he is an original then in reality observed albert he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at paris and a frequenter of the theatres i should say he was a poor devil literally mad				3843.0574969983686
you can come and dine three times a week said mme				107.38588994018554
i am pleased with one place and stay there i get tired of it and leave it i am free as a bird and have wings like one my attendants obey my slightest wish				1388.7155429845752
these three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting snugly into his pocket				1300.6252824024273
is there a secret spring said valentine				164.1243810343971
now as you are one of the whole world i mean to say that you also are deserting me cardinal heavens				3771.620427697566
well within a week i am to deposit four millions for my share the four millions i promise you will produce ten or twelve but during my visit to you the day before yesterday sir which you appear to recollect so well replied eugénie i saw you arranging a deposit is not that the term of five millions and a half you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like lightning yes but those five millions and a half are not mine and are only a proof of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular banker has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five millions and a half belong to them at any other time i should not have hesitated to make use of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken				183059.77467405156
on the contrary that simplifies the matter greatly				10459.642309645531
here s one your honor how the devil hast thou two horses asked d artagnan jumping on one of them				99.22430777301628
ah madame said comminges hastening to d artagnan here is one who can tell you better than myself for he was my protector				19551.3996175408
you might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but today you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your word i will keep it returned morcerf but i fear that you will be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic horizons				255488.21161600488
here was another frondeuse to persuade and she was even less open to conviction than her younger rival				9403.0591753338
a terrible vision the cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript his cheek upon his hand and looked intently at the young man for a moment				529.2745329830781
a poor officer without fortune without protection without a future unless the eye of my queen which i have sought so long rests on me for a moment				536.858294802223
oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another idea took possession of his mind so used to misfortune that it was scarcely capable of hope the idea that the noise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon				4699.2815267447195
now barring all that i mean to say she is a deuced fine girl handsome certainly replied albert but not to my taste which i confess inclines to something softer gentler and more feminine ah well exclaimed château renaud who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend you young people are never satisfied why what would you have more				1059.984050203047
so then he no more knew where aramis was than where athos and porthos were and the affair was becoming a matter of great perplexity when he fancied he heard a pane of glass break in his room window				443.3609365128628
now he is gone it is your turn to get out said mme				136.84977625315673
your advice then is to sell the diamond replied aramis				80.94224580634999
i have just made m de villefort promise to call on him and i hope the visit will be returned				749.0079656671348
coupé thirty five francs				1233.477643773775
why if you sought concealment did you call your horse vampa that was an oversight certainly replied the count but tell me does the count of morcerf never visit the opera				8773.20336831944
of all his friends athos was the eldest and the least resembling him in appearance in his tastes and sympathies				79326.78053826343
return to paris said he assemble the servants who remain there				774.86327614832
d avrigny accosted the priest				2809.284973775516
my brother had arrived the previous evening at nîmes and at the very door of the house where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated				6609.572031789022
if he comes to france will you accord him hospitality				27362.67555685169
yes sir and it was a fierce one his highness the prince charged eleven times in person he is a great commander bragelonne he is a hero sir				850.9283049693297
all night he was lulled by the melancholy noise of the surf				371219.1127429675
the queen				419.96910958823577
well asked the president what do you say to this letter general i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for louis xviii				1668.2634230288731
i shall always love you be sure of that				689.4586963629661
like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger i laid in my provisions i loaded my weapons i collected every means of attack and defence i inured my body to the most violent exercises my soul to the bitterest trials i taught my arm to slay my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles				181542.1964410065
what is he doing				2943.731971847216
the horses will have a long night s rest and at five o clock to morrow morning we can be again on the road olivain dared offer no opposition to this determination but he followed his master grumbling				226211.4680645145
d artagnan then returned home in thoughtful mood finding a somewhat lively pleasure in carrying mazarin s bag of money and thinking of that fine diamond which he had once called his own and which he had seen on the minister s finger that night				873.3833958830965
the result was that the proud look entirely failed of its purpose				1455.0727303569872
this wine will give you strength drink and she put the glass to the lips of the young woman who drank mechanically				24155.653043351536
then it grew nearer and it seemed to her almost at the same time that she heard the neighing of horses				974.0504030766543
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at auteuil and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on the day of valentine s death				694.6773509317361
you were seated upon cushions in the spanish fashion you wore a robe of green satin embroidered with gold and silver hanging sleeves knotted upon your beautiful arms those lovely arms with large diamonds				6704.936513147302

baptistin looked at his master who made a sign to him and he went out closing the door after him				33.79239499082772
he could not understand how albert s fiery nature of which he had seen so much among the roman bandits had suddenly stooped to this humiliation				23234.075326311544
which means that i have just been duped sixty louis for a horse which by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour d artagnan and athos laughed aloud				7405.84359782408
porthos came up behind and unhooking the lamp on the staircase relit that in the room				202.2369714781337
what is it you want dear grandpapa said valentine and she endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to need and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind she repeated them aloud then finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a constant no she said come since this plan does not answer i will have recourse to another she then recited all the letters of the alphabet from a down to n when she arrived at that letter the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing he wanted				18034.384716657663
this supposition appeared to her most reasonable				30353.244202606482

when the count arrived he had under his touch his books and arms his eyes rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the house awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the houses we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a part of our souls				99359.06389427834
dantès remained in his cell all day not daring to return to his friend thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced once for all that the abbé was mad such a conviction would be so terrible				6081.989135562016

only we conspire against the rochellais ah you gentlemen of policy replied the cardinal knitting his brow in his turn the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found in your brains if we could read them as you read that letter which you concealed as soon as you saw me coming the color mounted to the face of athos and he made a step toward his eminence				1894.936871042968
and you monsieur du vallon yes you sir				400.1494003956745
they never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy cannon ball to the feet and then threw them into the sea				620.52673818398
who is there answered the voice of her he sought				15937.357576211962
they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the house				514.2171980548376
he therefore informed m morrel of his wish to quit the sea and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant into whose service he entered at the end of march that is ten or twelve days after napoleon s return				1675.2257204615255

d artagnan lost no time in useless compliments				4998.034063299925
but i thought you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and wills in the manner i have described				39418.150387174595
athos began to despair				959.9144608839762
the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the walls of a prison				1228.1492089987137
he soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the hackney coach then the coachman s voice and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the windows				1422.8219029798904
we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the door and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared				592.5055934671001
if it be to avenge her i am ready to follow you athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis to go and fetch the superior				3448.8193672797584
so that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st germain				3207.921706317642
numberless groups paraded the streets and whatever d artagnan might think of it it was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their usual forbearance in order to assume a warlike aspect				38062.24012436946
at the top of the stairs he found planchet in a great fright				5297.18163457179
and morrel was right for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal				47148.78767984049

the poor girl pale as death and trembling in all her limbs wished to delay her lover but milady with her ear on the watch had heard the noise d artagnan had made and opening the door said come in all this was of such incredible immodesty of such monstrous effrontery that d artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard				714.7008961535005
if anyone comes call me i will lieutenant said the soldier				5172.711144152729

these were pistols of an especial pattern which monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room				195.59706776463642
d artagnan recognized the cardinal				269.0351276383195
the general s carriage was ready but the president told him it was impossible for him to use it since it was useless to blindfold the master if the coachman knew through what streets he went				2716.850189897619
d artagnan needs to be alone to weep and to sleep				795.5314574424132

i have the honor i presume of addressing m de monte cristo the count bowed				1333.7302274444642
his calm and serene look formed a singular contrast to albert s grief stricken face who approached also followed by the other four young men				1200.1317193974253
ah indeed said d avrigny struck with a sudden thought has it occurred to you noirtier did not let him finish				68621.16911273269

in less than five minutes he arrived at the end of the cord				21745.427299925042

monte cristo examined him with the same look that at rome he had bent upon the execution of andrea and then in a tone that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward the abbé busoni then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in he sent you to me with a letter of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities				5370.203806233368

she also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon d artagnan when he spared the life of her brother				2033.9701940422574
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own his life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her				191.9162535199186

lips of stone turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to franz yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug love was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty lips and he was held in cool serpent like embraces				134177.53604623472
you leaned upon my arm upon this madame				648.2302939316995

adieu sir said the magistrate who had risen from his seat i leave you bearing a remembrance of you a remembrance of esteem which i hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for i am not a man to bore my friends as you will learn				159846.59185626567
to you the only just good and compassionate being i have met with				5480.944016662915
as we used to say when we said good bye to each other in the late cardinal s time athos waved his hand raoul bowed and d artagnan and planchet set out				502.878383296221
when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you yes since you have known me said morrel smiling but that can not apply to the time previous to our acquaintance valentine you are very provoking and will not give me credit for anything but let me hear this second proof which you yourself own to be absurd well look through this opening and you will see the beautiful new horse which i rode here ah				518.8508581345184

bonacieux and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was going or upon the person who should accompany her d artagnan would have returned home since he had so promised				24427.366440488782
but instead of going to her own room valentine having once gained her liberty entered the gallery and opening a small door at the end of it found herself at once in the garden				2357.673131566275
and what has happened to you my dear porthos continued d artagnan				25.65575477832133
how happy you are in being exempt from all this well and why should not you be free too				3617.6387491185715
heyday cried d artagnan drawing his sword and taking refuge behind his horse are you not mistaken				1828.8369708229595
then the vessel resumed its course still escorted by the little cutter which sailed side by side with it menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon				12361.738468365253
take the stairs on your right go up the first flight and knock at number one				752.7290887100107
as for me i play my game squarely fairly and above board as i always do				1304.1558256179148
the hôtel then is far away at the other end of the town very well said milady and she resolutely entered the carriage				536.0315594671885
d artagnan leaned upon the neck of his horse in order that he might see without being seen				1790.1541126426973
do you know monsieur d artagnan lieutenant in the king s musketeers said the voice you are monsieur d artagnan i am then you came here to defend him him				28.25716289168852

the englishmen were all men of rank consequently the odd names of their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise but of annoyance				145203.8391886272
now if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his abode he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs and finding nobody there but his other two companions perhaps they would not be able to conceive what all this meant				8082.407835024368
give us a light said the other bearer or i shall never find what i am looking for the man with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms				49544.19150301459
he ordered two horses to be saddled and himself went as guide to the young guardsman				170218.46030394672
but alas i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security i trust we shall never find it so in our experience oh cried morrel almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before noirtier and valentine and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness until that time continued the young girl in a calm and self possessed tone of voice we will conform to circumstances and be guided by the wishes of our friends so long as those wishes do not tend finally to separate us in a word and i repeat it because it expresses all i wish to convey we will wait and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes sir said morrel not only with resignation but with cheerfulness therefore continued valentine looking playfully at maximilian no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your name morrel looked obedience to her commands				248992.61785334352
does he think we are going to take him in				851.2411989972248
aramis he continued was intimate with a young needlewoman from tours a cousin of his named marie michon ah i knew her cried the duchess				9198.360217739177

nothing replied maximilian				3208.6988658260393
at eight o clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for the expedition				26949.839894861932
at the hour appointed lord de winter and the four friends repaired to the convent the bells tolled the chapel was open the grating of the choir was closed				3005.444085617809

he held in his hand a tankard full of a dark substance and approaching the gleam of light shed by the lamp he uttered this single monosyllable oh with such an expression of extreme terror that mousqueton started alarmed and blaisois was near fainting from fright				4971.645151063577
now he added rising in the stirrups and looking about him which i wonder is the lightning at this moment as if in reply to his words a man lying on a coil of cables rose and advanced a few steps toward him				38.293507359456775
i respected your father very much said he				11.012869471175911
it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless				2345.0359677661604
we will grow old together and talk of our companions no replied d artagnan deuce take it the campaign is going to begin i wish to be there i expect to get something by it what do you expect to get why i expect to be made marechal of france ha				25674.206049084638
porthos seeing this retwisted his mustache elongated his imperial a second time and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir and who not only was a beautiful lady but still further no doubt a great lady for she had behind her a negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the mass				7507.855121825175
well i can weather the storm i whom notwithstanding you tax with fear not with bravado that is not my way but i am firm				3879.342884676052
one day he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel there shall not be one a minute longer than you please said dantès who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations				206834.37154480407
monsieur replied the count with a chilling air i am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good fortune which occurred to me monsieur might have enabled you to dispense with a duty which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great honor for i am aware that m de villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me a favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness villefort astonished at this reply which he by no means expected started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in the tablets of his brain that the count of monte cristo was by no means a highly bred gentleman				840.4129636896556

it is useless to let the cardinal know yes sire you understand tréville an edict is still an edict it is forbidden to fight after all but this encounter sire is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a duel				3015.492598471912
i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said monte cristo did i not possess a moral distrust of my best friends and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a part quite out of my line and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly however your excellency said andrea in consideration of lord wilmore by whom i was recommended to you yes certainly interrupted monte cristo but lord wilmore did not omit to inform me my dear m andrea that the season of your youth was rather a stormy one				756.5826922494654
the town is in open revolt and just now as i was crossing the rue montorgueil with monsieur du vallon who is here and is your humble servant they wanted in spite of my uniform or perhaps because of my uniform to make us cry long live broussel and must i tell you my lord what they wished us to cry as well speak speak down with mazarin i faith the treasonable word is out mazarin smiled but became very pale				762.7748409052706

you do not know her replied the stranger				1779.4070893798353
come said monte cristo touching his shoulder with his finger are you a man again maximilian yes for i begin to suffer again the count frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation				13041.278834701096

this was the last blow to the prisoner				1243.0784261608335
a few moments after the little door was opened and a man entered				757.7398336371276

barrois asked mademoiselle valentine noirtier nodded his head				326.56252319750894
athos replied always by gestures that that was well and indicated to grimaud by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster that he was to stand as sentinel				1640.1446695566979
monsieur porthos what do you say to that i say it is easy enough answered porthos				86.54563972781735

oh he cried in an accent of despair the count has deceived me i am yet living and extending his hand towards the table he seized a knife				5224.514596056318
you ll see that that queer fellow will be a sheriff before i shall be a captain come dear d artagnan look up a little				995.271074480965

when they reached the side of this felucca mordaunt dexterous in his eagerness for vengeance seized a rope and climbed up the side of the vessel with a coolness and agility very rare among landsmen				123308.37130303505
porthos rose always ready for this kind of adventure				3207.126383663466
it is a little worse for the journey but that s no matter there are no horses albert looked at franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand				695.1124157014766
cucumetto fancied for a moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly but this mattered little to him now rita had been his and as for the money three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared little about it				95.4465202688445
you are right sir replied the governor and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject				1117.8123546677734
nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable poor count				309.03519840982665
ah devil take it you speak in earnest and must have a definite answer				834.0811978409287
when i am insulted i do not faint i avenge myself and she made a sign for kitty to leave the room				174.02048319189544
half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear but as i had only drunk half a glass of the water i contended longer and instead of falling entirely asleep i sank into a state of drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly				4491.6484519657515
he pushed the door open and entered				765.4123550499922
why said she you could plant one of the chestnut trees in the tuileries inside				6768.559483307684
a fresh practical joke now occurred to the duke				770.5196540864765

but instead of either of these he saw nothing but a strange face sunburnt and encircled by a beard with eyes brilliant as carbuncles and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf s or jackal s				886.4424334538105
saved exclaimed the man with gray hair who also touched bottom				13569.878970162832
the telegraph m and madame de villefort found on their return that the count of monte cristo who had come to visit them in their absence had been ushered into the drawing room and was still awaiting them there				807.1773705488888
to such a degree i assure you though i would not say so to others that if the queen acknowledging the injuries she has done me would recall my mother and give me the reversion of the admiralty which belonged to my father and was promised me at his death well				495.26898211011036
speak now the queen herself releases you from your promise the queen said d artagnan with an astonishment which this time was not pretended				194051.24858165983
here am i milady here am i cried kitty springing forward to meet her mistress				933.4062081605828

the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nîmes to paris who had hid himself in the garden who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the child he might become acquainted with your person nay he might even then have known it				89.33232932777292

well my friend fortune is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said				427.14872047942214
i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness				1614.2985508946065
well buckingham heard by some means no doubt of my return				1618.5547530273316
as for grimaud he seemed more sullen than ever				1723.5670671124194
but tell me what interest madame de villefort can have in your remaining unmarried did i not tell you just now that i was rich maximilian too rich				2105.2133367861793
and now that we are acquainted superficially at least with the masters and the valets let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of them				108.53805917706963
he had himself a daughter about her age but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to him from her mother having been consumptive				98692.52050351135
that would compromise the honor of the french army to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the costume of my calling what excessive nonsense you talk maximilian nonsense				14052.159827561363
he went up to him but to his extreme astonishment the stranger first addressed him				30.907225165509857
she seemed however by certain signs to recognize a door and approaching that door and now monsieur said she it is here i have business a thousand thanks for your honorable company which has saved me from all the dangers to which alone i was exposed				23726.26542587195
bonacieux dead and d artagnan in a swoon				12179.701288815391
in that hotel				2405.368912526934

the ancona road replied the baron				5504.0752792097965

life for life man for man give me one i will give you the other i don t know what you mean nor do i even desire to know what you mean replied the cardinal but i wish to please you and see nothing out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous a creature the more so as you tell me this d artagnan is a libertine a duelist and a traitor an infamous scoundrel monseigneur a scoundrel give me paper a quill and some ink then said the cardinal				260.5543234225514
there it lay stretching out into one interminable line of dust and sand with its sides bordered by tall meagre trees altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance that no one in his senses could have imagined that any traveller at liberty to regulate his hours for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara				239193.21416067152
with the first dawn of day the jailer returned with orders to leave dantès where he was				1851.5580079387182
the count withdrew his foot				1394.5869877490877
a carriage awaited him at the door he got in followed by two soldiers and the magistrate and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles				2543.5978135235205
and to what penalty do you think the king will be condemned asked athos				75.44308741515339
porthos replied that he asked no better if the stranger in his turn would drink the health of the king				553.2416824090918
your milady said he appears to be an infamous creature but not the less you have done wrong to deceive her				200.15094137756805
he had been contented for the convenience of the house to lodge in the fourth story and truth obliges us even to confess that his chamber was just above the gutter and below the roof				8573.781778131126
gentlemen said athos she is alone within half a league of us in the direction of the river that s well said d artagnan				89.58037446374132
during this time valentine at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own room in order to recover her composure				32871.86833556822
he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains his opinion of me is altered for the better then no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings he is a charming young man said monte cristo and i felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine				1924.608915861837
this athos then was a very extraordinary man				117.23664378135962
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the united states				2357.0346575768212
when i ask you if you are consoled i speak to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets				10233.318133147519
do you understand now said the captain why no complaints are made to the government and why the vessel never reaches port it is probable that if gaetano had related this previous to proposing the expedition franz would have hesitated but now that they had started he thought it would be cowardly to draw back				674.1492841561081
the king is either a king or no king if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief unfortunately madame answered villefort the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it nay madame the law is frequently powerless to effect this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done oh m de villefort cried a beautiful young creature daughter to the comte de salvieux and the cherished friend of mademoiselle de saint méran do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles				2551.622744280403
yes sir replied julie with hesitation what is your pleasure				1212.4871903244325

i did not look on caderousse as a bad man and i thought him incapable of committing a crime or even a theft that did more honor to your heart than to your experience m bertuccio				1929.7412412499748
the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but napoleon returned a special levy was made and fernand was compelled to join				123388.95089845698
i then recollected you gave a breakfast this morning and here i am				2641.5768701798333
you knew him returned the inspector with a smile				543.7888870129658
lord de winter d artagnan athos porthos and aramis went out close behind her				203.11642851130756
they went out				402.8125269631797
he thought himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy				21342.451731923516
for what said the count				215.0098132359465
add these four to the nine others that would be thirteen days lost thirteen days during which so many important events might pass in london				3410.3367090774655
but all at once as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought the countenance of the cardinal till then gloomy cleared up by degrees and recovered perfect serenity				17452.341119369983
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like gates of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from i know not where and the quantities of letters from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a father s mind and make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents				287458.92472300184
he had gone to the rendezvous had encountered there the adversary indicated whose name he had never known had given him a pretty sword stroke on the arm then had gone toward aramis who at the same time came to meet him having already finished his affair				1281.926555218841
la ramee took his hand and laughed aloud				13255.659477605444
like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal gift she brought misfortune upon everything she touched				12481.835720824602
the dying man had signed a deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin				8852.922273657849
but let us wait a little and reflect				23919.491736161544
the gascon gave a last twirl to his mustache a last turn to his hair brushed from habit the brim of his hat with the sleeve of his doublet and went downstairs				9585.244790722312
d artagnan more surprised than ever at the tone and manners of the abbé d herblay which contrasted so strongly with those of the musketeer aramis remained staring with wide open eyes at the face of his friend				611.4425952655376
i wager that i uttered a thousand extravagances while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that embarrassed him				36.61509288557559
the sun was in its zenith and the spot chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor				109228.0773725212
the reason why i am now dissatisfied is that i have not a clear appreciation of the past				1130.2787411834474
on the contrary said athos it must be preserved carefully				9753.848219410987
the president rang the bell				3562.439071667122
yes why because in the first place they transfer from the vessel to their own boat whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew hand and foot they attach to everyone s neck a four and twenty pound ball a large hole is chopped in the vessel s bottom and then they leave her				206.25356932259794
the new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor				6576.750157325389
that fellow has a decidedly bad countenance said the count in a tone of disgust as he shut up his glass into its ivory case				3430.057219136589
now my lord do not forget if any harm happens to me on your account that i have a wife and four children rest assured put the gag in grimaud in a second la ramee was gagged and laid prostrate				25370.253035285295
happy beyond measure well i am desired by him to give you his compliments and to say that he is in good health d artagnan almost leaped with joy				1087.2744388720716
listen to me rather than add to my destruction rather than add to my ignominy if you have merited this shame madame if you have incurred this ignominy you must submit to it as an offering to god what do you say				1281.971790012868
in this case replied caderousse let s have some more wine				1879.0072887782837
close to the hedge the steps stopped				1516.3130997298763
we need not add that the goldsmith o reilly and his assistant were prohibited from going out under any pretext				153254.4087730165
ah said aramis but you forget the officer d artagnan grew pale with rage				1459.155408517942
we shall meet again master d artagnan continued the leader raising his voice				785.8636725748559
whilst mordaunt was making his way to cromwell s tent d artagnan and porthos had brought their prisoners to the house which had been assigned to them as their dwelling at newcastle				39107.21858251116
let us be on our guard oh				598.0260526496556
d artagnan returned to help porthos if porthos needed help but porthos for his part had done his work as conscientiously as d artagnan				67.31762648598095
on seeing the appointed signal groslow who had at first crept behind one of the cannons planted on that spot walked straight up to the gentlemen				1195.8308430762331
raoul seeing that he could not arrive in time to cross the ferry with the travelers halted to wait for olivain				42269.744899615114
gendarmes i am at your service				1549.9793026412378
you know he has estates porthos i should think so indeed				894.4938009294139
the old man s declaration that valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of madame de villefort she gradually approached the invalid and said then doubtless dear m noirtier you intend leaving your fortune to your grandson edward de villefort the winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred				12620.563790308448
if she objects to your marrying m d épinay she would be all the more likely to listen to any other proposition no maximilian it is not suitors to which madame de villefort objects it is marriage itself marriage				7535.622893193399
that mood lasted some time but now he s as gentle as a lamb and sings gascon songs which make one die of laughing and du vallon asked athos				168.38758685701166
did i know poor dear edmond				3192.1652983671734

the unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into the depth of the heart and thoughts				1113.6179577277044
tomorrow you will go				1737.4355802575856
this is not a corsican maquis but an english garden badly kept i own but still you must not calumniate it for that monsieur i implore you do not stay there i think you are going mad bertuccio said the count coldly				3457.0814755808588
i am older than your eminence although i possess not your wisdom				54984.59165928442
there was such irony in the words and in the bearing of aramis that the duke had great difficulty in bridling his anger but at a word from flamarens he restrained himself and contented himself with saying you promise sir that s agreed that i shall find you to morrow at charenton oh don t be afraid sir replied aramis and the two gentlemen shortly afterward left the louvre				3078.588717949219
remained alone and turning his eyes on his half opened horace muttered justum et tenacem propositi virum m de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king s authority				5212.470884559866

a gentleman who had just arrived by the route of dammartin was seated at the same table and was breakfasting				125565.93534476383

he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces				2529.97132889945
surely had not such been the case he would not have perished by so dreadful a death why he was not altogether forsaken continued caderousse for mercédès the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him but somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernand the very person added caderousse with a bitter smile that you named just now as being one of dantès faithful and attached friends and was he not so asked the abbé				436.99581996866317
morrel listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared				616.1418252640366

i have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy you are a brave youth d artagnan interrupted the cardinal tapping him familiarly on the shoulder charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature				3124.5713458153873
did you not say she was dead three times she attempted to kill me and i pardoned her but she murdered the woman i loved				5847.034228721479

but he does wrong to use his privilege				38271.75157270385
wrote in a hand as small as possible another note on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his own while he is only commenting upon the idea of another said go on my dear duke go on i listen sire said blacas who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing villefort to his own profit i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a serious minded man deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king and so i hastened to you sire mala ducis avi domum continued louis xviii still annotating				183042.4921287775

she corrupted this man she placed the poniard in his hand she made him kill the duke				794.1806415365678
so young cried felton covering that hand with his kisses				10765.372823335358
they soon tired of the sport				6177.041906592536
what you tell me is horrible sir				616.6761840040065
for fear that anyone should be observing her return she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her eyes around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join maximilian				497.6974731277388
but carlini would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of rita s father				919.882047772663
follow me replied d artagnan				7.417993732670879
proceed said he to the host				618.1399555785594
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that				688.2308878154112
planchet by way of dessert would have liked to hear the conversation but the citizen declared to d artagnan that what he had to say being important and confidential he desired to be left alone with him				28.462963772991237
when he had mounted his phaeton monte cristo turned and seeing bertuccio what news said he				361.3569865357466
there was therefore nothing for them to do but to follow the prudent advice of monsieur d arminges and beat a retreat				1641.4316990256002
the boat at this moment turned around and the dying man was by that turn brought nearer athos				182.59674807555848
present arms				544.2449253282824
after a moment i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the heart and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a doctor would have done i inflated the lungs by blowing air into them and at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it began to breathe and cried feebly				252116.0959190119
but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation				83308.19798215116
i thank you d artagnan you are more impetuous than you were returned d artagnan				69.3973783301205
examine the past and the present and endeavor to dive into futurity and then say whether i am not a divine instrument				117652.24452803387
d artagnan therefore returned to the rue férou				22107.27700111657
monsieur d artagnan never made such an answer as that when the service of your majesty was concerned said athos bowing with great dignity				10390.108667016155
clemency is a royal virtue employ it and you will find that you derive advantage therein thereupon the cardinal hearing the clock strike eleven bowed low asking permission of the king to retire and supplicating him to come to a good understanding with the queen				386.38077578791757
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence				2222.9240137627467
monsieur d artagnan made a compact with you and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested your wife and has placed her beyond reach m				739.1125083090301
her face as she looked at athos had taken on an expression that can not be described				38516.194797764736
yes my friend and now now what asked porthos				20.63295516048985
whoever did it writes well				554.3914877380648

it is true then he said rather uttering his thoughts aloud than addressing his companion it is true then that all our actions leave their traces some sad others bright on our paths it is true that every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands it leaves its track				225490.34894745372
everyone drew back and the man in the red cloak remained standing alone in the middle of the room				201.9837013791479
in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse who was discovered in some distant country and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the fact of his wife s having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt				10667.272862422742
many citizens seeing the women flying toward the high street leaving their children crying at the open doors hastened to don the cuirass and supporting their somewhat uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan directed their steps toward the hostelry of the jolly miller before which was gathered increasing every minute a compact group vociferous and full of curiosity				3547.0989296405824
as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the cardinal kitty knew nothing about it but this time d artagnan was better informed than she was				1878.5763715789801
let us rest here an instant to give these poor creatures breathing time said porthos				110.33442781903383
come hither and let us talk the host approached with hesitation				11818.443642008875
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with mercédès and his father whereas he was now confined in the château d if that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his father and mercédès and all this because he had trusted to villefort s promise				2185.03334394035
to the sheets said he				7.7191943004411625
what must the mistrustful restless suspicious cardinal think of her silence the cardinal not merely her only support her only prop her only protector at present but still further the principal instrument of her future fortune and vengeance				2807.8881481173444
we have secured him yes said aramis through an infamous act of treason porthos pressed his friend s hand and said to him yes sir all is fair in war stratagem as well as force look yonder at this instant the squadron that ought to have protected charles s retreat was advancing to meet the english regiments				249025.86417377248
this letter is here in this pocket and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter				619.7265756298261
when you leave this you will behold my men at work				1525.2652826678861
he is cold said debray				1114.2245413399235
he felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of iron than he had ever felt for anything				2443.9062926316724
valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear eugénie				2540.0744082619035

try and make an effort to do so my good man said d avrigny				3045.9912163391214
instantly a mask wearing the well known costume of a peasant woman snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance				4589.564825023272
and if i do not possess that talent which your smiles prove to me you doubt should i not still have that ardent love of independence which will be a substitute for wealth and which in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self preservation				24412.95062542824
morrel advanced with a firm manly tread and poor barrois followed him as he best might				5059.481849603057
julie had scarcely recovered from her deep emotion when she rushed out of the room descended to the next floor ran into the drawing room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the allées de meilhan				10690.920984182982
there are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand				17192.011833697838
let us go you mean no my friend said athos you must leave us leave you cried d artagnan quite bewildered at this unexpected announcement				38100.88184171692
the repast had been ordered by athos and the lackey furnished by porthos				218.60493676844223
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat				1525.0107478015088
he was very much inclined to do so the contemptible fellow				1465.57902738337
i came to pray over the body of your daughter and now why are you here i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this moment i will pray to god to forgive you as i do good heavens exclaimed villefort stepping back fearfully surely that is not the voice of the abbé busoni no the abbé threw off his wig shook his head and his hair no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly face				637.2420104383641
i am neither an angel nor a demon i am a daughter of earth i am a sister of thy faith that is all yes yes said felton i doubted but now i believe you believe and still you are an accomplice of that child of belial who is called lord de winter				677.6157837704578
the day passed away as rapidly as an hour				1334.792087411797

sir said athos turning to comminges and giving him politely his sword by the hilt here is my sword have the kindness to keep it safely for me until i quit my prison				1242.2441199175494
athos forced his way through and entered followed by the young man				136.90531957651964
i am at least fearful of it				105.36943573064052

if you have it use it replied gondy				10694.255483851282
for fear the letter might be some day lost or stolen he compelled dantès to learn it by heart and dantès knew it from the first to the last word				499.1957933304785
oh faria faria how well did you judge men and things what did you please to say sir asked caderousse				505.87121432639873

d artagnan went to take leave of m de tréville				1467.6924518934875
it was for this reason as he said to those around him that he had put on his cloak and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his mustache disdainfully all admired his embroidered baldric and d artagnan more than anyone				2117.61305324551
his mind was torn by doubt grief and despair				1034.613236535219
madame replied de winter provided i can find some of my good old friends of former times i will answer for anything come then my lord said the queen with the painful doubt that is felt by those who have suffered much come and may heaven hear you chapter xxxvii				190716.00690834163

yes you				37.25912179585271
he showed the more respect to this queen deprived of every mark of pomp and stripped of followers as he felt some self reproach for his own want of heart and his avarice				52021.6890644349
look my lord cardinal said aramis would it not have been a pity to have separated men who love each other as we love				923.9646742402175
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps crime remember answered the abbé calmly as he replaced the jewel and its case in the pocket of his cassock it is your fault not mine that i do so				408.2524132360782
come sweep away all that for me				89.7920646897213
d artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the curtain and in the very first man who entered he recognized planchet				844.7658161047783
and did the eccentric person commit any new originality can he be seen without doing so				462.64213595321934
he has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him and when he returned took nothing but a glass of lemonade ah said madame de villefort why did he not take wine				2072.316115809578

he had stopped a moment in the passage to listen at a door and maximilian and emmanuel who had considerately passed forward a few steps thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a sob from within				2397.682761185728
bazin obeyed fastened to the end of a cord the three articles designated and let them down to planchet who then went satisfied to his shed				13437.518602461405

as you said we have acquired glory and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us for with the help of god we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists that evening d artagnan went to present his respects to m dessessart and inform him of his promotion				18099.479469549457
come come said d artagnan more reason why we should start on our journey				2366.9324050452633

d artagnan received him as he would have done a friend of twenty years standing				12518.934767843395
that has weakened my purse and i said aramis imagined that i had given almost my last sou to the church of montdidier and the jesuits of amiens with whom i had made engagements which i ought to have kept				16856.883714550753
although the young man was brave as we know he was terrified at that wild countenance those terribly dilated pupils those pale cheeks and those bleeding lips				442.0167133611028
edmond felt that the moment had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins				8636.091997217913

how many shots a hundred that s quite as many as we shall want				4689.351878760667

when the landlady made her appearance she expressed much astonishment at seeing planchet				627.4737823628883

on arriving there with an air as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was to follow				8763.628635229581
monsieur mordaunt he said since after running after one another so long chance has at last brought us together let us have a little conversation if you please chapter lxix				92594.02031707652
danglars astonished opened the door but a strong hand pushed him back and the carriage rolled on				1235.7005666720115
no said bonacieux but yesterday i went to st mandé to make some inquiries after a servant as i can not possibly do without one and the roads were so bad that i brought back all this mud which i have not yet had time to remove the place named by bonacieux as that which had been the object of his journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions d artagnan had conceived				133903.46651324726
a last but final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this interview and therefore he had suggested it				87.93779891455374

we have said that at half past twelve o clock madame danglars had ordered her horses and had left home in the carriage				542.2141166484847

danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for				1387.8284902392481
it was necessary that d artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber				536.4938831042123
he even told me he had not the slightest doubt that my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my property				9905.493336523768
but i am not selfish and i thought it might console you all a little to have a share in the matter				1382.1924357326839
oh he never was a friend of mine i did not know him and i had nothing to ask of him do you not know what became of him and the share he had in edmond s misfortunes no i only know that some time after edmond s arrest he married mademoiselle de saint méran and soon after left marseilles no doubt he has been as lucky as the rest no doubt he is as rich as danglars as high in station as fernand				2188.5432124497474
i wrote the word finis at the end of the sixty eighth strip about a week ago				3370.4122209040834

ah dantès my friend you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship pharaon then turning towards edmond who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried				1563.0181331923063
behind him pale indeed but marching with a firm step was charles stuart who advanced between two priests followed by a few superior officers appointed to preside at the execution and attended by two files of partisans who took their places on opposite sides of the scaffold				6557.7731932999
what need he add to such a desperate proof in figures				38599.74016581166
what should you say if either of these two friends proposed to you to let mazarin go why i should say that we had too much trouble in taking him to let him off so easily bravo porthos				188.24087577573883
they waited for ten minutes during which time no noise was heard that might indicate that grimaud was discovered and at the expiration of that anxious interval the two men returned closed the door after them and repeating their orders that the servants should go to bed and extinguish their lights disappeared				603.3585297158257

the jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the fire la carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her guest and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading a napkin at the end of the table and placing on it the slender remains of their dinner to which she added three or four fresh laid eggs				106709.51414784319

at this moment the door of the guardhouse was opened and one of the soldiers was summoned away				1040.8113306271457
we were then convinced my friend and i that there was some error of which we were the victims and that an explanation was called for between his eminence and ourselves				1460.721752536445
why did you give him six pistoles you told me to give them to him it is true i am too good natured				156034.33883587786
athos without saying anything emptied his pockets got together all his jewels purses aiguillettes and gold chains and offered them all to porthos but as to the sword he said it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should himself quit his lodgings				146926.52516382665
but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses my dear love pray do not say any more about them and i promise you another pair exactly like them in appearance only more quiet and steady the baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt while her husband affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards monte cristo and said upon my word count i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner				21730.23161707113
as he was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy d artagnan and aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him				34.597965175462946

during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror starred in every direction				3259.1725726221393
capital cried the gascon you would make a distinguished general and do you think asked groslow that stuart will ever escape while i am on guard no to be sure replied d artagnan unless forsooth the sky rains friends upon him groslow s face brightened				31810.01781540591
should you not have known me again in spite of my eight and forty years of age on the contrary i do not find you the same person at all i understand cried athos with a gentle blush				22588.71246815089
it is useless then to attempt anything with him				29.869223963591168
well for my part i shall go to bed said d artagnan come porthos porthos followed the lieutenant with that profound confidence he ever had in the wisdom of his friend				585.9373158587541
when the three persons he expected had entered he looked at the door which his valet immediately closed				3048.7230312047213

he was my friend he had no secrets from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me and he told you nothing not a word nothing that would lead you to suppose nothing and yet you spoke of him at once ah in such a case one supposes sister sister said maximilian coming to the count s aid monsieur is quite right				882.6859499696262
so much the better to that exclamation of porthos s succeeded a groaning low and profound which seemed to come from behind a door				176.86579014753974
caderousse s hands still grasped the gold and bank notes and la carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance of their guest				9113.974749981902
five minutes afterwards the doors of the drawing room were thrown open and bertuccio appearing said with a violent effort the dinner waits the count of monte cristo offered his arm to madame de villefort				292.5258691795405
and now farewell farewell saintly martyred majesty lisped athos chilled with terror				1203.6993762920208
she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good bye to you in full dress noirtier again closed his left eye				3500.522140789724
everybody noticed that the king looked dull and preoccupied				14780.594309105376
he was very pale				812.0423841355685
their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one				774.1593603277465
if we release the prisoner thus we shall never know the truth athos may always be found replied tréville ready to answer when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him				29.694826915449084
the ballet of la merlaison on the morrow nothing was talked of in paris but the ball which the aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen and in which their majesties were to dance the famous la merlaison the favorite ballet of the king				570.6695615791367
the two men in black rose bowed to aramis and d artagnan and advanced toward the door				188.84332115254728
cloud and who had reasons for not being seen and yet d artagnan did not for an instant doubt that it was mme				205.82128575487565
i can not return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses more especially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the count of monte cristo and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me one of those curiously interesting problems i for one delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your horses				981.5851248698882
the thing is clear as day said he and you must have had a very confiding nature as well as a good heart not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair do you really think so				387.00696411159856
ah said he to debray who had thrown himself into an easy chair at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his right hand and an account book in his left what are you doing there				802.7678179564715
as he was about to pass the wind blew out porthos s long cloak and d artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it				91.10402552518937
the first person that struck him on his entrance was aramis planted near a great chair on castors very large covered with a canopy of tapestry under which there moved enveloped in a quilt of brocade a little face youngish very merry somewhat pallid whilst its eyes never ceased to express a sentiment at once lively intellectual and amiable				110657.68290252896
the queen appeared to be impatiently expecting them for at the first slight noise she heard in the hall leading to her room she came herself to the door to receive these courtiers in the corridors of misfortune				2007.6393747866337
but what asked the groom				12303.085949369246
my mother cried mordaunt with eyes on fire with a look of hate impossible to paint i can only offer thee one victim but it shall at any rate be the one thou wouldst thyself have chosen and whilst d artagnan uttered a cry porthos raised the oar and aramis sought a place to strike a frightful shake given to the boat precipitated athos into the sea whilst mordaunt with a shout of triumph grasped the neck of his victim and in order to paralyze his movements twined arms and legs around the musketeer				982.6645876679129
cries of down with mazarin death to the cardinal resounded on all sides				4123.274091456525
my apartment will be close to his				1357.3677323182837
hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken on the wheel				145052.5624960859
you are insane monsieur monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting and d artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper which athos had forced from milady and which he had given to d artagnan to serve him as a safeguard				144661.0563505981
well replied la ramee your supper is ordered ah				433.0070680058868
would not m noirtier also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the poison oh heaven said valentine is this the reason why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last month and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel oh yes yes then that explains all said monte cristo				339.8507224994091
he shuddered and rubbed his eyes as though awaking from a dream				1423.9764219859733
yes said dantès do you know him no replied villefort a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators it is a conspiracy then asked dantès who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm				4303.236315664679
yes i received the news this evening by a courier				27409.4779227015
instead of raising it thought he they have lowered it				80.95602584776829
at first sight nothing denoted the cardinal and it was impossible for those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were				6358.879490172188
this pretended d artagnan was he not an emissary of the cardinal whom the cardinal sought to introduce into tréville s house to place near him to win his confidence and afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances				127195.90961773525
can all this force be summoned on my account thought he				260.04406491741474
so much the better but what has de rochefort to do with this manner you have of invading my room ah sir				802.5902232642204
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some days to get married yes first and then to go to paris very good have what time you require dantès				518.5748249630994
the terrible office he had held for twenty five years had succeeded in making him more or less than man				151.28926239273585
but let us first settle the question as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of the pharaon				4634.803255568592
villefort knew not when he should return and renée far from pleading for dantès hated the man whose crime separated her from her lover				2873.946271873358
planchet the most intelligent of the four was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon which the four friends had fired and which was accompanied as may be remembered by rochefort s servant				1708.5077154462945
d artagnan no longer doubted that this was porthos s pleasant dwelling place				582.3519362482534
one evening i went according to custom to a house which i frequented with much pleasure when one is young what can be expected one is weak				23988.664498207174
well cried the three musketeers all together on seeing d artagnan enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset with anger				4128.255339831002
in which the plot thickens his visit to m de tréville being paid the pensive d artagnan took the longest way homeward				222502.70761276997
the same evening when the flock was safe at the farm the little luigi hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a sort of stylus				103131.31852794037
you have ill understood wrongly interpreted i did not mean to say silence silence cried the duke				602.013577342334
the four friends appeared to be entire strangers to one another and indifferent to the precautions taken for guarding the king				549.373099552341
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me asked the enraptured villefort				349.77806418017497
another way of getting hanged so you refuse my request to be sure i do furiously the pretty landlady was desolate				87901.08257637723
what the count said was true the most curious spectacle in life is that of death				707.1447815279987
why you told me he was a young man				135.07464104510788
as d artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel no difficulty was made in complying with his request and a servant went to inform m de tréville that his young compatriot having something important to communicate solicited a private audience				4278.6833136493
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back				697.4827081238794
he alone could have transmitted to lord de winter all these frightful secrets which he has discovered one after another by a train of fatalities				120361.56567670779
a loan nothing more				886.2019562133594
but you are not the king my son and can never be so while they are alive				5313.437916397362
what on earth can you have been saying to that bulldog exclaimed porthos				61.83480658202714
we are first said morrel looking out of the window				464.9170741699772
franz himself however saw his way more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the light which served in some manner as a guide				149908.57333630102
you have a park and horses servants athos smiled				497.21594530292833
luigi took her arm beneath his own and led her to the door of the grotto				3431.1859541416943
the misfortune is great but i think you have still a good number of falcons sparrow hawks and tiercels and not a man to instruct them				101.84248867443469
the door keeper was called				4171.014672016577
who knows said gondy such men are like thunderbolts one recognizes them only when they have struck every one shuddered and there was a moment of silence during which the queen pressed her hand to her side evidently to still the beatings of her heart				394.35462818788307
but i must not forget one grand point which that i have been singularly assisted nonsense i have indeed by circumstances no by you by me				87.80832441226856
i can not allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render				124296.23328653073
ali appeared				1186.8530108968012
you are convinced now edmond are you not asked the abbé				427.26422286931273
the diamond which glittered in the window at marlé s or fossin s shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the one that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure worldling murmured the count				303.496530323795
the three friends drew near and discovered a young man stretched on the ground bathed in a pool of blood				2173.6169034262784
that will be the first time i have done so for sixteen days and me too said d artagnan				30.80695066510003
i i was where d artagnan stands				3317.219116282107
the countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though franz tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single feature				43287.7036693404
coquenard understood it				63.41625343752227
he questioned her with his eyes but the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look				1755.1627855574607
athos replaced his in his belt porthos and aramis who held their drawn swords in their hands returned them to their scabbards				75715.44110547817
dear friend to an englishman interrupted athos well commenced				7500.097639609041
can tréville have set this gascon upon me				87.12254352325111
exactly my daughter that is precisely what i mean said danglars almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man ruined yes that is it ah said eugénie				1846.5473268443848
it is your new master my good fellow said the footman				40999.88493358461
no replied mousqueton parry kept it				78.49404831417628
yes my pocket has a hole in it oh yes monsieur raoul said mousqueton the letter was very consoling				195757.19984263383
of this treaty at least i have been warned				195678.61971214312
mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was brought to him announcing that the duke was free and that he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him				32.83438526020324
the pilot again changed the course of the boat which rapidly approached the island and was soon within fifty paces of it				96.95517814589977
i therefore maintain in spite of morcerf that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence perhaps you are right said morcerf meanwhile who is in the russian ambassador s box which box do you mean asked the countess				4285.805575258891
then the danger was so imminent the rioters came so near uttering such threats that the chancellor thought his last hour had come and confessed himself to his brother priest so as to be all ready to die in case he was discovered				112096.05705007543
he therefore shaped his course toward that place and dismounted at the dauphin d or				32618.452607033963
what a wrist you have reverend sir said caderousse stroking his arm all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what a wrist silence				509.1182565675309
i don t think so answered the other he s too stupid to imagine such a scheme				28241.573673561245
the brief space had however been sufficient for a man followed by a number of servants to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the door of the carriage to take from it a lady who was convulsively grasping the cushions with one hand while with the other she pressed to her bosom the young boy who had lost consciousness				12042.821339218945
peppino said the brigand chief give me the torch what are you going to do inquired the count				228.45195199166682
i think this is about your position is it not confound it yes replied danglars				444.27602059900113
i then was ready to dismount but it was too late i descended into the arms of the archers				32278.337019680857
but d artagnan is devoid of such weaknesses				32124.29811272272
here at least said athos pointing to the bastion they will not come and disturb us it appears to me said d artagnan with that prudence which allied itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council yes said aramis athos is right animadvertuntur in desertis a desert would not have been amiss said porthos but it behooved us to find it there is no desert where a bird can not pass over one s head where a fish can not leap out of the water where a rabbit can not come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal				275.97250650501394
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for d artagnan and grimaud obeyed as usual				3110.828911634661
bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man				140.5361973379148
do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their movements my father i will know who my father is said the obstinate youth i will perish if i must but i will know it				87.11170140549623
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that glass to have intruded on the solitude of a friend you can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction				4788.8234380472295
anne had enforced the utmost secrecy and had disclosed the event to no one except the prince de condé who had sent five or six hundred horsemen into the environs of saint germain with orders to bring in any suspicious person who was going away from rueil in whatsoever direction it might be				878.1795791091985
the only question was had she ten or twelve				5884.407531777757
bazin looked down and started as if he had seen a serpent				43782.13783375491
suddenly the jailer entered				604.7961692518461
these are melancholy doings your reverence which always fall again upon the poor				45778.78100354745
athos and aramis again questioned planchet but he had seen nothing of d artagnan they wished to take planchet with them but he could not leave his troop who at five o clock returned home saying that they were returning from the battle whereas they had never lost sight of the bronze equestrian statue of louis xiii				764.4876971901432
you are insupportable cried the duke i shall beat you grimaud bowed				1344.9980143354721
yes well read the letter again				238.3521401818515
two or three years perhaps so much the better cried porthos				74.79272572949887
athos and aramis have played a game with me which alarms me				68.66420429619578
valentine whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily no pity procureur the crime is fragrant				142026.0423433949
my ship is ready and had you not come i must have set off without you for general cromwell expects my return impatiently so thought the lieutenant tis to general cromwell that our dispatches are addressed have you no letter for him asked the young man				128.94948987994556
wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his eminence was so skillful in getting up				1317.1337247018578
on the king s service the musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the orders thus received				2224.4731735346295
the man at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture suddenly he struck against something crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the something rose uttering an exclamation of astonishment and monte cristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves				152897.47659996152
an hour had elapsed since her condemnation at that moment doubtless she was recalling all her crimes to her memory she was asking pardon for her sins perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous husband a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death				638.5804009200117

then replied mme				36.945396115544305
monte cristo observed it particularly and by a look asked the banker for an explanation				1433.3980915421985
nevertheless after several attempts at conversation with olivain he foresaw that many days passed thus would prove exceedingly dull and the count s agreeable voice his gentle and persuasive eloquence recurred to his mind at the various towns through which they journeyed and about which he had no longer any one to give him those interesting details which he would have drawn from athos the most amusing and the best informed of guides				4528.737968490236

la carconte then entered her chamber the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted				6190.7652205791
the count soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt				9724.674371397552
this can t last and he drew another twenty from his pocket				1311.3820007391985

i can imagine the effect i do not see the means i will find the means myself you are aware it will be war civil war furious devouring implacable oh				610.5283686931543
it was the same court of which raoul had so often heard the comte de la fere speak except that its aspect had much changed since the period when athos had himself been part of it therefore everything which the count de guiche related was new to his traveling companion				974.7798836787533
d artagnan felt his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful agility threw himself to one side				672.5131156255284

grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent				148483.32190777088
the king too who had listened in the greatest agony now breathed again				277.61784193216715
one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre who announced beauchamp				627.6198103261614
la ramee laughed also and the guards laughed in chorus grimaud however did not even smile				487.09835909439187
i have thought it no sin to bore through a wall or destroy a staircase but i can not so easily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life a slight movement of surprise escaped dantès				611.0362976976827
and therefore said d artagnan to clip the hope which athos s tacit adhesion had imparted to mazarin we shall not proceed to that violence save in the last extremity if on the contrary resumed mazarin you accept your liberty why you my lord might take it away from us in less than five minutes afterward and from my knowledge of you i believe you will so take it away from us no on the faith of a cardinal				284.24093327362755
that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded them				93.78461684552185
athos wished to restrain him but it was too late				1970.6396272391605
which i received this morning d artagnan opened it and as the day was beginning to decline he approached the window to read it				90.16688709874488
danglars began to look suspiciously at morcerf when someone came and whispered a few words to him				35.019735689157685
i am as sure now that the king will be saved as i am sure that i clasp the most loyal hand in the world aramis parted from athos went down from the scaffold in his turn and took his way to the hotel whistling the air of a song in praise of cromwell				3221.8134436039686
what art thou about				3948.1749786238743
oh if you know him tell me by a man of from forty to forty five years with black hair a dark complexion and a scar on his left temple that is he that is he but his name ah his name				778.8517359234589
meanwhile the guests seeing that the two friends were longing to be alone prepared to depart when a noise of dogs barking resounded through the courtyard and many persons said at the same moment ah				585.3006375753494
the heart of the young man overflowed with joy				1105.2531316544282
you will bind yourself cried the king by what monsieur de la trémouille shall say yes sire you will accept his judgment undoubtedly and you will submit to the reparation he may require certainly la chesnaye said the king				500.2816986770989
the man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he had left he made a sign with his head to the sentinel who turning to the boat said s accommodi the italian s accommodi is untranslatable it means at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the master it is like that turkish phrase of molière s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its utterance				40950.335417506394

from the queen replied the servant				1619.4332850309468
dantès was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh				578.2406433098313
he offered his hand to the baroness who descending took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to everyone but monte cristo				370.5337926254089
this lasted several minutes until the frightful overturn of reason was accomplished then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the stairs				1122.2141038752402
in passing through the gate the hilt of the lieutenant s sword was caught in the grating and he was obliged to pull off his cloak in doing so he showed the butt end of his pistols and a ray of the moon was reflected on the shining metal				34949.66630483476
you sustained me powerfully sir and i protest to you that to day i feel very lonely				32784.989714109186

what is his name said he				7.555787555448792
the two women looked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the apartment julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features				5330.664159848806
the captain of the musketeers was therefore admired feared and loved and this constitutes the zenith of human fortune				1174.0643532611518

several strokes resounded on the door this time milady really pushed him away from her				194.60451888188067
well sir resumed danglars after a brief silence i will endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what sum you propose to draw upon me why truly replied monte cristo determined not to lose an inch of the ground he had gained my reason for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much money i might need the banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand				189.18057974463977
adieu mademoiselle				179599.047603081
his own youth seemed to reappear bringing with it all those savoury remembrances which are like perfumes more than thoughts				1106.7239843315901
the fight was therefore prolonged for some seconds but at length d artagnan dropped his sword which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick				26150.964437613875
this is fine said porthos to himself i am prettily caught he passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves and stuck his teeth into the sticky pastry of mme				182.3556394390191

he made morrel wait in the antechamber although he had no one with him for the simple reason that the king s procureur always makes everyone wait and after passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers he ordered m morrel to be admitted				6556.278662440929
let us then take advantage of it then aloud well my dear la ramee				1492.9507752890975

why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of gaspard caderousse but tell me i pray what has become of poor edmond				1500.9152619929305
villefort was no longer the civilized man he was a tiger hurt unto death gnashing his teeth in his wound				3996.410473019073

the little light in the lodge had long been extinct				13305.307222835612
at length felton who had not yet looked at milady turned toward her				194.4040001918311

one of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st louis that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably ancient it is possible said morcerf my father has in his study a genealogical tree which will tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified d hozier and jaucourt				112077.1367928809

the same expression continued				4582.012053603307
d artagnan s ball took off his enemy s hat				2257.5768548657634
and i see you playing with the pommel of your sword as if you had a great inclination to break the holy father s head yes count it is a strange thing and one which might astonish you but i feel an indescribable horror at the sight of yonder man				131.11637418044612
i was uneasy about him why because you met him at my house just after his introduction into the world as they told me				81.96508731760501
dantès meanwhile went on his way				820.1755745282005

he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many emotions arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his bed and slept soundly				25201.500452089604
he entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask				3631.6038331006944
i have a very good cook and he is not to be my heir i have full and perfect confidence in him				34.962389223692135

as franz was about to take leave of m de villefort when shall i see you again said the latter				6602.944202279113

he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed				4942.519464192919
when the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries it became necessary whatever hesitation he might experience it became necessary i say to come to the conclusion of the affair that is to say to search the queen herself				1911.6804906744692
oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you will oblige me to tell you that i see debray leave here pocketing the whole of the livres you have handed over to him this year while he smiles to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discovered that is a roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he loses the baroness became enraged				92707.20755547547
the reason for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked franz somewhat incredulously				120334.02025302322
what am i the law				1717.311757022655
everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and severe face whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to disturb and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror				1184.6874555479462
he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make				2737.2501243614524
the balance would come to about that sum but keep it and we shall be quits count said danglars are you speaking seriously i never joke with bankers said monte cristo in a freezing manner which repelled impertinence and he turned to the door just as the valet de chambre announced m				588.5701007582683
the old man returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes and paced up and down his chamber the whole day and would not go to bed at all for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night and for myself i assure you i could not sleep either for the grief of the poor father gave me great uneasiness and every step he took went to my heart as really as if his foot had pressed against my breast				1363.4680762775233
one may be very comfortable in a convent and as soon as the siege of la rochelle is terminated i promise you on my part good cried athos good				1554.5884414014765

if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question i believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty but tell me dantès if you had command of the pharaon should you be glad to see danglars remain captain or mate m morrel i shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence that s right that s right dantès				606.2100617161127

d artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance and when he had finished said and madame bonacieux do you know who carried her off for i do not forget that i owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance ah said bonacieux they took good care not to tell me that and my wife on her part has sworn to me by all that s sacred that she does not know				895.7409840605054

well asked anne of austria when d artagnan reappeared what does it mean it means madame that the report has spread that the queen has left the palais royal carrying off the king and the people ask to have proof to the contrary or threaten to demolish the palais royal oh this time it is too much exclaimed the queen and i will prove to them i have not left d artagnan saw from the expression of the queen s face that she was about to issue some violent command				5051.863935728385
the door was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told m morrel and then ran on to mercédès				1675.257673161125
the count was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel				9201.316937685087

he uttered not a word nor shed a tear but a deadly pallor spread over his face he knelt down on the ground raised winter s head and unfastening the order of the saint esprit placed it on his own breast				1347.385292628733
one plan occurred to me continued albert franz likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in love with mademoiselle danglars but in spite of four letters written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it will not make me break my promise that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another one whom you would not marry yourself albert smiled				505.2516632709158
he had instructed porthos to profit by this opportunity to see the ceremony and porthos in full dress mounted his finest horse taking the part of supernumerary musketeer as d artagnan had so often done formerly				8382.801573265986
he however kept a good countenance holding his hat in his hand and awaiting the good pleasure of his eminence without too much assurance but also without too much humility				98268.66735948686

advanced a step and folded his arms over his chest as napoleon would have done				1473.901322545619
sit down and let us talk it over milady murmured athos				59.11501420297862
many women held their infants on their shoulders and thus the children had the best view				2518.0598718210313
well the abbé adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage				94200.54694753197

when this terrible chain of ideas presented itself valentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help				3393.508423508383
come said the captain we have done all in our power and m morrel will have nothing to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves				1503.5484535285066

the only sublime ideas in politics are those which bear fruit				2270.450643323401
when i tell you a thing sir said mordaunt you insult me by doubting it i cried d artagnan i doubt what you say				1174.4260639997044
speak if you please said mazarin				237.00980260085987
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked				8543.377995714343
bonacieux away and convey her to a place of safety and there if matters required make her a hostage				124436.42435050472
go on signor pastrini continued franz smiling at his friend s susceptibility				30483.408178655704
hereafter being able to ask for me at all hours and consequently to take advantage of all opportunities you will probably obtain that which you desire that is to say replied d artagnan that you will wait until i have proved myself worthy of it				85.77138379149753
let us see said athos				5.604607030172106
he and she the queen and the duke cried richelieu				2690.666964354914
help me gentlemen cried d artagnan we must break in this door it is the devil in person said aramis hastening forward				1277.9021695984861
do you wish to assassinate a man who in the eyes of heaven is a brother				1997.1964526307524
i have chosen a trade a trade				3575.6931681741153
decidedly this is a clever fellow murmured athos				16.664557499246023
cruel enough if i am guilty but what name can you give it what name will the lord give it if i am innocent i am a soldier madame and fulfill the orders i have received do you believe then that at the day of the last judgment god will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges				3710.817538344697
what is it asked villefort rushing from his room				182.44635495995303
she entered the apartment and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her eyes and with an elegance that redoubled the count s attention				1176.0282243986085
the cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of paper wrote some lines upon it whilst d artagnan stood imperturbable without showing either impatience or curiosity				3629.502177509988
well one day when she was hunting with her husband continued athos in a low voice and speaking very quickly she fell from her horse and fainted				1888.481898193353
yes said madame de villefort the door was towards the road before and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house from the road i remember yes madame said monte cristo but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my gate in four days said morrel it is extraordinary indeed said château renaud it seems quite miraculous to make a new house out of an old one for it was very old and dull too				3558.9516431548
the next morning he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter s absence				3716.3529813516298
to what do you allude monsieur said danglars as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general s words				679.2705207678416
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last those are kind and cheering words				709.9906686766067
he perceived then at a glance that this woman was young and beautiful and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from its being totally different from that of the southern countries in which d artagnan had hitherto resided				63441.99832656794
we are about to ascertain sire replied d artagnan as he rapidly left the room				151.54796217025967
save the queen cried mazarin to the coadjutor				1268.9137036124737
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch				2207.329532957721
this parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few words of general civility and ran downstairs				9148.049159767981
as for d artagnan he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the pomme de pin where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him				37.95250886261763
apropos she said as if to drive away thoughts that pursued her in spite of herself how is poor voiture do you know scarron what is monsieur voiture ill inquired a gentleman who had spoken to athos in the rue saint honore what is the matter with him he was acting but forgot to take the precaution to have a change of linen ready after the performance said the coadjutor so he took cold and is about to die is he then so ill dear voiture asked aramis half hidden by the window curtain				4566.8044078006715
my dear monsieur louvieres said the coadjutor believe me i am truly concerned for the misfortune which has happened to you is that true and do you speak seriously asked louvieres				15027.464510212449
one day when benedetto was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the country never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your excellency knows there are no thieves in corsica complained that he had lost a louis out of his purse we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his money but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement				73413.92173022738
i think not replied château renaud				897.6235803808321
this knife is the knife with which felton stabbed him				27.241417614511562
ah that said the prince i understand that language thoroughly and since he is italian i will myself continue the examination				9820.846993727753
if at this moment the sweet voice of renée had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair mercédès had entered and said in the name of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced husband his cold and trembling hands would have signed his release but no voice broke the stillness of the chamber and the door was opened only by villefort s valet who came to tell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness				25906.732297924336
he had received in the chest the bullet of d artagnan s first adversary				1728.9652663350196
i shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public and a sweet kiss in private full of this idea villefort s face became so joyous that when he turned to dantès the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also				1425.2555623310757
it is for me then to interrogate grimaud where is she asked athos				71.02032871618569
come then on another occasion you can be firm and strong but to day is not the proper time to day flatter and caress or you are only a common woman at the first words of this address d artagnan had seized porthos s arm which he pressed with gradually increasing force				3742.5835215996967
the queen fixed her eyes upon the carriage they had left and seeing that it was empty she said but where is madame de longueville ah yes where is my sister asked the prince				1311.1887924324988
the woman especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her countenance had become livid and her eyes resembled burning coals				111230.93168906892
that is not an answer replied athos				5.242651231505918
let them hold themselves in readiness to march to night				816.1159701508867
then he put out his hand and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore				6660.179215211342
all this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the end of september				7834.806690553865
then what asked monte cristo				165.88452029122308
listen cried he pity me help me				53.26443463372964
bonacieux what is it it is the uniform of the cardinal s guards				2126.5926181341924
ah said d artagnan				7.444859357570902
the reflections of the mercer were already made he cursed the instant when m laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter and particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as lady of the linen to her majesty				2093.01796270854
he walked straight up to him and placed a pistol to his throat				2370.0506359333963
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany but instead of that you come to paris how does that annoy you it does not on the contrary i think it will answer my purpose so said andrea you are speculating upon me what fine words he uses i warn you master caderousse that you are mistaken well well don t be angry my boy you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and misfortunes make us jealous				33726.74330325617
i will not have you left alone so long				2674.3696902983065
he believed this opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor it is not astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball for he is doubtless a musketeer apprentice d artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him and fixed his eyes intensely upon the guardsman who had just made this insolent speech				21252.251881845892
brute said danglars				229.018676809721
his misery was depicted in sinister lines on his countenance				684.9621848926685
on her side milady tried to encourage felton in his project but at the first words which issued from her mouth she plainly saw that the young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged				116841.92059807734
some carried arms others seemed to be taking aim and the remainder appeared merely to be sword in hand				200.89704223383677
the marines were removed				3016.709306355336
dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor and upon their return the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces				2551.035141725117
this beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole dantès had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it				86.28735696699627

nevertheless as the crossroads offered him a better chance than any other place of meeting somebody he stood still				6033.185595089042
his eye took in at a glance the plump cheerful countenance of the mistress of the place and he at once perceived there was no occasion for dissembling with her or of fearing anything from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy				137333.6607908437
the swiss became as purple as a peony				73896.06711253754
now i can not for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it there was nothing else left for franz to do but to take up his hat open the door of the box and offer the countess his arm				1243.6149770391132

nothing ambiguous if you please				8253.70408360572

to see this woman so beautiful fair as the brightest vision to see her by turns overcome with grief and threatening to resist at once the ascendancy of grief and beauty it was too much for a visionary it was too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic faith it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that burns by the hatred of men that devours				113178.94460410315

what strange means has he used to compass this blessed end valentine was on the point of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret which concerned others as well as her grandfather and she said at some future time i will tell you all about it but when will that be when i am your wife the conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to morrel that he was ready to accede to anything that valentine thought fit to propose and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day				462.0709014468182

now madame danglars feared eugénie s sagacity and the influence of mademoiselle d armilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous expression with which her daughter looked upon debray an expression which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother s amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that eugénie detested debray not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of men and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers				23484.602332844326
yes but i came to ask something more than to be your companion and what may that be inquired the bandits with astonishment				2265.13680185935

two shots were fired at once one by d artagnan the other by the adversary of porthos				212.1543572140969
cavalcanti being left alone turned to monte cristo				305.1124010701326
listen to me edmond saw there was no escape and placing the old man on his bed he seated himself on the stool beside him				36.006808582548835

he felt himself seized by the hair then he saw and heard nothing				698.0922712837473
he was eighteen only three years older than you are raoul when i saw him set to work pitted against tried men and did monsieur d artagnan come off the conqueror asked the young man with glistening eye				3330.7264142393806
friend the cardinal although such a genius could never have done that shall i take out any more of them asked porthos				180.33403251068154
i have the honor to inform your majesty continued m de tréville in the same tone that a party of procureurs commissaries and men of the police very estimable people but very inveterate as it appears against the uniform have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house to lead away through the open street and throw into fort l evêque all upon an order which they have refused to show me one of my or rather your musketeers sire of irreproachable conduct of an almost illustrious reputation and whom your majesty knows favorably monsieur athos athos said the king mechanically yes certainly i know that name let your majesty remember said tréville that monsieur athos is the musketeer who in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with had the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously				3914.622927378297
no madame they struck me always struck me				62.24832634861345
suddenly mousqueton uttered a cry of delight taking from beneath one of the benches a bottle of wine and on looking more closely in the same place he discovered a dozen similar bottles bread and a monster junk of salted beef				152620.6800974186
i knew nothing of this engagement of this love yet i her father forgive you for i see that your grief is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart				392.76230724823523
there still remains that of bernajoux but you must not be too confident as to the rest m de tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over for scarcely had the captain of the musketeers closed the door after him than his eminence said to the king now that we are at length by ourselves we will if your majesty pleases converse seriously				4009.7110357228585
what someone is talking in the street it is the voice of of my husband				857.6108060926173
the note indicated neither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine o clock				1021.7763631222078
alone in his usual room lighted by two candles the condemned monarch gazed sadly on the luxury of his past greatness just as at the last hour one sees the images of life more mildly brilliant than of yore				180708.2359090099
when this speech was arranged villefort turned to dantès				562.8437679641552
albert too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position				4188.653582849451
there was no one in the whole group in a bad humor except cardinal mazarin				481.1685170278572
the road is never very safe during fair time oh as to the robbers said joannes here is something for them and he drew from his pocket a pair of small pistols loaded to the muzzle				191502.62288905238
notwithstanding his youth master andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy				1118.0490381448653
the old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the notary he significantly winked his eye in token of dissent				167274.81556493408
yes a base coward murmured d artagnan but she she was very beautiful what she demanded the host				596.4978344563317
stop a minute answered caderousse we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity and it is as well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves with these words he went stealthily to the door which he closed and by way of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at night				866.5846062726881
unfortunately he is more nimble than his master so that for the sake of his master he puts us all under his feet and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for he takes all he wants without asking at all the fact is said d artagnan i have always observed a great degree of intelligence and devotedness in mousqueton that is possible monsieur but suppose i should happen to be brought in contact even four times a year with such intelligence and devotedness why i should be a ruined man no for porthos will pay you hum said the host in a doubtful tone				519.0310019644755
that is rather difficult but the merit in all things consists in the difficulty				6286.414793696959
well said aramis what think you about these two enemies whom it requires besides comminges s troop ten good soldiers to confront are they not as like as two drops of water to d artagnan and porthos we ll search paris all day long said athos and if we have no news this evening we will return to the road to picardy and i feel no doubt that thanks to d artagnan s ready invention we shall then find some clew which will solve our doubts yes let us search paris and especially inquire of planchet if he has yet heard from his former master that poor planchet				744.3502087928795
this was before his servant came				2057.652601743811
never had anne of austria appeared to him so beautiful amid balls fêtes or carousals as she appeared to him at this moment dressed in a simple robe of white satin and accompanied by donna estafania the only one of her spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of richelieu				2754.0947358567437
sir can you be a coward continued villefort with increasing excitement you who could count one by one the minutes of four death agonies				30668.80464869639
for three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds without mixing with the marseillaise population intermarrying and preserving their original customs and the costume of their mother country as they have preserved its language				4013.165557434158
the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand francs oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished woman				413.2538928234636
the quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition carmela alone objecting to it but the count of san felice besought his daughter so earnestly that she acceded				192383.64695065265
i have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in prayer				5621.155926100056
i am perhaps come too soon count said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night nor has anyone in my house				497.45593933476766
they reached the queen s apartments but were compelled to stop in the ante chamber since her majesty was at that moment giving audience to gentlemen bringing her news from england				896.0630923910153
you will not believe in him who requires but a prayer a word a tear and he will forgive				183971.59675999128
i say that he doesn t suit me at all said porthos and that i feel a strong itching to follow aramis s advice by no means my dear porthos that man is a messenger of general cromwell it would insure for us a poor reception i imagine should it be announced to him that we had twisted the neck of his confidant nevertheless said porthos i have always noticed that aramis gives good advice listen returned d artagnan when our embassy is finished well if it brings us back to france well well we shall see at that moment the two friends reached the hotel arms of england where they supped with hearty appetite and then at once proceeded to the port				8177.142598446205
at five o clock precisely the count arrived before the house at auteuil followed by ali				2357.5944370487173
see paragraph e below				2306.2930148334576
yes franz took them from barrois and casting a glance at the cover read to be given after my death to general durand who shall bequeath the packet to his son with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document well sir asked franz what do you wish me to do with this paper to preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the procureur				3108.8033032607414
they are aiming they are going to fire they have received orders to fire on the people if the people approach the palais royal exclaimed mazarin				486.6577165216632
if i am happy in an error do not have the cruelty to lift me from it				81.6592797462007
what granted me scarcely more				912.8344568497796
do you want anything d artagnan shook his head and set off at full speed				1671.0085285566104
madame replied valentine he has not even breakfasted				188127.9195893831
let us go repeated d artagnan				20.00254238123391

kill said she but spare the honor of the widow of ali it is not to me to whom you must address yourself said kourchid				82519.76767931858
he recalled to his mind the details of the first night and with a beating heart and a brain on fire he re entered the hôtel and flew toward kitty s chamber				555.5603719085248
then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive				22772.088195355656
this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the count s box				2305.974116282973
the noiseless door again turned on its hinges and the count of monte cristo reappeared				6779.910427857393
accordingly d artagnan on awaking found his breakfast waiting for him				31.40974025133551
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my words				697.1980728823789
what is the matter asked albert of franz when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions my dear fellow exclaimed albert what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness				1668.6094970652416
what possessions what reputation what pull as beauchamp says have i				1087.7058772225719
they must die die all together killed at one stroke by the thunder of men in default of god s				887.6987082279132
many might take for their device the epithet strong which formed the second part of his motto but very few gentlemen could lay claim to the faithful which constituted the first				805.3289287356414
he recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des saints pères where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the countess				4256.831260185681
i will denounce you before men as i have denounced you before god and if it be necessary that like lucretia i should sign my accusation with my blood i will sign it ah said my enemy in a jeering tone that s quite another thing				1552.4083681140407
but they could discern nothing but a man of middle height dressed in black apparently of a certain age for the end of a gray beard peeped out from the bottom of the mask that hid his features				5115.192939206029
he strove to collect a band of followers and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone whom he hoped to surpass				119802.94124129438
when you have given the letter to lord de winter and he has read it you will further say to him watch over his grace lord buckingham for they wish to assassinate him				29.95178918184909
d artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised				72312.42311501126
then i renewed the search				2680.968251699263
the person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of franz stood in a kind of half light that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features although his dress was easily made out				538.2075397739618
oh now i may say so so much the better replied monte cristo as that poor edmond will not have long to be loved by you				63.23682626768912
athos killed his adversary first				838.5439892959203

about two hundred persons had accompanied her in her flight				8452.844260872018
in fact mousqueton had not concealed from his master that he had met d artagnan and aramis and that d artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the béarnese pony upon which he had come to paris and which he had sold for three crowns				5530.821203675956
now i am going to put a question to you and one very much to the purpose too				3664.4840725817207
my sister how did your husband die horror cried porthos and aramis				143.26006260739305
the soldiers interposed their bayonets for they thought that he was about to attack the inspector and the latter recoiled two or three steps				1721.9569724159194
at this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door continued to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came up to the prisoner				1255.481458473694
then the pope and cæsar borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner				2107.6561013844066
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific cries two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with terror				1190.1093359272534
it was then into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young man advanced with a beating heart ranging his long rapier up his lanky leg and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap with that half smile of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face				643.5833251348649
i know who it is then putting his face to the lowered blinds he said i wish you joy my lord impudent fellow cried d artagnan you will get me turned off the gate groaned on its hinges and d artagnan seeing the way clear whipped his horses who started at a canter and five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal				230.35935945374337
m de villefort entered followed by barrois				2569.471946465917
bonaparte continued the baron is mortally wearied and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at porto longone and scratches himself for amusement added the king				519.497488786839

no matter				1029.966553721645
with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet and saluted with respect				1261.3458184398364
but monte cristo is not the only one i miss here i do not see morrel morrel				271.14416196146993
as to the poisoner they had heard no tidings of her whatever only that she must have made her escape through the garden on the sand of which her footsteps could be traced and the door of which had been found shut				14339.22475832316
do you think emmanuel would oblige me i will answer for him count well				479.98217607324256
each of them when the other was not looking hazarded a sly glance				3037.682981137429
when she wakes she can sup and he made some steps toward the door				189.8250407756878
i am repulsed on all sides what it is so indeed mademoiselle eugénie scarcely answers me and mademoiselle d armilly her confidant does not speak to me at all but the father has the greatest regard possible for you said monte cristo				305.2113495838332
and you were right cried aramis and porthos with one voice				805.8275289838255
the day came at length and was almost as feverish as the night had been but it brought reason to the aid of imagination and dantès was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain				6302.694799239772
the light had almost disappeared from the former doubtless madame de villefort had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the window				451.1867150265364
d avrigny returned about eight o clock in the morning he met villefort on his way to noirtier s room and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept				2981.259345759045
the funeral being over the guests returned to paris				479.4985816199058
but when is this ball to take place monday next monday next				8689.15429742581
planchet glared fiercely over the back of his armchair				21743.021818542387
as to porthos all his attention was concentrated on the allurements of the breakfast table				682.4482778894437

they might have remained much longer lost in one another without anyone noticing their abstraction				80503.94881516542
porthos turned aside in order not to show by his honest round face what was passing in his mind				694.7094827282966
now the queen is of a sensitive nature				3166.0039458338924
the young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness				7583.521787113929
from two o clock till five franz and albert followed in the fête exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the horses feet and the carriage wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight				3659.462103287028
he now arose his head bowed beneath the weight of grief and shaking his damp dishevelled hair he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined to seek his father that he might have someone to whom he could relate his misfortunes someone by whose side he might weep				2877.2467288819967
bernouin introduced him				34.72883176568088

the prince threw his bridle over the pommel of the saddle as he was wont to do when he wished to have both hands free unsealed the letter of madame de longueville and started at a gallop on the road to lens attended by raoul and his small escort whilst messengers sent to recall the troops set out with a loose rein in other directions				14082.868643420106
a man				142.73604774139574

the battle soon became general and the coadjutor performed miracles of valor				136600.74192468115
i am free then sir cried dantès joyfully				41452.8856046661
the duke meanwhile recovered his self control				220561.9964282465
valentine valentine he mentally ejaculated but his lips uttered no sound and as though all his strength were centred in that internal emotion he sighed and closed his eyes				605.1466637560558
athos fancied he had seen him among the crowd				3438.3727514274187
mordaunt replied grimaud				356.7036914786278
many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and m de monte cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the count a warning he might not be able to send another time if this first attempt should fail and another be made the count s first idea was that this was an artifice a gross deception to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a greater				137573.81046012003
what is your name i shall tell you my name in order that you may know where to find me my lord or my prince as it may suit you best to be called said our gascon who did not choose to seem to yield to a threat				215888.723910433

to this question de guiche could not respond				108319.46994344787
in the court are orange trees in pots turf and clumps of flowers and no steel traps no the stables are on either side of the gate which you see there and andrea continued his plan				1122.2141038752402
as to the wounded man he had been taken in at once and as we have said in a very bad state				6326.101818015681
not for the countess or for albert said monte cristo a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one blood washes out shame poor countess said maximilian i pity her very much she is so noble a woman pity albert also maximilian for believe me he is the worthy son of the countess				4521.746685920436
ah monsieur said planchet i saw one fall at each of his two shots and he appeared to me through the glass door to be fighting with his sword with the others brave athos murmured d artagnan and to think that we are compelled to leave him maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence				80069.27742333071
the coadjutor possessed perhaps as much wit as all those put together who were assembled at the court to laugh at him				34.51704850380324
he took up the deadly weapon again his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol				4227.302906855838
when this operation was complete he invited her to descend by offering her his hand				193.97194724021878

gentlemen once more take him to prison and keep him under key as long as possible that will give me time to pay him the officers were full of thanks and took away their prey				18096.92502053687
it was a tolerably fine winter s day and a ray of that pale english sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison				1250.9607525911993
on no pretense leave the door for you know that last night my lord punished a soldier for having quit his post for an instant although i during his absence watched in his place yes i know it said the soldier				3618.3426276148357
he will let you into the rooms in his tower said the curate				4379.710776575104
then they looked at one another				1060.4481454914585
he took cucumetto one side while the young girl seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque head dress to hide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits				4792.953766252426
athos must have become an idiot by this time from drinking				21517.741758556564

chapter ix				5129.775196110591

he would have spoken but his voice failed him				29.449728988917958
what do you say to a thousand crowns d artagnan pouted out his lower lip in a most extraordinary manner				779.6037829198849
he is of no earthly use to anybody and you monsieur du vallon is that your advice				1264.4025096702198
at last they lost sight of each other				419.7036529007933
he has at the request of your father opened an account of francs a month at m danglars which is one of the safest banks in paris and does my father mean to remain long in paris asked andrea				1751.9920264937691
will you sell him to me for that sum no but i will play for him what at dice no sooner said than done and i lost the horse				913.0386228975512
on her side the lady who from time to time blushed darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant porthos and then immediately the eyes of porthos wandered anxiously				56609.3628699521
do you wish to see her noirtier again made an affirmative sign				7349.346217007574
don t disturb yourself julie said he				8.25671463046677

this money was for her i destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the sea i buried our treasure in the little garden of the house my father lived in at marseilles on the allées de meilhan				11195.358875283388
when he had gained the angle of the street he turned				2936.1436451440018
so that now thanks be to god we do not want as monsieur can testify for partridges rabbits carp or eels all light wholesome food suitable for the sick but the wine said d artagnan who furnishes the wine				1923.5850071712036
what avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall				106666.88266043882
one of my friends one of my friends please to observe not myself said athos interrupting himself with a melancholy smile one of the counts of my province that is to say of berry noble as a dandolo or a montmorency at twenty five years of age fell in love with a girl of sixteen beautiful as fancy can paint				362493.9741803656
athos and d artagnan watched their approach from the window				478.426532810402
i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it you don t mention those who aided and abetted the deed said caderousse				643.307188392178

on arriving at the rue des prouvaires the curate pointed toward the square before the church				2583.993700078399
and therefore my dear monsieur bernouin if you wish to do what will be pleasing to your master announce to her majesty that i have come and tell her with what purpose whether he spoke seriously or in jest since it was evident that under existing circumstances d artagnan was the only man who could relieve the queen s uneasiness bernouin went without hesitation to announce to her this strange embassy and as he had foreseen the queen gave orders to introduce monsieur d artagnan at once				1047.0515485794108
buckingham remained for a moment dazzled				40302.46604444342

he knew the rapidity of decision and action that characterized his enemies and resolved to act with reference to that				724.2968074566567
unfortunately as he advanced his anger increased at every step and instead of the proper and lofty speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge he found nothing at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality which he accompanied with a furious gesture				3307.1553532248563
at this demand d artagnan gave his name very modestly emphasized the title of compatriot and begged the servant who had put the question to him to request a moment s audience of m de tréville a request which the other with an air of protection promised to transmit in due season				11542.214753307459
i made them one day to calculate the age of my father that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of mercédès to know if i should find her still free				2343.9146810375155
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet girl				1089.1071572397586

dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner who could hear the splash of the drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon				4366.752611471199
i returned to the seminary				268387.1929049546
sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law				1720.7027991613686

your pistols are beside your desk said monte cristo pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table				656.2386915996294

you have guessed rightly				8476.90906909112
nothing replied the latter only if the queen has the studs which i very much doubt count them sire and if you only find ten ask her majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here the king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him but he had not time to address any question to him a cry of admiration burst from every mouth				2449.904682262602
it must have been for his hide for certes the carcass is not worth eighteen livres				2005.5688091482234
poor queen murmured athos				18.54569230254117

still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three days she was sure he was well ah now i think of it the count of monte cristo can not appear in the hall said beauchamp				667.0918750622664
on arriving at the house morrel was not even out of breath for love lends wings to our desires but barrois who had long forgotten what it was to love was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use				3472.651566421247
you shall die and she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing table opened it with a feverish and trembling hand drew from it a small poniard with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade and then threw herself with a bound upon d artagnan				84.92250054879115
now that you are no longer beside me i am afraid every moment of erring				75270.29354704777
at the end of three months he had learned to read				14889.276430188895
he is an upstart a man of no name who will only be the tool of a party in france				568.7120554341183
a propos inform bazin will bazin go with us asked aramis				92.26385682072683
pretty strong rum said dantès wiping his brow with his sleeve				30879.467381496946
when i saw her weeping i began to cry too				3086.3406167565845
her first look on entering the room was at noirtier whose face independent of the emotion which such a scene could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health her second glance was at the dying man				149.50544324281282
the host obeyed				1513.0037725120674
peppino was decidedly an epicure				199662.145130333

she wore a blue and white striped vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls and a sort of bodice which closing only from the centre to the waist exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom it was fastened with three magnificent diamond clasps				294385.84940912627
here we are at the camp therefore gentlemen not a word more of this affair				1299.840983094101
i have already told you father that woman under that angelic appearance had an infernal soul and when i saw her when i recalled all the evil she had done to me to you				62.99860979829602
morrel does not know my name this worthy gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of thomson french of rome with whom your father does business the young girl turned pale and continued to descend while the stranger and cocles continued to mount the staircase				2799.65659690031
i am doing what is right the king waved his hand to tréville who left him and rejoined the musketeers whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with d artagnan				81.32393372755205
your guest is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes				181924.8749483771
to the judge to the judge madame it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that woman the anguish of her look the trembling of her whole frame				5037.166876417073

you edmond on the contrary you are still young handsome dignified it is because you have had faith because you have had strength because you have had trust in god and god has sustained you				58.93881895179626
edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make use of one arm				1258.5257386004703
what is his name you know him indeed yes it is surely not one of my friends replied d artagnan affecting hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant				9956.361269725634

when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist				195776.429714294
it had not been used				6807.179784545944
these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and franz could not consider them as game				2778.241731533106
you may madame said he with emphasis				89255.27062887349
yes returned d artagnan who had overheard him to night gentlemen we rescue the king d artagnan said athos this is no joke i trust				10891.835357764947
de winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence				89840.16876857108
it is understood of course that when we say the queen mazarin is meant				8370.531068154396
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i feel myself unworthy that of being the husband of mercédès nay nay cried caderousse smiling you have not attained that honor yet				1527.4283600193748
really asked athos				12.654929674537325
poor young man				134.36691200038962
truly my daughter replied he with a smile you are all you boast of being excepting one thing i will not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it eugénie looked at danglars much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed				88072.17621270345
he was cautioned not to let a bit of straw out of his hands under a louis the truss and they intrusted to him straw to the amount of four hundred and thirty louis				3271.8381243830454
morrel guessed all this				754.3485221554312
order out the carriage he said and remove the pistols which are in the holsters				6494.161794957136
you have read the letter yes you know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in italy this is the name of the lower class				69645.24987238728
he could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction but this smile soon disappeared and returning to the adventure of meung tell me continued he had not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek yes such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball was he not a fine looking man yes of lofty stature yes of pale complexion and brown hair yes yes that is he how is it sir that you are acquainted with this man				146.36298083761562
he thought himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated				9545.408173851718
the baroness porthos will sound particularly charming and the two friends began to laugh				2352.377237853864
when well assured this search was superfluous he followed d artagnan wondering to himself how this young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality and that he should know better than himself what had become of her				198.9827496584576
what do you say inquired charles rising				21331.280448949215
during the exchange of these two words felton drew back quickly and when lord de winter entered he was several paces from the prisoner				1247.2280385335184
i have a post by which i live at the death of monsieur de tréville who is old i may be a captain which is a very snug berth for a once penniless gascon				1156.8927461253766
monsieur duke i must have those letters sire notwithstanding monsieur duke at whatever price it may be i will have them i would however beg your majesty to observe do you then also join in betraying me monsieur cardinal by thus always opposing my will				744.7158804373469
laporte said the queen it is time for his majesty to go to bed the king asked to remain up having he said no wish to sleep but the queen was firm				3524.3822145013705
diable when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a father				917.512971340216
he has but one fault he is somewhat wilful but really on referring for the moment to what he said do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious i think so madame because i myself have made use of them that i might not be poisoned at naples at palermo and at smyrna that is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions i must have lost my life and your precautions were successful completely so yes i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia something of this sort indeed said the count with an air of surprise remarkably well counterfeited i really did not remember i inquired of you if poisons acted equally and with the same effect on men of the north as on men of the south and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south and that is the case observed monte cristo				358.2733196557758
you know poisons become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is one				786.94963740284
debray is with madame danglars nodded his head then turning to monte cristo said m				555.9316373788145
d artagnan resumed immediately the attitude of distrust that was habitual with him				37.20574498205379
barcelona has risen in his favor all that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of danglars who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stock jobber who only lost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow				2407.373502683765
but pardon said d artagnan with the most charming smile and putting his hand on the young man s shoulder if the illustrious general oliver cromwell has disposed of our prisoners in your favour he has of course made that act of donation in writing mordaunt stopped short				3887.605545375231
could a statue of marble have been more impassive and more mute				15440.550891466679
his quiet manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking and who still remained at the window				458.0594143553253
now then franz when for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society would you have me refuse				12598.341021510876
it is only the dead who do not return you think so porthos replied the musketeer with a sad smile which d artagnan alone understood				2604.313612142103
anne it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men but aramis after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos begged his friends not to revert to the subject again declaring that if a single word more was said to him about it he would never again implore his cousins to interfere in such affairs				1901.183628559515
in the middle of the street they saw grimaud and blaisois who were coming to find their masters				2937.616880260758
franz looked up they were opposite the rospoli palace				2178.2278211659464
very well if ever you meet him again wherever it may be whether on the high road or in the street or in a church anywhere that he or you may be put your foot on his neck and crush him without pity without mercy as you would crush a viper or a scorpion				79003.4242320839
i also looked at him then he understood and putting his hand into a drawer he took from it a quantity of notes on a bank in lyons for a thousand pistoles for a thousand pistoles just that amount the beggar not one too many and you have them they are here upon my word i think he acted very generously generously				111997.0016397495
pistache on a signal from his master placed himself on this line raised himself on his hind paws and holding in his front paws a wand with which clothes used to be beaten he began to dance upon the line with as many contortions as a rope dancer				34481.73239676096
i shut my eyes and i can see you as you then were i open them again and i see what you are now a hundred times more beautiful what folly murmured anne of austria who had not the courage to find fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his heart what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances and upon what then must i live				2075.009605283851
when he thought the matter over he could by no means account for this generous conduct on the part of thomson french towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this we had better help a man who owes us nearly francs and have those francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our money back again unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all morrel s correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a contrary decision				23741.99649392353
there was indeed reason to retreat to be alarmed and to scream				149302.20619069776
the officer entered				664.1895537000456
i have told you and i repeat it that to night we rescue charles i				1129.9376316803784
chapter xxxv				11445.197285849654
certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by m de villefort towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities then i should not have been an accomplice to thy death as i now am sweet beloved valentine but the accomplice shall become the avenger				22184.7665402402
like one of those drunken satyrs in the pictures of rubens				21749.03602099079
he assured me that nothing would be easier than to furnish all i desired				2508.4426305910565
why to accuse the man do you address the woman do i know m debray do i wish to know him do i wish to know that he gives advice do i wish to follow it do i speculate				133351.02845173705
but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards				5607.502616672428
his majesty in full dress was accompanied by his royal highness m le comte de soissons by the grand prior by the duc de longueville by the duc d eubœuf by the comte d harcourt by the comte de la roche guyon by m de liancourt by m de baradas by the comte de cramail and by the chevalier de souveray				70106.85652773707
fire replied the steward				2419.6334615748297
had i been alone i should scarcely have gone to rueil without great caution				15248.224681040478
the man was an enigma to franz				712.1610373487533
in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn				8097.7226760435515
ah if you had tasted my life you would not desire any other and would never return to the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there revenge for instance observed franz				750.3878528249173
your having sent for me is another proof of your affection				2588.29376088017
i can not explain myself but watch over him emmanuel looked around the room and caught sight of the pistols his eyes rested on the weapons and he pointed to them				110.035368877962
but we have forgotten to mention one circumstance which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in one of the rooms he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition				90538.57694111118
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions				1203.835414534556
my brother who made you his heir died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces all over the body				343.0654147633289
the queen clasped her hands in enthusiastic gratitude whilst her daughter threw her arms around her mother s neck and kissed her her own eyes streaming with tears				1316.8278958197764
who are you i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the château d if				3682.3856983247942
they will therein find portraits penciled by the hand of a master and although these squibs may be for the most part traced upon the doors of barracks and the walls of cabarets they will not find the likenesses of louis xiii anne of austria richelieu mazarin and the courtiers of the period less faithful than in the history of m anquetil				74619.89141958042
raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed at him and remembering the recommendation of athos he with the rapidity of lightning made his horse rear as the shot was fired				1859.9272554044512
suddenly about ten paces from them a man advanced from behind a tree and aimed at vampa				7817.640260293672
i understand the nature of your alarms madame said the count carefully examining the child but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness your little charge has not received the least injury his insensibility is merely the effects of terror and will soon pass are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears				24585.776477511336
the procurator s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud all surrounded by duchesses and marchionesses who cast bags of money at his feet				816.0568208226265
he turned his head looked around him and saw no one but the sound was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality				5011.144795664813
my dear d artagnan said aramis don t be too angry with me i beg				29618.713447387814
franz was about to ring for signor pastrini when that worthy presented himself				175.2318648140656
in the most simple and natural manner possible				946.1956985062417
that evening i had translated an episode of judith and had just communicated my verses to the lady who gave me all sorts of compliments and leaning on my shoulder was reading them a second time with me				79.24696251746126
but though i can not give my own name not possessing one i can tell them my father s				868.7202738992704
athos and aramis turned also and went to salute the coadjutor and the duc de beaufort				4809.506146911773
yes madame well then pursued madame g with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes i am sorry to say i can not replied the baron and i was just asking the same question of albert are you very anxious to know countess asked albert				313.3844781429886
let him pass d artagnan was perhaps about to reply when a blow similar to that of a mallet falling on the head of an ox was heard				730.683089395933
dantès as we have said had traced the marks along the rocks and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph				81590.90184347666
the four friends took leave of him and asked if they could deliver any message for him to his brother				2010.3609555763926
what next				14104.441053636912
the house is sold then demanded the concierge and this gentleman is coming to live here yes my friend returned the count and i will endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old master oh monsieur said the concierge i shall not have much cause to regret him for he came here but seldom it is five years since he was here last and he did well to sell the house for it did not bring him in anything at all what was the name of your old master said monte cristo				377.48391045600437
dantès drew back and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to terror				1161.842221087637
monseigneur i was furnished with a description of your horses your lackeys your countenances nothing was omitted go on go on said d artagnan who quickly understood whence such an exact description had come				1511.2494868535284
now said the unknown to franz i do not know if you are of my opinion but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to address one another				1198.7150498482838
no stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of ether and water				768.9472659162572
to give them the order to charge and run down these miserable rebels and the king putting spurs to his horse set off to the tent of lord leven				15979.423163677699
yes continued athos four times only once at the house of monsieur créquy another time at my own house in the country in my château at when i had a château a third time at monsieur de tréville s where it surprised us all and the fourth time at a cabaret where it fell to my lot and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it then monsieur takes his horse back again said the englishman				1271.656398694723
by demanding my head of the cardinal cried d artagnan pale with terror				1217.364493890305
of how much does he rob you every year on my word replied the count not more than another				1195.2630422051052
sleeplessness inflamed my eyes i had not dared to sleep a single instant				1205.4673487252157
but alas if he was the friend of d artagnan he must have lent him his assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated the project of his eminence if he was the friend of d artagnan he was the enemy of the cardinal and she doubtless would succeed in involving him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer				1025.2038515953577
i remember just at his age how deep in love i was with a grecian statue which our good king then henry iv gave my father insomuch that i was mad with grief when they told me that the story of pygmalion was nothing but a fable it is mere want of occupation				14973.175500847918
are you out of your senses or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me				74.69617446037218
mademoiselle said the stranger one day you will receive a letter signed sinbad the sailor do exactly what the letter bids you however strange it may appear yes sir returned julie				15944.73081982826

he s in the bastile that is to say he was there replied planchet				484.2613870825269
now go down said the abbé folding his arms				544.795897415354
i have not time for anybody s affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests but i make an agreement with the man who pastes up the papers and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in case any person staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the time and place etc upon my word that is a most delicate attention on your part signor pastrini cried franz				754.8166388707493
in an hour inquired danglars turning pale				777.1485702605107
not i unfortunately said porthos				10.825780265636352
they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments				136852.9216596015
the woman screamed and cried for help but her cries were soon stifled				72801.28824843968
conspiracy danglars followed edmond and mercédès with his eyes until the two lovers disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas then turning round he perceived fernand who had fallen pale and trembling into his chair while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking song				28281.59790440591

open it is i but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was uttered the door remained closed				3064.452277903641

in military dress he was indeed as we have stated a very handsome man				93.04830108392707
everyone must live certainly go on i loved my brother tenderly as i told your excellency and i resolved not to send the money but to take it to him myself				630.2324949393916
the poor women felt instinctively that they required all their strength to support the blow that impended				137577.09051446232
what an appetite you used to have				4128.44825788187
as the last stroke died away i saw a faint light shine through the windows of the private staircase by which we have just descended				3767.3173978755767
now let us pass the orangery to the hunting lodge				172921.10759712692
then how do you hope valentine will escape noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot				3655.7820734392108
silence said d artagnan taking her hand which without thinking of it she abandoned to him				38.10397594218205
what good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my heart only to make a woman of thirty nine look like a woman of fifty				233041.66806088437
advancing a few steps toward the queen he knelt down				570.8363933455959
bonacieux uttered a little cry and fled				7219.400581019536
the accident was set down to the account of robbers who had stopped the chaise in the wood				6790.794675202817
as to his going or staying i feel too much gratitude to the cardinal not to leave him free in all his actions he shall do what he wishes to do a transient pallor overspread the speaking countenance of the prime minister he looked at the queen with anxiety				2247.7140706720515
i have no right to it				76.74969933452344
she evidently interrogated him by her look				1595.9273951060268
i am going to fire gentlemen exclaimed d artagnan whom reflection never abandoned gentlemen think of what you are about				3814.8128307151605
diable said morcerf				2557.924546613717
i shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance replied eugénie				2194.9392422998953
the count watched him with a feeling of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows the french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to three weeks since in l impartial who not only surrendered the castle of yanina but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that time fernand as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name				787.0712267676016
have i not a single friend in the world who will aid me either to live or to die take courage said grimaud they are gone to find assistance who are you asked the wounded man fixing his half opened eyes on grimaud				1000.5624450487644
a florentine adventurer sire and that was all while the august spouse of your majesty is anne of austria queen of france that is to say one of the greatest princesses in the world she is not the less guilty monsieur duke				789.0263620053088
i want to carry off my son from them with yourself				932.7881928883713
be easy my dear boy they will come in due season it is only a question of how much shall be charged for them morcerf then with that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to bed slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival time in a coach with six horses				983.0756103616776
humph said morcerf this is the second time you have refused to dine with my mother it is evident that you wish to avoid her monte cristo started				1797.5333909321491
i can not be mistaken there are your horses				986.3384749411392
ah he has a niece interrupted porthos				126.07041872133057
why does the boat go so fast asked i of my mother				695.1535173897789
well asked he of the count what has then happened nothing replied the count only as you see the carnival has commenced				8453.76329452309
they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that year and that franz who for the last three or four years had inhabited italy should act as cicerone to albert				357.0038557106464
winter s regiment was ranged on some high ground above the camp				2420.228880732819
the abbé busoni had watched till daylight and then left without calling anyone				2079.7167631950247
he stopped a moment in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into madame de saint méran s morrel concealed himself behind a door valentine remained motionless grief seeming to deprive her of all fear				1229.7279023951696
i thought you had softened				26333.28130942127
athos smiled				475.73488053729756
these two newly enlisted soldiers marched gravely after the valet de chambre who opened the door of the vestibule then another which seemed to be that of a waiting room and showing them two stools your orders are very simple he said don t allow anybody except one person to enter here				1224.8787440572398
so far then said danglars mentally all has gone as i would have it				85.88921282345083
eh he said to the postilion eh mio caro this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from hearing his daughter sing italian duets with cavalcanti				2334.4226185193193
you see i destroy it oh exclaimed dantès you are goodness itself listen continued villefort you can now have confidence in me after what i have done oh command and i will obey listen this is not a command but advice i give you speak and i will follow your advice i shall detain you until this evening in the palais de justice				1819.020498799882
bonacieux he will rouse the whole quarter bonacieux called a long time but as such cries on account of their frequency brought nobody in the rue des fossoyeurs and as lately the mercer s house had a bad name finding that nobody came he went out continuing to call his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the rue du bac				80264.84478383111
in the evening on his return franz found a letter from the embassy informing him that he would have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day				418.293108612916
the instant the letter was written carlini seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger				6832.727524173457
i mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater can it be possible murmured villefort clasping his hands				548.2661191520187
is that what you wish for said barrois				6403.639212021639
i find england a charming country and i stay but on one condition only what is it that i am not forced to learn english well now said athos triumphantly i swear to you my friend by the god who hears us i believe that there is a power watching over us and that we shall all four see france again so be it said d artagnan but i i confess i have a contrary conviction our good d artagnan said aramis represents among us the opposition in parliament which always says no and always does aye but in the meantime saves the country added athos				173.04820117009515
porthos had six occasions and contrived in the same manner that his friends should partake of them aramis had eight of them				109.49062489814672
d artagnan pulled up his horse and whilst his musketeers continued to charge he returned and bent with drawn sword over the man he had knocked down				636.7384085476433
you are a brave fellow as i told you monsieur replied planchet picards are found out by being used				10243.707248069175
but pray sit down thank you said albert with a cold and formal bow				2592.9830063994727
a cold perspiration burst from every pore and his hair stood on end				741.8485890715918
it was then especially while conversing with madame danglars and apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation that the count noticed m andrea cavalcanti s solicitude his manner of listening to the music at the door he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration				2954.6517567093665
he is and he is not replied athos that is to say he is dismissed by one half of france but by intrigues and promises he makes the other half sustain him you will perceive that this may last a long time however sir said the stranger he has neither fled nor is in prison no sir not at this moment at least sirs accept my thanks for your politeness said the young man retreating				105020.47701038903
to old times he said				268.14591108528424
may i reckon on you as an auxiliary d artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature wished to reach				4778.804849008808
since that time many things have happened to you				49.21510836218341
he certainly did not prevent others from speaking of them before him although it was easy to perceive that this kind of conversation in which he only mingled by bitter words and misanthropic remarks was very disagreeable to him				34.63842442009148
we will each take a thousand livres to be employed as seems good and we will leave a fund of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbé here for extraordinary occasions or common wants				7732.901608322935
this was the price of the queen s diamond				1575.368679388274
yes i have seen him he replied and he has handed this letter to me				49.13715215738189
yes in landed property no in stock yes the stock is in your own hands the look which m noirtier cast on barrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to find				157302.52960926254
the point aimed at by every poniard				21613.046126464593
i now understand why you are in the service of cromwell you hate the king yes my lord i hate him said the young man				144.09080996690585
keep the commission it is yours				2318.457160847564
but are you no longer aware continued anne giving that sweet expression to her voice which she could do at will that in former days the queen had once need of a young brave and devoted cavalier that she found this cavalier and that although he might have thought that she had forgotten him she had kept a place for him in the depths of her heart no madame i was ignorant of that said the musketeer				946.9657269099177
standing on the prow was a tall man of a dark complexion who saw with dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan				153501.02396742065
let us load the guns the four musketeers went to work and as they were loading the last musket grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready				1037.1303645727378
why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief why did you so awkwardly let it fall i have said monsieur and i repeat that the handkerchief did not fall from my pocket and thereby you have lied twice monsieur for i saw it fall ah you take it with that tone do you master gascon				1153.9314268860733
the face of the shortest of those three gentlemen no he looked to me but tis impossible at this instant the sergeant who had been for his orders returned and pointing to the three gentlemen in cloaks said the passports are in order let these three gentlemen pass the three gentlemen bowed and hastened to take advantage of this permission				6231.2804005770295
there grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to visit père lachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous				5298.82877286458
i beg you to do so i beg you to excuse me madame i wish to add nothing to the recital of these gentlemen until they perceive themselves that they have perhaps been mistaken mistaken cried the queen almost suffocated by emotion mistaken				1807.7268980879048
you have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels always followed by such happy results alas dear friend said aramis our late adventures have disgusted me with military life				563.234671947904
in ten minutes d artagnan reached the end of an alley regularly planted with fine poplars and terminating in an iron gate the points and crossed bars of which were gilt				5086.269079312135
he easily understood why his son did not come to see him before he went to avenge his father s honor but when that was done why did not his son come and throw himself into his arms				508.3691452658321
i know you are going to leave the rue du helder without taking anything with you				62.64528161971599
do you take any interest in politics a gleam of light shone in aramis s eyes as brief as the shadow that had passed over his face but not so brief but that it was seen by d artagnan				81.38600263947625
i rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies very well replied m danglars who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a word since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker				9107.301919468635
oh make yourself easy on that head said ali smiling selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter				1348.313358095102
he again struck it and with greater force				3596.215527360737
he now determined not to begin the game with d artagnan till he knew completely all his adversary s cards				115343.30932480638
meanwhile emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count oh count how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us				319.98582291981404
you are going sir yes said cromwell				11324.960705031479
the gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight but they were forced when the door was open to pass through a throng of curious glances and whispering voices				27855.16360429768
now an englishman is an enemy this port wine belongs to the english therefore it belongs to us and our masters asked blaisois stupefied by this harangue delivered with an air of profound sagacity will they be of your opinion mousqueton smiled disdainfully				5398.692775490774
no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper end of the rue d enfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces so that one of the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child while the other remained in my possession i rang the bell and fled with all speed				1695.5636673246286
hold your tongue you stupid fellow said the young man i am d artagnan don t you know me				53.38297397044958
yet i think i hear her piano it is mademoiselle louise d armilly who is playing while mademoiselle danglars is in bed well said madame danglars come and undress me they entered the bedroom				2156.8991434604077
athos went to pay a visit to madame de vendome left his name at madame de chevreuse s and wrote the following letter to d artagnan dear friend i am about to set off with aramis on important business				2537.880658355297
felton abandon me				54.936417536712284
has not one of you a cross asked athos				26.457972165277447
she should have wanted nothing have you ever seen the queen of england inquired d artagnan				48.25925531154204
whither art thou going grimaud to join the vicomte de bragelonne in flanders your honor they were taking the road toward paris when groans which seemed to proceed from a ditch attracted their attention				1144.613564754928
too many diamonds too much gold and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which monte cristo seeks to behold dantès				661.3749128450036
in god s name answer me he is with edward who is not quite well replied madame de villefort no longer being able to avoid answering				41556.352609594265
for my part said d artagnan i say this must come to an end murderer as you were of your uncle				124405.57350177744
in the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts and children at play				3003.5329282324146
caderousse shuddered				3029.7758977554736
he became curious to solve the problem				47713.84447377616
and blood too				2524.7651126342953
mazarin did not even turn around				2088.8782467056208
you spoke to me athos resumed of porthos have you persuaded him to seek his fortune				1161.435649237001
you have a quick horse a light tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel if i had missed you tonight i might not have had another chance you see i do not conceal myself you are lucky i wish i could say as much for i do conceal myself and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added caderousse with his unpleasant smile				527.7886034588271
one thing i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be time as it would require three days to do that so you see we must do without this little superfluity and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by tomorrow it might be too late then he will be able to give us an answer tonight oh i expect him every minute at this instant the door opened and the head of signor pastrini appeared				1136.6352440752403
the bolt gave way and the door opened				1136.0722560218467
may i ask what you were doing there my father who is a merchant placed me with his correspondent who in turn sent his son to join our house in london were you pleased with paris sir yes but you are much in want of a revolution like our own not against your king who is a mere child but against that lazar of an italian the queen s favorite ah				553.6692135471017
you know how much he loves me my mother				690.8352698651497
the reference is no doubt to the wistaria frutescens ed				7179.536986046325
athos not only failed to reply he even changed the subject of conversation				567.7106456135832
i hope you have no repugnance to accept me as your guardian in the interim oh no monsieur d artagnan said raoul you are such a brave gentleman and the comte de la fere has so much affection for you eh				1997.5888542166
they breakfasted with a good appetite looking now and then at poor raoul who with moist eyes and a full heart scarcely ate at all				179.43972597490747
how can such enormous jars have been manufactured ah				583.0526842385397
keep your ill humor at home in your money boxes or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them not so replied danglars your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it				86.08351882236508
s go to the king s treasurer at blois tell him your name and show him this letter you will receive two hundred pistoles assuredly said d artagnan i admire this piece of prose				241780.2121126655
get me out of this in heaven s name he said or i shall leave my carcass here and those of all my men a great tumult arose in the midst of which even the noise of thunder could not have been heard				708.1672144756084
at length the shutter closed				2346.421827264892
why do you mention my father stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today because i am he who saved your father s life when he wished to destroy himself as you do today because i am the man who sent the purse to your young sister and the pharaon to old morrel because i am the edmond dantès who nursed you a child on my knees morrel made another step back staggering breathless crushed then all his strength give way and he fell prostrate at the feet of monte cristo				356.43403139329104
the host on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra horses advanced respectfully to the door				175.25141825801094
it is well said monte cristo whose countenance brightened at these words you wish it you are inflexible				93952.11744650031
five letters to put before his three names a tiny coronet to paint upon the panels of his carriage				564.2260340456688
now in spite of the nobility of his countenance the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the glass it was by no means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity				20779.63276382685
and if the suspicions of your majesty which i still continue to doubt should prove to have any foundation what a terrible disclosure what a fearful scandal but as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief he should have been louis xiii				729.8933071234875
balls parties and fêtes are over the italian opera is in london the french opera everywhere except in paris				527.1050096041704
ah continued caderousse speaking in the highly colored language of the south the world grows worse and worse				3310.702292732246
yes my son and he rendered very important services to your father				885.1360209557565
then i thought she would remember it was through my chamber you had penetrated hers and that then she would suppose i was your accomplice so i took what little money i had and the best of my things and i got away				990.0114633636472
u s laws alone swamp our small staff				4993.607948825578
during this time porthos played close				93831.59359303018
he fancied that they buried the dead at the château d if and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a prisoner he calculated on raising the earth with his shoulders but unfortunately their arrangements at the château frustrated his projects				11585.058263405068
and what will that signify to me				79.26525396997384
the wounds that i make are better than that witness the executioner of bethune my uncle and king charles				2888.626408528226
i shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you dantès took the hand of the abbé in his and affectionately pressed it				101.01467933717325
thence he saw the king the queen and monsieur mazarin and heard the mass as well as if he had been on duty				4019.2018431398515
it was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not behind the vehicle he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had sent them back and without dropping the reins he sprang from his box to open the door				184.2841434990438
i should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses				974.3690771049285
this person a sailor of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the island of elba				1937.810493292572
still more he has lifted the corner of her mask that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered her so strong				6202.750065342495
help cried he				10.280825335652938
he is a very strange man she said and in my opinion is himself the adelmonte he talks about as to monte cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations				42169.93055237291
take my advice leave things just as they are besides you are neither of you now your own masters he belongs to the fronde and you to the queen of england				891.6725123474498
about five minutes replied the captain				1163.178706196553
i answered mazarin i shall not sleep at all i have work to do gaston desired that he should be shown into the room wherein he was to sleep without in the least concerning himself as to where his wife and daughter were to repose				2077.7283917405675
albert stood one moment speechless by the side of his mother s bed				771.9752455267856
if i am free why these bars and these doors				2787.4960486995956
and now to table said athos				5.464699769302202
why does he go in secret				900.9593329731385
the aperture of the rock had been closed with stones then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite				202170.26948114642
we shall wait for you d artagnan said athos loud enough for the cardinal to hear him				27.595670685947162
but hush here comes somebody tis caderousse who has heard of your arrival and no doubt comes to congratulate you on your fortunate return ah lips that say one thing while the heart thinks another murmured edmond				1505.4854591537603
we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof				119093.25547346182
what will you do with the letter then asked porthos				39.57750111833592
ah sir exclaimed cocles what can it mean the pharaon come dear ones said morrel rising from his seat let us go and see and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence they all went out and on the stairs met madame morrel who had been afraid to go up into the study				2301.0203654092247
well asked the two gendarmes				18133.01411556812
a week before his return lord de winter died leaving me his sole heir				8287.106640117321
they conducted me to the chatelet where i slept soundly being very sure that on the next day i should go forth free				2316.5266102294368
yes replied morcerf but that will plunge my mother into positive grief then do not marry her said the count				255.65599695583649
sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers				17779.49193966952
and then shut out from friendship having but one affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she thought of herself of no one but herself				1905.5219036503056
he told himself that it was the enmity of man and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery				11640.365435564698
and how said harrison laughing did this serious calamity of going without breakfast happen to you in a very simple manner colonel said d artagnan				72.1953781977526
to horse				828.0817814732599
it appears that i had made a mistake monsieur that i had arrested the wrong person and that he whom i ought to have arrested had escaped but athos cried d artagnan whose impatience was increased by the disregard of the authorities athos where is he as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner resumed the innkeeper i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him at liberty				2074.5129650020936

besides they felt that the dénouement of this second odyssey was at hand and that there remained but a single effort to make				2712.062377097434
may i also be allowed said morcerf to pay my respects to mademoiselle danglars wait a moment said the banker stopping the young man do you hear that delightful cavatina				99781.14914198928

p s do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte cristo at your house				507.32325685758246

you who speak english like john bull himself are master tom lowe we your three companions				1492.7087508109837
what is his bearing mordaunt hesitated but it seemed as though he was constrained to tell the truth				1434.407972891305
he thought directly of his bag and rushed from the inner room where he was sleeping				4355.5521101701925
in the name of the queen i forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey and do you command nothing in your own name in my name said mme				211.6576219427639
the court made songs on the parisians and the parisians on the court and the casualties though not mortal were painful as are all wounds inflicted by the weapon of ridicule				4064.6247835911927
ma foi yes like you i hesitated but the count s eloquence decides me let us go then said franz since you wish it but on our way to the piazza del popolo i wish to pass through the corso				7367.409242258076
but what s that to us				342.21010825712926
monte cristo descended into the courtyard walked all over the house without giving any sign of approbation or pleasure until he entered his bedroom situated on the opposite side to the closed room then he approached a little piece of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous visit				3435.344208880031
this man except a sword had all the appearance of a soldier and his buff boots still slightly covered with dust indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the day				448.3091471856069
yes the poor man may be expected to leave me a widow any hour continued she throwing a significant glance at porthos				182.4081671856198
the vicomte de bragelonne who will have the honor of remitting this letter to your majesty is the friend of my son who owes to him his life he is a gentleman in whom your majesty may confide entirely in case your majesty may have some verbal or written order to remit to me				97.33441792032977
remember also villefort that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her hand as i now do at your entreaty				5061.663263978601
the musketeer advanced two steps and pushed d artagnan aside with his hand				179.25825199393037
she listened at eugénie s door and hearing no sound tried to enter but the bolts were in place				584.2399297443803
he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to conduct him to m noirtier but no one answered the servants having as we know deserted the house				508.54661984385575
d artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale				100431.28890809136
thank god thank god yes it is i said d artagnan it is i whom god has sent to watch over you was it with that intention you followed me asked the young woman with a coquettish smile whose somewhat bantering character resumed its influence and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy				1155.5094852776742
no i grieve not on my own account i shall always find a resource my books my pencils my piano all the things which cost but little and which i shall be able to procure will remain my own				967.6710787003723
the count pretends i have not him to thank so be it i will erect an altar deo ignoto listen said monte cristo i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the father in law and the young man there is only mademoiselle eugénie who appears but little charmed with the thoughts of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear liberty retains any affection for me and do you say this wedding is at hand oh yes in spite of all i could say				1353.6692536171877

upon my word you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him oh as for parricides and such dreadful people as that interposed renée it matters very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for don t you see renée the king is the father of his people and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty two millions of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale i don t know anything about that replied renée but m de villefort you have promised me have you not always to show mercy to those i plead for make yourself quite easy on that point answered villefort with one of his sweetest smiles you and i will always consult upon our verdicts my love said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand				695.0027126121162
i see				803.3123292465018
d artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could mistaking one sleeve for the other so greatly was he still agitated				5575.327071867703
mazarin shrugged his shoulders and pretended to despise the populace but he turned visibly pale and ran to his closet trembling all over locked up his gold and jewels in his caskets and put his finest diamonds on his fingers				891.2504059801428
he is a bully and so am i his cassock is a burden to him and i imagine i have had enough of mine in fact there is so much resemblance between us that i sometimes believe he is aramis and i am the coadjutor				1281.3233734673715
a propos said m de tréville calling him back				561.1640433384212
well here we are at last said one of them				87.22259557091668
anne of austria was informed of it and concealed her uneasiness from every one				759.454782437063
but that s quite enough gentlemen please to understand that s enough				851.4859939596976
well the man whom i offer you is a general syndic and what do you know of him nothing my lord except that he is tormented with remorse what makes you think so on the twenty eighth of every month he makes me say a mass for the repose of the soul of one who died a violent death yesterday i said this mass again and his name maillard but i do not think it is his right one and think you that we should find him at this hour at his post certainly let us go and see your beggar sir and if he is such as you describe him you are right it will be you who have discovered the true treasure gondy dressed himself as an officer put on a felt cap with a red feather hung on a long sword buckled spurs to his boots wrapped himself in an ample cloak and followed the curate				4034.4708194181085
he promised to be here and i have very great faith in planchet who appears to me to be a very good lad but if he does not come said d artagnan				49.7989922141339
there s another brave and excellent young man do you know him asked the officer				1337.5483350677473
this time in spite of my terrors in spite of my agony i began to feel a devouring hunger				1316.3338214162175
this evening especially aramis was melancholy and thoughtful				1915.5000928309862
we must confess these three strange names struck us and it immediately occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms under which d artagnan had disguised names perhaps illustrious or else that the bearers of these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which from caprice discontent or want of fortune they had donned the simple musketeer s uniform				5015.108153238182
nothing would be more easy said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail but this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal i have that permission said the gentleman drawing the paper from his pocket here it is have it examined by the governor of the port said the shipmaster and give me the preference where shall i find the governor at his country house and that is situated at a quarter of a league from the city				1007.4861883568288
he had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first journey and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy				1154.5368467704698
you are stupid replied the cardinal				303.43025652311894
then the inconvenience became distress				7881.938378406436
ah it is you monsieur				872.0105689486221
the interests of that kingdom and those of england though taking now diverse directions are very nearly the same				1123.3834002604767
it had evidently been rolled across the pass by some arm of giant strength				1867.6555969931635
de winter made the grooms who carried the arms and the porters with the luggage descend first and was about to follow them				113.41301849166487
this brought back to franz in spite of himself the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the countess g and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box was a vampire				79357.27411871903
one of your guards my prince a man of talent and merit whom you will like as i and monsieur de chavigny do i am sure why does he take my comb why do you take my lord s comb asked la ramee				1529.3078904006554

coquenard whom porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the table				660.8408949348589

waiter said danglars pen ink and paper pen ink and paper muttered fernand				2121.4880010116344
beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room				186.3915341351123
and this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young d artagnan for so was the don quixote of this second rosinante named from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous appearance that such a steed gave him good horseman as he was				1866.38607927933
and moreover my dear child continued d artagnan i am making use of the privilege conceded to me by your guardian i do not understand you sir said raoul				658.27770374778
it need not be said that planchet in resuming his former functions resumed also his former humility and was not ashamed to make his breakfast on what was left by d artagnan				75.76668265865455
let her then exhaust her vengeance on me alone my dear friend of what consequence is it if she kills me said athos				177.72269080290218

most undoubtedly said planchet				324.0409707678164
what is there in them he added putting his lantern on one of the casks				95954.2008119744
d artagnan took charge of it				92.8078224206303
bowing under the weight of twenty four years reminiscences he thought not of albert of beauchamp of château renaud or of any of that group but he thought of that courageous woman who had come to plead for her son s life to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret capable of destroying forever in that young man s heart every feeling of filial piety				41405.47367635309
praise god monsieur replied they bowing together				629.5359782368316
the man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again				302.1238061058645
d artagnan dismissed planchet and requested his visitor to be seated				5969.645050093932
barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness				11196.43727656741
the count alone seemed unmoved nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks				634.3794069786751
what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman				12266.568064557821
the young man uttered a cry and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy as herself				1893.1323852923706
but where is franz in the first carriage with m de villefort who considers him already as one of the family such was the conversation in almost all the carriages these two sudden deaths so quickly following each other astonished everyone but no one suspected the terrible secret which m d avrigny had communicated in his nocturnal walk to m de villefort				364.04582019817735
all london was crowding to the doors of the house				520.190563815372
in about the space of a second a private door opened and ali appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia				75218.98594956748
we must ask the comte de la fere the question				585.0866123137902
never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness i dragged myself to the foot of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me				79.15790873236227
on on he cried this is no moment for compliments or rather back for the battle seems to be lost by the frondeurs it is a matter of indifference to me said aramis i came here only to meet de chatillon i have met him i am contented tis something to have met de chatillon in a duel and besides we have a prisoner said athos pointing to raoul				699.6905730758556
no she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was empty				1813.5503897210206

the light made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the men they were scarcely perceptible the darkness was so great				4215.129303173841
i once bore another which you knew but you have certainly forgotten it tell it me sir formerly said the count i was athos madame de chevreuse looked astonished				2354.9192628328915

if i am caught i risk nothing but being taken back again to prison				1226.8819803827244
he determined therefore to direct his course as clear from it as he could when on the opposite side of the road from behind a rock he perceived the extremity of another musket				11689.870380157212
oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that noirtier is the father of villefort i am lost and he fixed his eyes upon edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts				1112.7601689563858
behind the door keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her				210.28204626145913
and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret				884.2387422180545
the procureur who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between m noirtier and the elder d épinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his wife				1303.977982936962
think what a solemn engagement you are making one has offered a wealthy shopkeeper the other a count you are going then to offer a prince are you i offer you a beggar my lord ah				551.2135736166417
this time i too saw them said porthos				12.009542726540994
i will however inform monsieur d artagnan of your arrival here comminges then led the count to a room on the ground floor of a pavilion at the end of the orangery				5195.73064185145
the cardinal saw that it was now high time to come to the assistance of anne				2487.554945049661
because madame it was necessary to prove to your majesty one thing of which you doubted that is that we still possess amongst us some valor and are worthy of some consideration at your hands and that valor would shrink from no undertaking according to what i see it has hesitated at nothing in the past why then should it be less daring in the future then in case of my refusal this valor should a struggle occur will even go the length of carrying me off in the midst of my court to deliver me into the hands of the fronde as you propose to deliver my minister we have not thought about it yet madame answered d artagnan with that gascon effrontery which had in him the appearance of naivete but if we four had resolved upon it we should do it most certainly i ought muttered anne to herself by this time to remember that these men are giants alas madame exclaimed d artagnan this proves to me that not till to day has your majesty had a just idea of us perhaps said anne but that idea if at last i have it your majesty will do us justice				1590.666178835543
on my right i saw the tree behind me the rock				2847.2426988549355
you are not a priest you are a musketeer a musketeer for a time my friend as the cardinal says a musketeer against my will but a churchman at heart believe me				82.44279069120483
so much the better for me sir if you speak to me as you say with frankness for then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions but if you have entertained any doubt as naturally you may i feel that i am ruining myself by speaking the truth				1453.6767151458275
but wait				4671.546503368889
oh sir in the most natural way possible replied he to whom they had given the title of count				303.61667038756076
he had not done so for ten years before				826.9717844432679
has this woman been relating her crimes to you				56.23930440303527
cries were heard from the camp come down				571.5878763342954
of all that passed in that sleep or the time which glided away while it lasted i have no remembrance				8728.172195501016
they announced to all their comrades that they had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them and in fact they went away quite proud and happy oh the miserable wretches murmured the queen they shall pay dearly for their boldness and it is i who promise this then turning to d artagnan she said sir you have given me this evening the best advice i have ever received				2213.889196722314
athos mounted more slowly after speaking in a low voice to the lackey who instead of following them immediately returned to their rooms				20917.259813410652
what is the matter sir asked monte cristo advancing to meet the commissioner				134264.06602437395
i know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the daughter of danglars what				600.0258011750468
i shall be gone only a few moments villefort hastily quitted the apartment but reflecting that the sight of the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace				3166.103585511187
the bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screw driver to take them off				1413.6591555528016
alas poor albert				339.673806193732
what is to be said				325.8498061165008
oh oh he at length muttered do you see what				519.6711665223081
his excellency the count of monte cristo had he said given positive orders that the carriage was to remain at their lordships orders all day and they could therefore dispose of it without fear of indiscretion they resolved to profit by the count s courtesy and ordered the horses to be harnessed while they substituted evening dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained				48609.603123260065
this will do said he and from this letter which might have ruined me i will make my fortune				1159.5840594862518
stop a moment cried d artagnan pray how many men have you on board captain i don t understand was the reply				1029.5806007615174
albert let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the carriage alone the next day				414.877257652943
well my dear porthos said d artagnan that s the very thing it came into my head to do athos understood all now				1296.2862694886855
i make no account of the harm mordaunt can do cried d artagnan				45.5751187029946
he quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty paces of him they were the heads of the two soldiers				2322.2367168313676
they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret left bazin with him who besides in a skirmish was more embarrassing than useful and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens				42007.08792677734
the stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who like franz preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the frivolous gabble of the guides				3889.8752035035864
moderato he cried as they descended				5453.773503639618
château renaud returned debray you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint germain do not pay any attention to him count live in the chaussée d antin that s the real centre of paris boulevard de l opéra said beauchamp the second floor a house with a balcony				8396.795555855111
but lose no time we have lost too much already that is true				1110.4734900168698
in the eyes of many benedetto appeared if not a victim to at least an instance of the fallibility of the law				1720.3360769657897
in the night he slept but in the morning refreshed and calm he was inspired with his clearest views of everything				851.0443585937271
are you not the captain fernand who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor ali				2345.3054695202395
when left alone the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence				513.5266944925257
you shall place it on that table and you may remain between it and me felton offered the weapon to milady who examined the temper of it attentively and who tried the point on the tip of her finger				1857.935497819097
but said d artagnan in the ear of athos you are going to get us all killed without mercy we are much more likely to be killed said athos if we do not go my faith gentlemen said porthos turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache that s a fair bet i hope i take it said m de busigny so let us fix the stake you are four gentlemen said athos and we are four an unlimited dinner for eight				3992.1860044694795
the officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him				37.88467803043146
he found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy				1128.1254981623115
yes monseigneur said d artagnan				7.779692175811915
i like said he to feel a hand like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause it seems to me said emmanuel that i see two young men down there who are evidently waiting monte cristo drew morrel a step or two behind his brother in law				1717.59101714386
you have committed a piece of folly said athos but it can t be helped there is no drawing back				676.00085684672
monte cristo poured a little iced water into a glass and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command courage haydée dried her eyes and continued by this time our eyes habituated to the darkness had recognized the messenger of the pasha it was a friend				556.1426881639994
once within the interior of the court the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty five steps				1726.2846354306798
franz albert and the count continued to descend the corso				6578.556763794289
then i must wait asked the young man				141.78547637527623
as to cocles he seemed completely bewildered				11983.750392408188
ah monsieur he was no longer a man he was a devil				573.754965306514
his soldiers formed a legion of devil may care fellows perfectly undisciplined toward all but himself				185.28730411816872
mousqueton remained glued to the door awaiting the explanation of this strange occurrence				21320.115013361374
and why asked scarron is he not a man of good birth certainly agreeable undeniably witty he has unfortunately too much wit well then why do you wish me to give up seeing such a man because he is an enemy of whom of the cardinal what answered scarron i continue to receive monsieur gilles despreaux who thinks ill of me and you wish me to give up seeing the coadjutor because he thinks ill of another man				136.45132277042714
the pharaon he cried the pharaon what what the pharaon				4974.742203987229
this announcement was received in silence				550.3775912928063
i assure your excellency said he that at least it shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things and i will take m ali as my model by no means replied the count in the most frigid tones ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities				5965.524670391202
porthos bowed as if in assent				1688.4854442010144
is the king of the spaniards never had a penny in his pocket go on sir i see what you wish to get at and if it is simply what i think that stops you i can obviate the difficulty ah i knew well said the gascon that you were a man of talent				4509.546502986324
at the other end silent scarcely visible and like a shadow was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than elsewhere				7910.606855304107
precisely so replied gaetano				226830.16925672922
at the word notary noirtier made a sign to her to stop				1107.5079366310033
there said he drawing from the casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds there are the precious studs which i have taken an oath should be buried with me				93.05926084453174
the proposal was seductive but la ramee was an old stager acquainted with all the traps a prisoner was likely to set				34087.12655856863
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you will suffer pain and you will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price yes i know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death as well as in life the only thing is to understand it you have spoken truly maximilian according to the care we bestow upon it death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse or an enemy who violently drags the soul from the body				340.9148073103089
the more reason they should be sulky with us for having captured the stuart for whom i hope you re preparing a pretty trial why said groslow that is just what we are taking him to london for and you never by any chance lose sight of him i presume i should think not indeed				963.3186174407185
i would not lose this opportunity of proving to m noirtier how wrong it would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me which i am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion and without listening to villefort he arose and followed valentine who was running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to				1494.2847491177233
and now said milady without appearing to remark the change of the duke s tone toward her now that i have received the instructions of your eminence as concerns your enemies monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine have you enemies then asked richelieu				2777.6231333387036
i can only tell you that madame de villefort sent to request my presence as she had a communication to make on which a part of my fortune depended				88728.0655190316
the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant man if those clothes had not been torn to shreds still they did not show signs of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful hands of the prisoner soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still perfect for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of a new coat				1783.3594843581282
ah pardieu continued he if it were as easy for me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours and if it were against such people you require impunity monseigneur replied milady a fair exchange				74552.53041099753
the care with which ali placed this cup on the table roused franz s curiosity				3862.3176614786134
hung by order of his highness the duc de beaufort cried the prisoner laughing violently and by master jacques chrysostom la ramee the king s commissioner la ramee uttered a cry of horror and rushed toward the gibbet which he broke at once and threw the pieces out of the window				481.635192735832
follow me then said the abbé as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by dantès				644.2139745685113
porthos wanted to follow him				30.46343259022963
you are afraid are you				64.08113732479907
his secret then was in the past as had often been vaguely said to d artagnan				54.74392881852937
my lord either with the officers of the guard with the other prisoners or with me but does he not approach the walls while playing your eminence doesn t know those walls they are sixty feet high and i doubt if monsieur de beaufort is sufficiently weary of life to risk his neck by jumping off hum said the cardinal beginning to feel more comfortable				55723.47842000865
give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and i will hand you over the money he rose gave his seat to m de boville who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the englishman counted out the bank notes on the other side of the desk				2793.9646948747686
executioner as you were of king charles				2472.1448556020528
milady possessed that great art so much studied by women of looking through her long eyelashes without appearing to open the lids				113525.84129550225
it appears to me that when about to marry your daughter to a young man it is right to make some inquiries respecting his family it is not only a right but a duty you wrote sir knowing what answer you would receive i indeed				966.262001426279
planchet is brave and shrewd they are two qualities out of the four gentlemen said aramis the principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet the most strong the most clever or the most brave the principal thing is to know which loves money the best what aramis says is very sensible replied athos we must speculate upon the faults of people and not upon their virtues				15637.286203854677
it was just two o clock by albert s watch when the two friends entered into the dancing room				191.32033414682124
listen then ah murmured caderousse what a strange priest you are you drive the dying to despair instead of consoling them listen continued the abbé				429.9736986923282
mercédès although deposed from the exalted position she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter darkness appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed				750.7643663302417
edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man and then the party lighted by the man with the torch who went first ascended the stairs				1124.635424775703
oh take it take it said the count haydée is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know ali left the room				177.88835927652386
i understand said monte cristo you wish to tell me you have hunted the lion ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions				174129.98419360662
mazarin thinking that it would be the means of increasing the zeal of his two defenders if he procured them personal thanks from the queen motioned them to follow him				36.82310837914852
you are sure it is not he said she				235.7155968875766
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my life with a perpetual companion				946.5914672249982
the beacon bathed with light the little strait through which they were about to pass and the rock where the young man stood with bare head and crossed arms				578.3550811817876
it was not whether danglars or monte cristo was more or less guilty it was a man who would answer for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a man who would fight and it was evident danglars would not fight				3625.5514527047503
now continued carlini if i have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in rita s bosom he held it out to the old man with one hand while with the other he tore open his vest				87381.7929305085
patrick soon caught the sound of his master s voice calling his falcon				122733.8461617686
what is it yesterday afternoon i received a letter from m de morcerf begging me to attend the opera and i said debray				372.10181706665315
terror seemed to have deprived them even of the power of uttering a cry				827.0640630162812
yours is a pretty business but said the agitated mercer do me the pleasure monsieur to tell me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does while i am in prison because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you of an infernal plan i swear to you monsieur commissary that you are in the profoundest error that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done and that if she has committed any follies i renounce her i abjure her i curse her bah said athos to the commissary if you have no more need of me send me somewhere				70681.24326674787
yes but they will make you then sign your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced i will supply you with the means of supporting your accusation for i know the fact well				485.14381907955
the permission to do what he liked with the carriage pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening and albert was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them				104.4540690491511
that woman was once a young girl as beautiful as she is today				1416.603926278085
i will continue then resumed aramis				111.62229348289756
the young man you speak of said villefort abruptly is a great criminal and i can do nothing for him mademoiselle mercédès burst into tears and as villefort strove to pass her again addressed him				29.725788844768218
in fact said athos this delay is not natural they took the shortest route and should have arrived before we did add to that d artagnan s rapidity in action and that he is not the man to lose an hour knowing that we were expecting him he expected you will remember to be here on the fifth and here we are at the ninth				159867.63017994337
speak one word madame and i take upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy at the first word milady turned looking at the young man with astonishment and when he had finished she said in very good french monsieur i should with great confidence place myself under your protection if the person with whom i quarrel were not my brother ah excuse me then said d artagnan				75.76465949696664
ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this evening you have only escaped from mademoiselle danglars piano to be attacked by haydée s guzla haydée what an adorable name				763.0738768430404
take it said she and be accursed athos took the paper returned the pistol to his belt approached the lamp to be assured that it was the paper unfolded it and read dec				5190.391859030828
my father howled aloud plunged his fingers into the holes which the balls had made and tore up one of the planks entire				78916.82666055679
he soon felt that his ideas became again collected he could think and strengthen his thoughts by reasoning				7854.871852693837

the king and his escort have gone this way we had better take the opposite direction eh athos did not reply he reflected				2133.567432771084
d artagnan				17.39975768118163
d artagnan stopped to look at a sideboard on which was a superb ewer of silver				2726.146987139005
they thought he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was moistened with blood				2184.8624781865888
his conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery and he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that woman and the cardinal				303.90867855128533
well fernand i must say said caderousse beginning the conversation with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy you look uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse laugh				2431.5465354786957
bertuccio said he give fifty five thousand francs to monsieur the steward left the room with a faltering step and returned with a bundle of bank notes which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for money until after he is sure it is all there				815.9572105913406
aramis started back and drew his				1320.7613514087889
but she was greatly embarrassed				13118.07951801913
and the steward followed the notary out of the room				196.29389845353523
as a result of the sympathetic devotion which jacopo had from the first bestowed on edmond the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection				2005.168147017142
i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste really				3188.1098433412526
i have seen that mother i know that from the gulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them				95.12052643854912
i have at length then intelligence of you				75.46625827207241
well laporte asked the queen				420.4502016945733
he went straight to the queen and in an altered voice said why madame have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs when you know it would give me so much gratification the queen cast a glance around her and saw the cardinal behind with a diabolical smile on his countenance				639.3677109250151
it was nearly ten o clock				983.1965596822876
my lords answered he it is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that i must repel the flash of lightning which for a moment startled me				72.50504316227085
proud of this exploit vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders and carried him to the farm				52637.363962079864
he admitted without annoyance the continued superiority of athos over himself devoid as he was of that jealousy which might have saddened a less generous disposition he was delighted also that the high qualities of athos appeared to promise favorably for his mission				1851.7575522053671
this is a woman of twenty six or twenty eight years fair said athos is she not very blue and clear eyes of a strange brilliancy with black eyelids and eyebrows yes tall well made				1211.536491769299
nevertheless he still saw grimaud with his lantern in front advancing				90377.51553239387
in twenty minutes they were on the spot named				111100.53214284805
to horse my friends to horse and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to béthune				3934.4068455276297
at the end of a quarter of an hour however surprised at the length of the journey she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted				13095.280428355703
the man who abducted my wife the cardinal rang a second time				685.2777680671726
at last about ten o clock and just as dantès began to despair steps were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment				595.6249820080712
morrel looked around uneasily				1485.0285514964773
oh sir he cried passing the bottle to porthos we are saved the bark is supplied with provisions this intelligence restored every one save athos to gayety				21068.41264236717
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights				39018.33256728076
i have done this and am monsieur with great respect your very humble and obedient servant godeau purveyor of the musketeers that s all well cried d artagnan				71.14204258113045
maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word				448.6371910330436
all this she owes to d artagnan without doubt				1239.9301963761664
on seeing them athos and aramis stood still				6788.858565520989
hold my stirrup bazin cried aramis and aramis sprang into the saddle with his usual grace and agility but after a few vaults and curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat				1102.3062499701446
the wise man my child has said it is good to think of death well if you die said she bequeath your fortune to others for if you die i shall require nothing and taking the paper she tore it in four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room				166.9748414541118
is anyone ill in the house the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from their sockets				80139.55946320215
as for the queen furious and left to her own guidance she went for the marechal de la meilleraie and desired him to take as many men as he pleased and to go and see what was the meaning of this pleasantry				16765.803041220304
but the rock was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by anyone man were he hercules himself				186.70117679061514
mercédès looked pleased and gratified while fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch				116695.59441162748
you are in a hurry said the musketeer as pale as a sheet				57265.1863865942
imposing silence grimaud put out the little night lamp then knelt down and poured into the lieutenant s ear a recital melodramatic enough not to require play of feature to give it pith				77149.17544469738
the next day the prisoner s room was full of pictures and mottoes				130497.5791285822
i am in the service of the king and queen of france and form part of the company of monsieur dessessart who as well as his brother in law monsieur de tréville is particularly attached to their majesties				76284.39995040263
from madame de montbazon he cried				1205.5949636603395
monte cristo approached him and said in a low voice with an expression almost humble sir you have indeed lost a son but villefort interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard				716.4916329415643
what is the matter				1113.3535439411453
but in this world we must risk something				5402.622582798368
i m certain of it were it not for that i should thank you for you have worked for us				356.85850657787734
monte cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies				1116.6147801195202
and the four friends guided by mousqueton took up the way toward the house already almost restored to their former gayety for they were now as athos had said all four once more united and of single mind				698.757675122338
all the delicacies in fact that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the sea a pretty silence truly said the old father of the bridegroom as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before mercédès herself				1885.4262805332257
the next moment he darted to the door and knocked down two of the soldiers who guarded it before they had time to cock their muskets				1543.4212476019022
do you know that his eminence has been making fresh complaints against your musketeers and that with so much emotion that this evening his eminence is indisposed				16963.562443305116
as for me he added with one of those singular smiles which did not escape the young man when i have completed my affairs in paris i shall go and die in the east and should you wish to see me again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan ma foi said franz it would be the easiest thing in the world for i feel eagle s wings springing out at my shoulders and with those wings i could make a tour of the world in four and twenty hours ah yes the hashish is beginning its work				1618.3541008330876
one can say anything to me				71.7639104741323
has monsieur de beaufort escaped from vincennes i do not think so my lord said bernouin but you will hear about him for la ramee is here and awaits the commands of your eminence tell him to come in said mazarin arranging his pillows so that he might receive the visitor sitting up in bed				676.2320158090293
and that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty s service				1926.5554766778641
had morrel been a more quick sighted man or better versed in these matters he would have been surprised at the king s procureur answering him on such a subject instead of referring him to the governors of the prison or the prefect of the department				10345.377910369214
it is urgent that i should have this money without delay				2281.6215993476703
no my child no said madame de saint méran but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your father my father inquired valentine uneasily				1307.5219913656574
and i also said d artagnan i also				1579.5975596920457
milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young man took for doubt but which however was nothing but observation or rather the wish to fascinate				129894.1409923192
i had sworn to die of hunger rather than part with these precious pledges but now that this ornament may be useful to him or his defenders everything must be sacrificed				64169.940346841824
then i went out of the house i proceeded to the stable and found my horse saddled and my lackey ready				1034.3488389935894
well now that would be a real fortune to us my friend let us go back to the jew s again what				614.1123774444778
god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause				2737.509875976798
see here exclaimed caderousse				185.87152227406477
i tell you valentine s life was attempted by poison four days ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of m noirtier				1809.1997790290666
no my lord be assured we shall not d artagnan thought it was now time for him to join in the conversation				563.6231598496449
these bravoes who resuscitate in our epoch the traditions of another reign are troublesome since there are two of them already there let us add a third athos was not altogether the queen s dupe but he was not a man to run away on suspicion above all when distinctly told that he should see his friends again				314.8649635793162
comte de la fere you wish to perish by his hands				478.5314848325613
i was a very insignificant person do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy everything is relative my dear young friend from the king who stands in the way of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a place				573.0484500776598
to morrow rather said de chatillon if you will take the trouble of coming so far as the gates of charenton how can you doubt it sir				834.1496086424714
at last he heard the voice of la ramee				1501.2158828054899
m franz is not expected to return home for a year to come i am told in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us				325.8055265960995
while walking near the wood of monsieur le prince i laid a few snares in the runs and while reclining on the banks of his highness s pieces of water i slipped a few lines into his fish ponds				79325.79706948822
d artagnan approached quickly making a sign to his two companions to remain a few steps behind				2527.757376522596
tell me at least the means my husband had been at liberty these two or three days				487.4482782163053
this secret which he possessed this woman whom he loved				5901.728567786535
this is all very easy for you to say replied d artagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect but for me who am without any settled means and without resources for me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet this is serious answered the three friends it is a family affair				1264.7076210116766
thus we have exchanged ideas and no one has seen us do it the devil it does				1749.8813700238502
for instance having tried every other remedy to restore movement and speech to m noirtier i resolved to try one last means and for three months i have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains				102909.86741029263
all our servants are busy discussing the grand affair				1310.764334368051
the safety of the horseman you know depends almost always upon the goodness of his horse well transfer it to me at the price it cost you i was going to make you the offer my dear d artagnan giving you all the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle how much did it cost you eight hundred livres here are forty double pistoles my dear friend said d artagnan taking the sum from his pocket i know that is the coin in which you were paid for your poems you are rich then said aramis				196.84569710218656
a ray of moonlight poured through the trees and lighted up the face of the dead				517.4514334357992
he therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden sent away barrois and after having seated himself at his father s right hand while madame de villefort placed herself on the left he addressed him thus i trust you will not be displeased sir that valentine has not come with us or that i dismissed barrois for our conference will be one which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either				19573.18989112191
i do not speak for him but for myself well sir				647.1644660117904
yes mademoiselle you especially replied the doctor abruptly				136698.7420711446
monte cristo made a sign to him to be silent				1246.730353304632
at the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening of the nearly closed door and she perceived felton who drew quickly to one side to prevent being seen by her				217.02023058510784
i know it well so take grimaud take mousqueton take bazin take planchet				657.5893864172995
show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the court and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux the waiter had no suspicions andrea spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his hands in the pocket of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all				175.3821648368339
it is not mercy then that you are about to accord sire it is justice and he is in the fort l evêque said the king				554.8326063816958
give orders to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it the steward bowed and was about to quit the room				191.33274164477308
the procureur without going to see either his wife or his daughter went at once to his study and offering the young man a chair m				705.566459565305
the cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often crossed his path and then some fine morning he will arrest d artagnan and for fear he should feel lonely he will send us to keep him company in the bastille go to				1483.3823849023865
let us go to monsieur de beaufort the two friends went to the hotel de vendome				85186.81991393036
sleep as soundly as you can tonight and tomorrow if you can we will take our departure together till tomorrow then said aramis for iron nerved as you are you must need repose the next morning when d artagnan entered aramis s chamber he found him at the window				421.8243700382301
what do you want me for sir demanded he of the paralytic				2704.885510137786
very good said d artagnan and now in what direction did they set out that i am forbidden to tell d artagnan drew from his pocket a paper				1116.3656244014371
villequier said guitant				17820.691436167835
could you let me hire a horse of you an innkeeper has always a horse to let whether it be good or bad				13068.656786985646
when the hour for his jailer s visit arrived dantès straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed place				579.9460408660996
unfortunately said monte cristo one s title to a millionaire does not last for life like that of baron peer of france or academician for example the millionaires franck poulmann of frankfurt who have just become bankrupts indeed said danglars becoming pale				754.552860224382
carriages now arrived in crowds those of the marechal de villeroy guitant villequier and comminges came into the line				1871.1356109980582
the law would seize it and put you in prison if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty the ring will be lost or a false stone worth three francs will be given you instead of a diamond worth or perhaps francs from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in purchasing caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other				400.1778315149984
franz paused for a moment				523.547991416255
he was then a more unhappy son than you morrel for he could not even find his father s grave but then he had the woman he loved still remaining you are deceived morrel that woman she was dead worse than that she was faithless and had married one of the persecutors of her betrothed				1901.162777908883
he is called bragelonne				1249.7611609297282
let us say no more on the subject you tell me so i believe you				59.520845701657336
ah is that you d artagnan and you athos said the young man				92.81999312861973
morrel i possess nearly a hundred millions and i give them to you with such a fortune you can attain every wish				1446.3635445205864
it was as if the young girl beheld the head of medusa				80604.35571307079
it was evident that this time the young woman was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the first				799.3670664959271
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and wishes to provide for the future				1374.09112360322
the king however who sought distraction while traveling as fast as possible for he was anxious to be in paris by the twenty third stopped from time to time to fly the magpie a pastime for which the taste had been formerly inspired in him by de luynes and for which he had always preserved a great predilection				196250.30442008795
and now what do you want oh how extraordinary				14085.031115120877
my lord said d artagnan monsieur de vallon is like me he prefers service extraordinary that is to say enterprises that are considered mad and impossible that boastfulness was not displeasing to mazarin he fell into meditation				136423.29569718713
if you have forgotten as he is still living i can write to him and he will send me information on the subject a cold sweat burst from the brow of milady				543.0902667424817
and in justice to villefort it must be understood that m noirtier who never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject had always omitted to explain the affair to villefort so that he had all his life entertained the belief that general de quesnel or the baron d épinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own family name or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel				2943.232303898223
you do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the king s service d artagnan colored				6927.611014643082
i inherit my father s name and i do not choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it				86.31101859603581
morrel was kinder to his wife more affectionate to his daughter than he had ever been				6254.42816444128
at other times in spite of maternal endearments or threats i had with a child s caprice been accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme terror in my mother s voice when she enjoined me to silence that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given				817.8000198343457
this village constructed in a singular and picturesque manner half moorish half spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their fathers				11418.748126786015
d artagnan still unperceived supported himself against the other side				668.0812447638663
i will swear to you by my soul s salvation my faith as a christian i have told everything to you as it occurred and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear of god at the day of the last judgment tis well said the abbé convinced by his manner and tone that caderousse spoke the truth				1440.3139453525139
m bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed				2669.803137479754
andrea was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate age he might be thirty				20229.552838756583
d artagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile				517.7950096276624
athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside and to make them a sign to come and listen with him				34.204842563254395
soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a light played over them and gilded their foaming crests with gold				1937.1388471404848
do you know what consoled him				29.081387142305314
now one of two things must happen either matters will not be arranged or they will be arranged in which last case i shall be relieved of my command and we shall still meet again sir said aramis you speak to the point				2265.4576146901477
well i fortunately recognize you				53.83366266314969
you are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer you who like ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like caliban verges on the brutal and this is called in human tongues as i tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy				15552.127788665994
the felucca is mined said d artagnan				6.877968064696887
it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristo s name announced				3448.049815343591
peste said d artagnan to porthos				46.923354279318914
a hundred thousand francs for this poor captain of musketeers to be paid whenever his services shall no longer be acceptable to your majesty anne hesitated				3278.084615580877
coquenard filled her own plate and distributed the crusts without soup to the impatient clerks				19085.273333662506
dantès observed however that faria in spite of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder one thought seemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind				687.4964981944657
i am parched with thirst				10741.959536944083
you go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me				84.74996826927794
i guessed it				59.305251979529224
i was chosen				168539.3456977712
they found the door ajar				13713.609703271515
five minutes later he was in the rue des fossoyeurs				20027.66873590089
good he said and m bertuccio left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who surrounded him				35.70936533382267
raoul turned toward the side whence the cry had sounded and shaded his eyes from the glare of the setting sun with his hand				201.5381664321174
the king wishes to get a sleep one of the two who was standing up was of gigantic size and was driving a pick with all his might into the wall whilst the other kneeling beside him was collecting the pieces of stone				1966.2384170600044
at length providence has done something for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was time i should die edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim oh my friend my friend speak not thus and then resuming all his presence of mind which had for a moment staggered under this blow and his strength which had failed at the words of the old man he said oh i have saved you once and i will save you a second time and raising the foot of the bed he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor				233565.86797219762
if we had only been looking for porthos porthos would have stationed himself in one of the finest hotels and we could easily have traced him				37.28871482045138
it is a brawl and the proof is that there were five of the cardinal s guardsmen against my three musketeers and monsieur d artagnan that is true said the king but never mind tréville come still by the back staircase tréville smiled but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon this child to rebel against his master he saluted the king respectfully and with this agreement took leave of him				36.69347350383809
d artagnan was still in deep thought when some one touched him on the shoulder				811.3004379215613
the writing of madame de chevreuse said milady to herself				2001.4942075276065
the field of battle instead therefore of being at saint denis or at charenton will be near compiegne or villars cotterets the prince will vanquish you as he has always done tis possible my lord but before an engagement ensues we shall move your eminence to another castle belonging to our friend du vallon who has three				5463.591649929803

it was in this costume and bringing back to jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him that edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard hair tangled with seaweed and body soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned				95105.56892875305

apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among men madame de villefort appeared more and more thoughtful				1986.499974420388
and how do you know it asked milady seizing both his hands and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart				361.6022646498188
grimaud looked after him and when the door was closed he drew out of his pocket a pencil and a sheet of paper				1078.2320660500652
milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty				11225.92528711635
one more turn captain twenty pistoles on one throw only one the last done for twenty replied groslow				2636.114593134132
she gave the first to athos and the other to aramis so that should they be separated by chance they might make themselves known to the king after which they withdrew				2072.1837069579396
having run against a young shopkeeper who was gaping at the crows and who had splashed him aramis with one blow of his fist had distanced him ten paces				10787.201308730831
what happened then she asked				941.5123351889897

when the chancellor appeared the king had already gone out by another door				177.94452148248376
why he imprisoned himself i swear to you he did				3374.46786053233
but if it is a woman who writes said aramis and that woman desires not to be seen remember you compromise her d artagnan which is not the part of a gentleman we will remain in the background said porthos and he will advance alone yes but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a gallop bah said d artagnan they will miss me if they fire we will ride after the carriage and exterminate those who may be in it				83.18723750887403
they fell into the line of carriages				38372.51113164035
alas it is not the death of the body i regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which everything is tending to which every unhappy being aspires is not this the repose of matter after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when faria appeared in my dungeon				4189.3766699084645
i should have feared to injure both edmond and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul				3158.4886926538256

i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the arabian nights a wizard of the middle ages but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence				2274.689865018527
the duke smiled				495.5283565982377

we shall be murdered there said aramis				28.156845071405012

dantès let go of the timber which he now thought to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them				98.58856264999122
the result was that even if the king s troops remained quietly in their camp it was evident that some day or other buckingham who only continued in the isle from obstinacy would be obliged to raise the siege				11554.461601270435
ah i confess your excellency when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle i felt my eyes filled with tears				1335.1237338865737

supposing also i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would place these two or three millions in your hands whose talent might make it realize ten per cent i never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a half but to my son in law i would give five and we would share the profits very good father in law said cavalcanti yielding to his low born nature which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it				91.56685303423997

he was a most lovely child with large blue eyes of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his hair which was too light gave his face a most singular expression and added to the vivacity of his look and the malice of his smile				559.6195379808529
how does it happen then that he is in your service he has been guilty of certain escapades and fears he may be disturbed and the musketeer narrated to his friend planchet s adventure				3202.306669108178
but amid all this he perceived with a feeling of real joy that the queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme				223.56950011231768

the celebrated breviary remained in the family and was in the count s possession				2320.7666497440105
the latter rose from the front of the window upon the sill of which he had leaned with his elbow and knitted his brow like a man disquieted				59265.53904931778
do not forget that i have been five years in the bastile and that no medium of viewing things is so deceptive as the grating of a prison ah monsieur de rochefort				713.1784804791398

they still hesitated an instant but as before pride prevailed and a second kick split the door from bottom to top				27759.667993222032
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you noirtier s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the contrary villefort s eye was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old man s heart				387.57761085146785
you seem secretly elated yes giulio she said proud and happy for i have found the means of strangling this hydra you are a great politician my queen said mazarin let us hear the means and he hid what he had written by sliding the letter under a folio of blank paper				1111.3761502863163
coquenard smiled and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took his seat				1023.8496399188784
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride				2019.7735125743195
porthos uttered a deep groan				2515.949917775766
with the first rays of day their tongues were loosened with the sun gaiety revived				5850.520371551718

she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formed a little fairy like figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her eyes dull from fatigue				2711.141766356522
pray come to my aid madame do not these circumstances appeal to your memory no indeed replied madame de villefort and yet it appears to me sir that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory perhaps the count saw us in italy said valentine timidly				3535.3800939130588

some voices passed and faded away and the sound of a single footstep approached the door				178.48916051915
one day he was surprised in a lonely road between a huguenot and a catholic with both of whom he had before had business and who both knew him again so they united against him and hanged him on a tree				3767.468298239115
athos and aramis were beginning to close their eyes which they half opened when their companion came in again				304.79045854861295

and now whenever he wishes well whenever he wishes planchet began to sing un vent de fronde s est leve ce matin je crois qu il gronde contre le mazarin				478.7174889714677
as he alighted he thought he saw his father s pale face behind the curtain of the count s bedroom				2170.9082462106185

go then and take the waters of forges or any that may be more agreeable to you and recuperate yourself as quickly as possible				897.8037950058329
in this apartment a continued buzzing prevailed from morning till night while m de tréville in his office contiguous to this antechamber received visits listened to complaints gave his orders and like the king in his balcony at the louvre had only to place himself at the window to review both his men and arms				556.6738510320893

ah yes said porthos there is nine o clock				987.0427995781984
albert placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole but he kept the faded one in his hand and when he again met the calash he raised it to his lips an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady who had thrown it but her joyous companions also				1421.352451724509
indeed indeed i did not a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast				1355.7383050553933
not to reflect on what had passed as one might fancy				15639.732107152364
perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of m de villefort but like the feudal barons who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress				15015.158958627966
our house added the englishman with a laugh does not do things in that way and you will pay ready money and the englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of bank notes which might have been twice the sum m de boville feared to lose				2037.4365593804675

rita lay between them				99.27726608406765
then there will be no blood no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act then one escapes the clutch of the human law which says do not disturb society this is the mode in which they manage these things and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance yet conscience remains remarked madame de villefort in an agitated voice and with a stifled sigh				582.8380913838929
every one grows childish in prison but the character of monsieur de beaufort was particularly disposed to become so				490.4248071286872
gentlemen said he in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances gentlemen m noirtier de villefort wishes to speak immediately to m franz de quesnel baron d épinay he as well as the notary that there might be no mistake in the person gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect				10138.190676618244
bonacieux starting				25161.995478766385
the demands in that programme must be granted we were almost agreed on those replied mazarin let us pass on to private and personal stipulations you suppose then that there are some said aramis smiling				767.102236640314
what do you say to it why that i should think it very amusing replied franz if it had happened to anyone but poor albert and in truth if you had not found me here said the count it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear but now be assured his alarm will be the only serious consequence and shall we go and find him inquired franz				623.8412442909934
why they want to know if the duke of buckingham is in paris and if he has had or is likely to have an interview with the queen d artagnan held onto this idea which from what he had heard was not wanting in probability				79878.52860148826
cromwell had sent him to mazarin				399.94548064896156

to you alone then may i confide my sorrows and my hopes the paralytic motioned yes valentine took maximilian s hand				166.81249601736027
in that case replied the abbé he should be a man blessed of god rich happy caderousse smiled bitterly				1516.3478057796663
all the artillery was ready to move and started off at a moment s notice				7221.101365685761
oh where will be the end villefort rushed into the room				186.78381125470037
i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall think for how do i know to the contrary that this house which has remained uninhabited for twenty years must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it i will come count i will be sure to come said villefort eagerly				1068.661384521374
sir said villefort in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in their oratorical periods and of which they can not or will not divest themselves in society sir the signal service which you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my thanks				3038.027738968486
all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady so rocked by them she soon fell asleep				2024.1903099511267
ah sir indeed you would inspire me with pity were you not hateful in my eyes morrel yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i will do so be satisfied				1495.3731793924815
this strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your reason				3925.8013506432067
nobody knew				8258.71177792925
made tréville the captain of his musketeers who were to louis xiii				739.7669196342724
i shall have performed a good action and my heart will be lighter and the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time				697.7328573963282
what do you mean by that you idiot asked d artagnan				14.023345364500955
pardon me sir replied the valet you had forbidden me to disturb you but the count of morcerf has called me well said albert				335.3152405645278
for example look at the puritanical procureur who has just lost his daughter and in fact nearly all his family in so singular a manner morcerf dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of benedetto besides besides what asked the count				295.1013338346493
by his manner sir and his age he s the second to day has a young man such as i am gone through this morning then asked raoul				688.6116750287792
his face had lost the expression of careless gayety it had worn like a mask the whole day				450.0796607851415
in the avenue des champs élysées				1088.7068298993531
that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere				17064.682150453675
i have sought to stifle remorse by twenty years of good deeds i have assuaged the natural ferocity of those who shed blood on every occasion i have exposed my life to save those who were in danger and i have preserved lives in exchange for that i took away				1054.2557666812077
vicomte said athos to raoul follow the duchess beg her to do you the favor to take your arm in going downstairs and thank her as you descend the fair indian approached scarron				2862.7268015575696
hush he is enjoying a ride with madame de guemenee the sergeant began to laugh				2392.559380035588
who calls richelieu calls satan hold your tongue hold your tongue madame				624.0054697219965
did i not tell you that she was the goddaughter of monsieur laporte the confidential man of the queen				410.7596425513014
the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene				3035.30840233691
one thought in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen times have plunged into the sea and thanks to his powers of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish vessel escaped to spain or italy where mercédès and his father could have joined him				34.751186674063526
the man in the mantle had kept his promise to the transteverin and there could now be no doubt that he was the count				279.3325190966051
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire				3642.4881579528637
but pursued danglars with one of his sinister smiles an order for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given				852.9330599789373
there they inquired and learned that the prince had in reality quitted bethune and stationed himself between cambria and la venthie				99693.26121434146
my english horse which has just disappeared amid a cloud of dust has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the things of the earth				1497.066203526641
it is there said felton touching the bag of money with his foot				1315.3600272737908
when the soldier saluted charles athos s heart bounded for joy and that unfortunate on coming to himself found ten guineas that the french gentleman had slipped into his pocket				1375.8337963944364
besides you can tell them that you have full confidence in me and they will not be more incredulous than you i can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days that is all to athos whose wound still makes him suffer to go to the waters of forges to porthos and aramis to accompany their friend whom they are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition				4941.911453144256
that depends when do you leave tomorrow evening at five o clock in that case i must say adieu to you as i am compelled to go to naples and shall not return hither before saturday evening or sunday morning				395.3183957647084
yes monseigneur replied the officer				1120.331016226702
well and what then said fernand lifting up his head and looking at caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger mercédès is not accountable to any person is she				1485.4648155109408
i understand bertuccio has been sent by my protector the keeper spoke for a moment with an official then opened the iron gates and conducted andrea to a room on the first floor				1306.9273314147047
monsieur d artagnan said the cardinal sitting down on a fauteuil you have always seemed to me to be a brave and honorable man possibly thought d artagnan but he has taken a long time to let me know his thoughts nevertheless he bowed to the very ground in gratitude for mazarin s compliment				8384.32065877594
villefort from his study heard the successive noises which accompany the life of a house the opening and shutting of doors the ringing of madame de villefort s bell to summon the waiting maid mingled with the first shouts of the child who rose full of the enjoyment of his age				1956.4035513694676
and this is all said she and you stopped there oh no said villefort i never ceased to search and to inquire				180492.0825993712
d artagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold				2600.0117322927417
go and promote digestion by working said the procurator gravely				4652.282238094563
this evening m coquenard is going to the house of the duc de chaulnes who has sent for him				33.851801112150255
it depends on you only i listen i am waiting to hear sir the favor i have to ask of you is not to call me mousqueton but mouston since i have had the honor of being my lord s steward i have taken the last name as more dignified and calculated to make my inferiors respect me				75.7532440970707
this chance did then for him at once more than he would have dared to ask of providence				4132.493738014728
the animal uttered a cry during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless				1147.077198690788
my lord said d artagnan advancing toward the cardinal it seems to me that your eminence is losing precious time				700.2336134795277
what would you have my dear viscount said monte cristo wiping his hands on the towel which ali had brought him i must occupy my leisure moments in some way or other				387.8072146009968
good said monte cristo to morrel who was at his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of which danglars had been the victim i have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand francs for which i would have paid a hundred thousand what have you discovered asked morrel				285.83414221534076
but he recalled the promise he had made to valentine and kept his secret				881.7087464906242
but he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the damned said felton with increasing exultation				100736.2315434762
what do you say to this mother and albert took out of a little pocket book with golden clasps a remnant of his old fancies or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door albert took out of this pocket book a note of francs				1474.225353992174
now madame i took the precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my accounts				21346.889310274382
at the first beat porthos rushed out and stood on the other side of the door				189.3853732129884
the last two mounted guard at the door during this examination then when all was over they went away leaving the house empty and exposed and porthos and aramis i could not find them they did not come but they may come any moment for you left word that i awaited them yes monsieur well don t budge then if they come tell them what has happened				1459.4156532627705
it depends on the distance he may be from the city whether he gives eight hours twelve hours or a day wherein to pay their ransom and when that time has elapsed he allows another hour s grace				6021.447984276962
i did not wish to contradict them besides i might be deceived monsieur you insult the majesty of justice not at all said athos calmly				3870.7950722972605
anne then motioned to d artagnan to approach and he obeyed				1537.930468119181
d artagnan owned nothing				596.2342239502407
my house oh your excellency it was not yours then whose then				1155.1040278935077
i do not understand you sir replied monte cristo and if i did your tone is too high				12950.074390138674
she entered the office where emmanuel was while cocles by the aid of a key he possessed opened a door in the corner of a landing place on the second staircase conducted the stranger into an antechamber opened a second door which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the house of thomson french alone returned and signed to him that he could enter				1824.6036788129275
see i have not slept said villefort showing his undisturbed bed grief does not stun me				74.85295071276113
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the president said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would use his own arms				520.4168311363005
yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition and villefort s father extended his hand to the bell rope to summon the servant whom his son had not called				3815.4750203825824
i only know it says thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s goods nor yet his wife that is a child s reason monsieur blaisois said mousqueton in his most patronizing manner				725.7149083291276
yes i was thinking whether we ought to come armed or not armed to the teeth replied mazarin				401.1935155951512
hastily snatching up the lighted candle i hurried to the staircase about midway a body was lying quite across the stairs				1128.530633805583
all that the prudent planchet had said to him the preceding evening about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of d artagnan who looked at him with more attention than he had done before				887.9645727270308
the devil thou dost not				337.6267174293043
i wish to see everything if your majesty wishes to look out well then look replied d artagnan				26.87925755731963
three days afterward the four musketeers were in paris they had not exceeded their leave of absence and that same evening they went to pay their customary visit to m de tréville				1655.6732223798786
in ten minutes luigi and the traveller reached the cross roads				72890.07224486044
but the chief president had replied with his habitual coolness without betraying either disturbance or surprise that should the agitators refuse obedience to the king s wishes he would have gallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the most active among them				93.44602839412875
let it come said athos				5.604056525323013
come porthos join me say frankly what do you think of this business nothing good replied porthos				43.2224915783946
besides the woman wore that black mantle which d artagnan could still see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of the rue de la harpe still further the man wore the uniform of a musketeer				1040.2209041123074
d artagnan alone had discovered nothing he ordinarily the most inventive of the four but it must be also said that the very name of milady paralyzed him				35.87228085321732
you said anne de bueil did you not yes yes that was her name and now absolve me for i am dying i absolve you cried the priest with a laugh which made the dying man s hair stand on end i absolve you				55.67648875478567
the soldiers then saw him stretch his limbs little by little and under the pretense of much heat throw off the scotch plaid which covered him				36.62633848947909
ah sir cried olivain what are you doing				2447.5063626648453

it is men who drive me to death it is men who make you weep yes sire said aramis yes you are right				861.963538231467
m morrel at his death left francs which were divided between my sister and myself for we were his only children				2391.3902830156744
this will has already constituted haydée heiress of the rest of my fortune consisting of lands funds in england austria and holland furniture in my different palaces and houses and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my servants may still amount to sixty millions he was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start and the pen fell from his hand				207.8756965966551
take it buy some provisions be happy and tomorrow we shall have more gently gently said the old man with a smile and by your leave i will use your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many things at a time that i had been obliged to await your return in order to be able to purchase them do as you please but first of all pray have a servant father				817.1689223778959
the union of physical pain with moral uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired				2520.6751627453914
if it was mme				162.1173175067635
we have arranged the ransom of each of them on arriving in france				567.6224024693262
he was now as we have said three and thirty years of age and his fourteen years imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance				1644.3482629145212
morcerf asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen				2734.414040751468
are you there asked porthos				15.790149575795676
in madame de villefort s room he murmured and slowly returned with one hand wiping his forehead and with the other supporting himself against the wall				1105.244172252781
help cried d artagnan stop my horse has the staggers in an instant the horse s eyes grew bloodshot and he was white with foam				112161.92872521612
no fernand you will not thus give way to evil thoughts				1062.9718642692387
be easy my dear edmond we are near the conclusion				14565.354171568591
the devil murmured d artagnan all this is vague enough				850.969287133896
the lackeys on their part like the coursers of hippolytus shared the sadness of their masters				2923.9590533772675
the prison register the day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between bellegarde and beaucaire a man of about thirty or two and thirty dressed in a bright blue frock coat nankeen trousers and a white waistcoat having the appearance and accent of an englishman presented himself before the mayor of marseilles				2572.266966466082
oh those figures how well i remember them				67.25438800325912
instead of following the knot of prisoners that were being taken into the town mordaunt turned his steps toward the rising ground from whence cromwell had witnessed the battle and on which he had just had his tent pitched				172437.4433700906
yes during the spanish war at perpignan where fernand had left her she was attending to the education of her son the abbé started				1797.9980158166618
nothing but saddles now do you understand said athos				9.407888488123612
the third attack now that this treasure which had so long been the object of the abbé s meditations could insure the future happiness of him whom faria really loved as a son it had doubled its value in his eyes and every day he expatiated on the amount explaining to dantès all the good which with thirteen or fourteen millions of francs a man could do in these days to his friends and then dantès countenance became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these times a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do to his enemies				1115.8541776412058
never forget me oh				553.8176070802045
he proceeded slowly and in deep reverie				4576.107962461435
do not leave me				44.03304968585714
i can never forgive myself monsieur said louis xviii i command you to speak well sire the usurper left elba on the february and landed on the of march and where				3039.4071616154856
sir cried she be kind be clement listen to my prayer				6956.569008800559
during the three weeks that he has been with me i have only had to reproach him with one thing being too severe with the prisoners and who is this cerberus a certain monsieur grimaud my lord and what was he before he went to vincennes he was in the country as i was told by the person who recommended him to me and who recommended this man to you the steward of the duc de grammont he is not a gossip i hope lord a mercy my lord				279.632904558325
this is not chance for chance in this case is too much like providence well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence				4234.2992594391135

i am in the hands of my enemies continued she with that tone of enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the puritans				3417.574353562615
all at once his ear caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by which he had himself ascended				62918.27985081662
she bore me rapidly away				785.1931938446157
villefort fell back on his chair passed his hand over his brow moist with perspiration and for the third time read the letter				610.1497356320327
presently the door opened and she perceived felton				946.9476651443232
i have even informed him of a circumstance i consider very serious the young man was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which				18748.411849984772
héloïse he repeated				3448.796344003439
porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting given by a lady to a cavalier or by a cavalier to a lady which had been disturbed by the presence of d artagnan and his yellow horse				910.1028588411754
the decanters broken in pieces and the fruits crushed strewed the floor				1232.5169516148337
milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation and asked d artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in england				917.2859347145012
poor dantès said caderousse				186.95284487466094
ah pardieu is that you said porthos to d artagnan				37.09625764045141
undoubtedly said villefort moderating the tones of his voice a marriage once concerted and then broken off throws a sort of discredit on a young lady then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an end to will instantly gain ground				613.8292745610314
sometimes when the cardinal always on horseback like the lowest gendarme of the army cast a pensive glance over those works so slowly keeping pace with his wishes which the engineers brought from all the corners of france were executing under his orders if he met a musketeer of the company of tréville he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner and not recognizing in him one of our four companions he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction				3125.2239953013227
i do replied athos with a deep sigh				586.9412089661397
now said aramis we know how the matter stands				3115.2405793226208
his conversation was a matter of fact without a single romance				137297.91020220847
but now i am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness since not only your letter but your servant assures me that i have the good fortune to be beloved by you				56.45290408120922
i have been here since the morning				457.08477171292975
i thought i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle ages yes no doubt but improved upon by ours				1609.1816320848031
bonacieux what is that noise that of either our friends or our enemies said milady with her terrible coolness				3800.741252456601
but if i mistake not continued he here he is you won t forget the boy sir raoul put his hand in his pocket				1362.3294852145048
yes that is true as the gospel said porthos i heard her with my own ears i also said aramis				138.84897097542887
there happened then that which you know and of which your precipitate departure added the host with an acuteness that did not escape d artagnan appeared to authorize the issue				98585.84552464866
i have but one word to add and that is to propose an example to you not mine for i myself have never appeared at court and have only taken part in religious wars as a volunteer i speak of monsieur de tréville who was formerly my neighbor and who had the honor to be as a child the play fellow of our king louis xiii whom god preserve				16695.550563837605

brunhilda and fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its infancy when man was learning to control mind were it even by an emissary from the realms of darkness				1028.252477342477
but is there anything impossible for my d artagnan the noble and loyal gentleman oh i can not believe you well read then said the unhappy young woman in the excess of her pride and joy presenting a letter to milady				492.1417124108364
i did replied the count				277.19878343404304
it seems to me that we once rendered anne of austria a service not much less than that which to day we are trying to perform for charles i but none the less anne of austria has forgotten us for twenty years well in spite of that d artagnan said athos you are not sorry that you were useful to her no indeed said d artagnan i admit even that in my darkest moments i find consolation in that remembrance you see then d artagnan though princes often are ungrateful god never is athos said d artagnan i believe that were you to fall in with the devil you would conduct yourself so well that you would take him with you to heaven so then said athos offering his hand to d artagnan				81.60673012039659
i know that i suffer that s all				179.53044624087954
whilst this terrible scene was passing at lord de winter s athos seated near his window his elbow on the table and his head supported on his hand was listening intently to raoul s account of the adventures he met with on his journey and the details of the battle				1242.3554863625347
have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the chase today a fine pleasure indeed monsieur				1069.350555368937
i shall become worthy of her gratitude but shall i likewise return worthy of your love the young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her cheeks				636.9880335443042
the cardinal wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and looked around him				31.677788558154
no but we are going to replied d artagnan pointing to grimaud who had already climbed some five or six feet from the ground				674.4180778104723
less quickly than the women it seems to me replied porthos for i madame i may say i was your victim when wounded dying i was abandoned by the surgeons				94211.23811459965
the citizens are amusing themselves in the meantime and you do you really think that anything could be done with these bourgeois yes they might do well if they had any leader to unite them in one body how miserable not to be free don t be downcast				75677.9023209893
the stranger advanced slowly and as he advanced after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp milady involuntarily drew back				728.3913207713232
andrea had spoken very little during dinner he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people amongst whom with dilating eyes he saw the king s attorney				3447.0371625773964
she asked d artagnan if he had a mistress				901.9922796195981
good said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the way you keep your word as a sailor				1706.238710412748
at this fernand recollected her threat of dying if edmond died and dropped again heavily on his seat				1093.3604177027835

patrick said groslow take this horse to the stables of the nearest inn				1182.6882578780446
from that moment he grew very guarded				6748.256739833366
the guard had in fact touched the cardinal in the tenderest point				2167.1507302270375
swear to be mute i never swear my lord i say yes or no and as i am a gentleman i keep my word come then i see that i must trust unreservedly to you believe me my lord it will be your best plan come said mazarin conducting d artagnan into the queen s oratory and desiring him to wait there				723.7219919033985

what are you about asked d artagnan				7.208495476315361

gentlemen he said when he was in his room you do not expect i presume to keep me here a long time incognito no my lord replied the gascon on the contrary we think of announcing very soon that we have you here then you will be besieged we expect it and what shall you do defend ourselves				1499.5517724189908
now by way of having a resting place during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookery which has been trying its best to poison me during the last four months while you have manfully resisted its effects for as many years and obtaining a bed on which it is possible to slumber monte cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the island and taken its name				811.1932852781971

signor pastrini came to the door to receive his guests				2721.3103501681358

while he was listening to this recital delivered with the greatest simplicity the duke looked from time to time at the young man with astonishment as if he could not comprehend how so much prudence courage and devotedness could be allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years				756.4243322256523
he added that he did not know either m or mme				142.7545617655764

dantès had tasted nothing but he thought not of hunger at such a moment he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern				3060.0891876738115

the lieutenant s entrance produced a burst of laughter in the great drawing room but he did not appear to notice that he was the object of general attention but began to arrange with so much cleverness nicety and gayety his straw bed that the mouths of all these poor creatures who could not go to sleep began to water				762.3559512329045
decidedly monsieur d artagnan you are the man i have been seeking				4827.1237530147155

the left of the carriage was as well cleared as the right and they drew up the blind of the window which mazarin less heroic than the king had taken the precaution to lower				51053.217884912134
it is done cried she wiping away her tears and resuming her firmness i am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of shame				3943.779588122435
you are laughing at me i understand				710.76298227264
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road and perceived monuments of a singular form and his mind now recalled all the details morcerf had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian way				957.6710403399483
her will be done like that of god in all things then he began to kiss one after the other those dear studs with which he was about to part				2205.341134644844

his itinerary was promptly determined he would go to dammartin from which place two roads diverge one toward soissons the other toward compiegne there he would inquire concerning the bracieux estate and go to the right or to the left according to the information obtained				6186.598417982668
soon the two gentlemen stopped also				1557.0573981535008

then the lamp was lighted and i sat down to table				629.9308468063646
thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation				50806.6740950461

valentine carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it				70.80297692315399

but this was not so easy a matter for the streets were thronged with people and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great events and at rome there are four great events in every year the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter				82119.23089726894
on the evening of the of september m morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study				2251.1195925780776

oh my beautiful sovereign a hundred times thanks oh my lord				273.16837092409605
in fact we must not dissemble that the oscillation of the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood gave him serious uneasiness				1689.3987114651875
m de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars on his left morrel				273.0600187364061
athos opened it and began by drawing forth a little note written in these terms my dear count when one travels and especially for three months one never has a superfluity of money				1020.8895188835885
you may go and offer your adieux and mine to madame de saint remy				69366.5177159497
leave me then to act and have no fears for the result at least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in case your excellency should fail none whatever				23157.270875870017
it is the longest road but certainly the most amusing d artagnan was on the point of telling athos all but one consideration restrained him				34.43805348577063
go and another sitting will accomplish what you have postponed in this charles rose and turned toward parry whom he saw pale and with his temples dewed with moisture				95907.08521886544
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage				1447.345982180732
he remembers that i saved his life and as he has a regard for his head he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his shoulders ali approached his master took his hand and kissed it				87.51000418950841

that is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear enviable				45690.28447304135
the noise became louder the horses could not be more than a hundred and fifty paces distant				6814.123092190822
dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire				55174.16425948145
you have understood me then dear monsieur d artagnan said milady				234.2081234264207
the clerks who as it appeared had smelled unusual perfumes in the house were of military punctuality and held their stools in hand quite ready to sit down				629.8927004081904
is it you said he i am here is your jailer gone yes said dantès he will not return until the evening so that we have twelve hours before us i can work then said the voice				698.2780409918212

two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets				45725.94162576873

the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano				90446.14938934156
he flattered himself he should be able to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric which he might if not killed upon the spot relate to everybody a recital which well managed would cover porthos with ridicule				4052.142829532558
with patience one must succeed				6670.107873020341
at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings				19003.36249326368
i would not go at all said aramis				28.610651470503402
his glance at first wandering fixed itself upon morrel				283.1307577770932
debray did not defend himself very warmly for the idea had sometimes crossed his mind still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of eugénie he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same thought again continually recurred and found a resting place in his heart				377.0884813299037
all four besides immediately broke off their conversation				602.9305783519044
most probably morrel and château renaud returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the chamber in well turned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written pieces but it was not the case with debray				436.96914867446236

hope faintly murmured fernand but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance				663.7374453928185
living you would feel shame at my name dead you may raise your head and say i am the son of him you killed because for the first time he has been compelled to break his word the young man uttered a groan but appeared resigned				7398.0504109325575
at this challenge vampa rose quickly drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle				107220.58237018573
fortunately he fancied that dantès was delirious and placing the food on the rickety table he withdrew				2073.3509748359506

not in the least but if i can serve you in any way i shall be delighted everything depends on you explain yourself pray monsieur said morrel recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young man the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the island of elba				2304.8330407359267
the queen stopped him				32.47919211897693
she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true mother approached valentine and took her hand				189.17976787141157
you have brought him to see me thinking to make me happy				10427.054677900262
and to all these questions poor kitty forced to put on a pleasant face responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark solely because happiness is egotistical				80503.1042995632
d artagnan bent down to his horse s neck the young man fired and the ball severed the feathers from the hat				2105.8468576188666
d artagnan alone did not seem convinced				3787.3572215671134
i saw my father s hand tremble				952.0661064161443
when we arrived about thirty paces from them the prince turned around to the soldiers comrades he said you are about to suffer a furious discharge but after that you will make short work with those fellows there was such dead silence that friends and enemies could have heard these words then raising his sword sound trumpets he cried well very good you will do as much when the opportunity occurs will you raoul i know not sir but i thought it really very fine and grand were you afraid raoul asked the count				263.28433190532013
i can answer positively on that point for the musketeers belong to our forces and monsieur de cambon the substitute for monsieur d artagnan still holds his place the two friends looked at each other				398.27455701208146
here said she you see i have thought of everything with this cloak you will not be cold but you oh i am never cold you know				971.588148571777
you were wishing just now said villefort addressing her that i were a doctor instead of a lawyer				6589.142900063979
how i have searched for him replied villefort wringing his hands how i have called him in my long sleepless nights how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men and to find mine among them				81.38010405696839
you will find it in the water you drink from the spring in the fruit you pluck from the tree but did you not say that my kind grandfather s precaution had neutralized the poison yes but not against a strong dose the poison will be changed and the quantity increased he took the glass and raised it to his lips				453.03728379050483
move on then and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded				2605.081178335974
you appear to forget yourself sadly no sir said albert coldly there are circumstances in which one can not except through cowardice i offer you that refuge refuse to admit certain persons at least what is your errand then with me sir i mean said albert drawing near and without apparently noticing cavalcanti who stood with his back towards the fireplace i mean to propose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us for ten minutes that will be sufficient where two men having met one of them will remain on the ground danglars turned pale cavalcanti moved a step forward and albert turned towards him				33.23246183912924
all this is very sad which you tell me what will you				38.91672707015782
he was thinking by himself and even seriously racking his brain to find a direction for this single force four times multiplied with which he did not doubt as with the lever for which archimedes sought they should succeed in moving the world when someone tapped gently at his door				183.6852063374
you incline me to think so said the king				379.11207685496584
do you know monsieur de tréville their captain oh yes him				28.081678137065285
sir monk said de guiche confess well that brave man and be not concerned for your expenses or for those of your mule all is paid thanks monsieur said the monk with one of those smiles that made bragelonne shudder				2657.8960917760896
is the king dead				583.6087135481928
at the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest				1192.0824242590563
run for help cried grimaud and i will remain beside him here the host quitted the room in agitation and as for his wife she had fled at the sound of her husband s cries				11540.40966221419
the fifth sharer in edmond s bequest was his own father too true too true ejaculated caderousse almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old man did die i learned so much at marseilles replied the abbé making a strong effort to appear indifferent but from the length of time that has elapsed since the death of the elder dantès i was unable to obtain any particulars of his end				747.2535361613934
the angel was a demon the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church and what did the count do the count was of the highest nobility				13673.883114678742
you do not know that every day of those fourteen years i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first day and yet i was not aware that you had married fernand my calumniator and that my father had died of hunger can it be cried mercédès shuddering				2692.205733168172
the valet de chambre appeared on the door steps				1642.2717463183074
standing before the chimney was a man of middle height of a haughty proud mien with piercing eyes a large brow and a thin face which was made still longer by a royal or imperial as it is now called surmounted by a pair of mustaches				193072.34384081626
ah those orientals they are the only men who know how to live				2109.4015188865123
have you any friend whose clock is too slow well go and call upon him in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine				5027.290317037829
oh my brother does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at francs he means that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now this i do not comprehend and yet i may not ask for an explanation madame replied monte cristo bowing				1214.7713324756721
he might have been taken for a statue				2725.4880032106475
you have seven martlets on your arms give three to your wife and you will still have four that is one more than m de guise had who so nearly became king of france and whose cousin was emperor of germany on my word i think you are right lucien said albert absently				63464.812060145865
he grew pale and red alternately and the cardinal saw at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had lost				793.3203344712658
the count laid his hand on franz s shoulder				753.2321165234608
the count s well known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice				1215.8805194400975
the fifth of october it was about six o clock in the evening an opal colored light through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue ocean				1372.1981942493674
at this unusual sound a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society				5487.015965781875
beware my lord you are in the hands of god in the hands of the devil you mean cried buckingham raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people without absolutely shouting				122553.490610459
he was coming here to hasten her marriage with franz ah indeed so franz must wait				3867.9758104159887
you suit me very well baptistin bowed low				3191.9217647726587
when you please replied beauchamp allow me only to compliment m de morcerf who has given proof today of rare chivalric generosity oh yes said château renaud				1943.1883464046148
danglars asked for a knife and fork				14623.797758475044
the musketeers who had already discovered who mazarin was followed in profound silence				512.8491007453572
yes monsieur we are cousins said porthos without being disconcerted as he had never reckoned upon being received enthusiastically by the husband				845.3101954851697
oh queen				305.42842108358957
he then began pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air glancing from time to time at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his place on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried				60096.445663108934
madame de morcerf had lived there since leaving her house the continual silence of the spot oppressed her still seeing that albert continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from her eyes seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding light without warmth				119641.15409784367
d artagnan has conquered her her that invincible power of evil				1652.6427919265827
meanwhile the soldiers whose duty it was to remain in the king s room attracted by that love of play so powerful in all men had stolen little by little toward the table and standing on tiptoe lounged watching the game over the shoulders of d artagnan and porthos				194.49226972179366
the cardinal therefore rose to open it				80.35348859508186
with his instinctive delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and faria had been equally silent				1258.5461425683175
it is dangerous to go to war with a nation				8260.822848207275
come hither i say and don t be afraid continued athos				65.77662387303053
the only thing that astonished d artagnan was that his friends had never thought of this				741.8921004872554
no false generosity count				221.14803550069044
in a moment you didn t forget my purse no be easy good porthos and mousqueton each took a horse by the bridle and proceeded to their post				2198.7680052901364
take something mme				71.85831622583352
if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view				2502.5682044672412
she still had her rich fair hair her large animated intelligent eyes so often opened by intrigue so often closed by the blindness of love				936.5805830185293
it is all in beginning				15226.253263294879
d artagnan entered after the cardinal and behind d artagnan the door was guarded				7103.79453110292
this is not his writing said athos				5.996911021069548
d artagnan keeping at some distance from his friends darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared but saw no face with which he was acquainted				2673.008081951049
this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano was the bill of fare				9103.403009714708
now i repeat my father is named m de villefort and i am ready to prove it there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the manner of the young man which silenced the tumult				3975.6474182924267
oh how i love you said buckingham				11791.300607880696
bassompierre and schomberg were marshals of france and claimed their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king but the cardinal who feared that bassompierre a huguenot at heart might press but feebly the english and rochellais his brothers in religion supported the duc d angoulême whom the king at his instigation had named lieutenant general				1369.7904666162685
i hear she said that paris is not quiet				11109.856846381921
let m de rochefort enter said mazarin eagerly on hearing their names pronounced and beg m d artagnan to wait i shall have further need of him these words gave great joy to d artagnan				64.81091172175708
see gentlemen said m de beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what i ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his answer				859.0260895437314
athos had a noble heart and made therefore but a poor courtier				9514.108146386996
as he stooped down to drink he saw that his hair had become entirely white				119087.5767999029
this time kitty was nowhere waiting for him neither in the antechamber nor in the corridor nor beneath the great door				180.47098051281708
in the meantime the fugitives had returned to the first room where they took counsel together				606.4005844844363
so then they have paid my ransom no your excellency well then how am i free a person to whom i can refuse nothing has come to demand you come hither yes hither really				3861.5847357906123
at length with the help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench and found himself on his feet				813.1777081597288
she only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm the fair round arm of a woman but twenty five years old and who yet spread death around her				218.1267951478803
parry for his part will raise this slab of marble and a passage will be opened oh juxon said the king seizing the bishop s two hands in his own promise that you will pray all your life for this gentleman and for the other that you hear beneath your feet and for two others also who wherever they may be are on the watch for my safety sire replied juxon you shall be obeyed meanwhile the miner underneath was heard working away incessantly when suddenly an unexpected noise resounded in the passage				862.0675316139548
he came up with her before she had traversed a third of the street				1176.2189030002462
she made no effort to remove her lips from his kisses only she did not respond to them				93.13952383497052
more than half an hour passed before any one could make himself heard				713.678558623595
she saw vaguely the future but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her ideas as yet confused a distinct form and a regular plan				1175.3661367990485
this time the jailer might not be as silent as usual but speak to dantès and seeing that he received no reply go to the bed and thus discover all				187.71284016261637
debray rose smiling and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter point when the door opened suddenly				3525.7605401986016
i do not know you i am said i the little abbé who reads lives of the saints and translates judith into verse ah ah				556.0124953614232
sire it is something more opaque than the fog indeed said winter it appears to me like a bar of red color it is the enemy who have made a sortie from newcastle and are surrounding us exclaimed athos				119.39084409674052
avanti said the same sharp and imperative voice				700.409599523784
upon arriving at her hotel franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the contrary her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly to astonish the servants				6531.210198895817
he had often heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly devoured too much food				1667.957982837539
the bell summoned him to his seat and he entered the orchestra with château renaud and beauchamp				750.545306978906
ere long the door opened and the marechal entered followed by the coadjutor				1260.1086279943352
the place royale be it so replied athos				5.715684206152497
the president resumed i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha				50527.1933501254
i am lost was his second thought and indeed for a man in andrea s situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and death death without mercy or delay				2255.744325428778
on his side however great franz s desire was to allude to their former interview the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him and his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it				87.67364739402223
ah i remember athos is at monsieur de tréville s but where are you going monsieur where are you going i am going down by the window in order to be there the sooner cried d artagnan				80.49296308193999
ali was on the box in whom franz recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo				358.09296010733925
no but franz has for heaven s sake not a word of this before him				35.056166164923674
what is it said the musketeers				695.0080150822383
oh yes certainly a speedy violent death would be a fine means of deceiving these remorseless enemies who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance				2816.6340817496234
monsieur d artagnan murmured raoul				517.1583892414652
you may perhaps have hidden a thought but not a step not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me				89.69595099727059
the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the morning only by the count s orders in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their heads had been fastened a large diamond				1451.1163339428094
he found beauchamp pacing the room on perceiving him beauchamp stopped				1590.8383650983335
two days will be a different thing said danglars smiling				812.0005663182119
planchet and fourreau as pale as death were trying to give him succor but it was plain that all assistance was useless all the features of the dying man were distorted with agony				3416.205741463188
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take part in the noise and confusion				4086.893045248813
d avrigny and villefort laid him on a couch				50959.287596399576
edmond continued she you will see that if my face is pale if my eyes are dull if my beauty is gone if mercédès in short no longer resembles her former self in her features you will see that her heart is still the same				1133.8074122577082
the others withdrew				2490.4306683638383
ma foi i beg your pardon but as i have but one son and it is the first time i have ever thought of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know come i will reform and morcerf with a forced smile arose and making a low bow to m danglars said baron i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugénie danglars for my son the vicomte albert de morcerf but danglars instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner which morcerf had expected knit his brow and without inviting the count who was still standing to take a seat he said monsieur it will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer to reflect said morcerf more and more astonished have you not had enough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed since this marriage was first discussed between us count said the banker things are constantly occurring in the world to induce us to lay aside our most established opinions or at all events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of circumstances which may have placed affairs in a totally different light to that in which we at first viewed them i do not understand you baron said morcerf				744.081927170326
who are you madame said the count to the veiled woman				418.3673134574371
but before madame de villefort could reach her friend the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars i must speak to you when tomorrow where in my office or in the court if you like that is the surest place i will be there at this moment madame de villefort approached				1879.782471763774
with this luigi purchased books and pencils				48526.23078872916
immediately and according to custom the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators it is always an event at marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the pharaon has been built rigged and laden at the old phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city				1010.9173185615152
come now that we are alone said athos let us talk of yourself whilst we are alone let us speak of ourselves replied de winter				607.5835105255612
at the noise they made she in overturning the furniture in her efforts to get at him he in screening himself behind the furniture to keep out of her reach kitty opened the door				179.3305801198493
i shall have to watch the men who pick up balls the duke smiled				506.12890096517657
if i am an officer your fortune is certain for i shall have money enough for both and moreover a name we shall both be proud of since it will be our own				974.3435235940165
it is not a man then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the point of returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good say not so quickly returned monte cristo say not so my friends angels never err celestial beings remain where they wish to be				875.3826141956633
you can not for a moment imagine d artagnan that i would commit such an offense toward the unknown giver interrupted d artagnan				71.94468090188285
it is you bernouin she said				275.9730328812989
her face is very pale and i have listened in vain i do not hear her breathe you are right said felton after having looked at milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her				170.14776265110578
there said he it s done				1375.288072153988
in the streets the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes gigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes heads bellow from men s shoulders dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callot s temptation of st anthony a lovely face is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends				80998.66237397683
are you mad emmanuel				1162.0810237388027
why the good god sends him back again caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair				696.9258495342507
i quit the world then i make a sacrifice				4060.107496879089
he remembered those interesting stories so little believed in paris respecting roman bandits he remembered the adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that he should marry mademoiselle eugénie				1825.1240362211652
but at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit and applauded himself for having put it in action an inhabitant of la rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines god knows how such was the watchfulness of bassompierre schomberg and the duc d angoulême themselves watched over by the cardinal an inhabitant of la rochelle we say entered the city coming from portsmouth and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days				482.71811428057936
be calm exclaimed athos for heaven s sake				7467.466911501092
oh heavens exclaimed monte cristo can my suspicions be correct				245465.00069913836
he had been known in the circle of the musketeers to win in one night three thousand pistoles to lose them even to the gold embroidered belt for gala days win all this again with the addition of a hundred louis without his beautiful eyebrow being heightened or lowered half a line without his hands losing their pearly hue without his conversation which was cheerful that evening ceasing to be calm and agreeable				4213.815013714
yes said grimaud with his hair standing on end				743.3102699107492
what the devil my dear do you think you can wear a star from heaven on your finger and nobody observe it				81.06646663466995
i understood from edmond that she was the daughter of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated oh replied caderousse did he know so little of his lovely betrothed				2041.246554028035
she terminated it by an action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation this was a blow with her fan applied with such force that the little feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces				2526.6848616251455
you have assassinated a woman then cried the monk				1616.7929509677974
there she must always be and to marry mademoiselle danglars would be awful you are difficult to please viscount yes for i often wish for what is impossible what is that to find such a wife as my father found monte cristo turned pale and looked at albert while playing with some magnificent pistols				1001.081670347814
when are you to be married i will tell you all said valentine from you i have nothing to conceal				7696.130712583189
oh not the least in the world madame				680.2769795789885
dantès turned and perceived that they had got out to sea				648.3947561459172
what will they leave him				29.030096473702674
ah said monte cristo taking it from her hand				184.5332574254364
you will allow me to leave first then after half an hour you can go away in your turn yes monseigneur				3612.022982311085
this instant sir this instant i beseech you said the old lady				3259.0389232279695
athos who still suffered grievously from his wound though it had been dressed anew by m de tréville s surgeon was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand his feather even touching the ground				614.9935536543098
but since you say nothing remains but for m d épinay to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following day you will be his tomorrow you will be engaged to m d épinay for he came this morning to paris valentine uttered a cry				808.6250920372534
but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which dantès handled the helm				15368.843936216026
and yet in all this the cardinal had not yet said a word about the duke of buckingham				1044.7932788643384
her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl of her age				1980.6263333181867
for what reason is all this fume and fury asked athos				62.52841358916587
from blois to paris was a journey of four days for ordinary travelers but d artagnan arrived on the third day at the barriere saint denis				4667.1424531649345
i recognize you perfectly the poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty was behind the rampart of that pure brow behind those brilliant eyes in which she read nothing but interest and compassion				24099.73885599808
the young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so opportunely				141797.0515164968

and as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the rhône from which it had its source and the post road it had depleted not a hundred steps from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description				5681.230980446792
it would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the costume of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento				93194.30934762114
madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added we thought this news would possess an interest for you sir who have always entertained a great affection for valentine it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is destined				66157.80834187965
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed				58064.0054755534
but then all this extravagance is not for myself added athos laughing				1444.111425863542

pronounce one single word muttered d artagnan and you are a dead man the coachman perceived at once by the expression of the man who thus addressed him that he had fallen into a trap and he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes portentously staring				83476.80000780082
if he wanted valentine he closed his right eye only and if barrois the left				810.135671095855
fine vengeance that on my faith a cold sweat broke from d artagnan s brow				436.71377013538773
well i hope you will make a handsome wedding present the day you marry mademoiselle danglars i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head what fortune has she but i tell you a million andrea shrugged his shoulders				876.4134007256458
well then i should say for instance resumed danglars that if after a voyage such as dantès has just made in which he touched at the island of elba someone were to denounce him to the king s procureur as a bonapartist agent i will denounce him exclaimed the young man hastily				6954.877467684788
spur spur and he fired two pistols				972.8885446115606
at auteuil near paris m de villefort a second time raised his head looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa and became livid				2626.966990549761
bear witness that we have done all that we could that shall be testified to rest assured				5579.6568278598215

hullo said albert it is monte cristo and his greek the strangers were indeed no other than the count and haydée				4526.177560486632
the invalid s eye remained fixed by which expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable				60118.34300233962
he answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the head				383.79315928346335
the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary				1743.5746216261407
you arrive in good time dear d artagnan said aramis and by taking part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence				6695.747774807892
come d artagnan said porthos bid adieu to your sword and go with me to pierrefonds to bracieux or to du vallon				4921.095792069439
this man who was hastening towards the wood was already three quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest				1142.856910741966
then wait said aramis and with the terrible coolness which on important occasions he showed he took one of the muskets from tony shouldered and aimed it at the young man who stood like the accusing angel upon the rock				2424.696884851906
d artagnan charged with a party of musketeers up the rue du coq and the portion of the mob he assailed disappeared like smoke dispersing near the place saint germain l auxerrois and taking the direction of the quays				70390.51028428148
cavalcanti continued danglars is about to marry you and will place in my hands his fortune amounting to three million livres that is admirable said eugénie with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out one upon the other				394.5304875368917
lean a little to the left				847.6670317191914
in that case i can comprehend the length of the conversation felton started and milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted puritan				3915.6870554583647
the opportunity was good				1275.6191442442364
oh yes it is she a voice of strange sweetness how do you know it the executioner raised himself on his elbow and gazed with a frightened air at the monk who became livid				2629.2139263488643
felton let me die well then we will live and die together cried he pressing his lips to those of the prisoner				1182.2879213570823
who could know that i was here already said the young man				100.72075587043595
d artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just as if his horse and he had been made of iron				5688.186585437357
they explained what had occurred that evening				536.1238389247251
in the first place you have plenty of money haven t you				54.75437139015763
you were still fast asleep and i did not know what to do with myself i was still stupid from our yesterday s debauch				178211.25387236648
the substitution was made so carefully that my spies if i had any could have no suspicion of it				80.94108792651774
until one of us dies repeated monte cristo moving his head slightly up and down				637.4656911393175
ah sir he exclaimed it was you				72.90018015178732
andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances				782.7200051769873
now m danglars ask these gentlemen where they are caught sterlets said château renaud are only found in the volga and said cavalcanti i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size exactly one comes from the volga and the other from lake fusaro impossible cried all the guests simultaneously				20619.14350743726
nevertheless aramis was in a good situation and able to defend himself				181.44031936394668
now where will it be agreeable to you that we hold our conference inquired aramis perceiving that people were stopping to look at them supposing that they were going to engage in one of those far famed duels still extant in the memory of the parisians and especially the inhabitants of the place royale				3894.5484881536263
we are going to rejoin that good fellow porthos				82.86580563997771
then i forgive you said the man dropping his cloak and advancing to the light				1141.1894710955467
mousqueton duly instructed was put at the head of this sudden and new business				2411.354351047349
be easy kitty there is something between that man and me that he is quite ignorant of he nearly made me lose my credit with his eminence				1897.9327851583216
you are not angry with me not the least in the world till then then till then bonacieux kissed his wife s hand and set off at a quick pace				3360.2543765477044
monsieur d artagnan is my tenant although he does not pay me my rent and even better on that account ought i to know him				35.91778395975106
well your majesty said he you see how far my enemies go they menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me				73.80436141365313
the count s eye expanded he knew albert had insulted the count dreadfully and that in every country in the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel				3067.7125867319064
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate				2101.2779360763257
chapter lviii				8752.186134723539
what said he you have just lost one woman whom you call good charming perfect and here you are running headlong after another d artagnan felt the truth of this reproach				153832.66223776675
athos my friend and the two gentlemen were for an instant locked in each other s arms then athos looking into his friend s face and taking him by both hands said what ails you my lord				292.6842300056424
can my influence with them be of any service to you oh count you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless				56960.607069903315
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the cellar				3782.729588433445
madame de lannoy whom according to your majesty s command i have frequently interrogated told me this morning that the night before last her majesty sat up very late that this morning she wept much and that she was writing all day that s it cried the king to him no doubt				1209.8882644087662
these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five minutes the malady will reach its height and in a quarter of an hour there will be nothing left of me but a corpse oh exclaimed dantès his heart wrung with anguish				6101.008788309171
the day after that you received a visit from cavois resumed the cardinal				251.35875412448655
quite quite alone replied the man or at least practically so for my poor wife who is the only person in the house besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor thing you are married then said the priest with a show of interest glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment				640.963887659113
your doors are guarded the airholes of your cellars are guarded and i could say to you as that good la ramee said to me of the duc de beaufort you must be either bird or mouse to get out he did get out nevertheless do you think of escaping in the same way i am a prisoner then parbleu said mazarin i have been proving it to you this last hour and he quietly resumed his dispatch at the place where he had been interrupted				16220.98866552766
at a few minutes to seven returned the duke suiting the action to the words i raise the crust of the pie i find in it two poniards a ladder of rope and a gag				8185.6237793333485
directly afterwards the moon rose				1384.6397893050041
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill joined planks of the door he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to danglars				602.5509108326785
he shouted again				240.6130543769183
in a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post boy and horses which were harnessed and put in the post chaise in a minute while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap				66797.17097776114
at the sound of the fireworks the carriages instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent streets				2824.797014486135
athos recognized his comrade and phlegmatic as he was he burst into a laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his eyes petticoats falling over his shoes sleeves tucked up and mustaches stiff with agitation				3394.0974815602654
come monsieur bazin make yourself easy said d artagnan people of all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven monsieur was already such a good theologian said bazin almost weeping he might have become a bishop and perhaps a cardinal well but my poor bazin reflect a little				978.077707864187
dantès ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces he listened he groped about but he heard and saw nothing the cries had ceased and the tempest continued to rage				1469.735335641253
for pity s sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressing for pity s sake do not call assistance				3861.886728521588
athos and aramis entered last and locked the door behind them				98.00786414835562
the ranks closed firmly in and a kind of majestic tremor ran from man to man				138.87082144962224
at the top of the stairs upon the most conspicuous door of the corridor was traced in black ink a gigantic number d artagnan knocked and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside he entered the chamber				550.8092126089782
come said d artagnan all this leads to nothing				710.419063532288

villefort drew back and clasping his hands together exclaimed dead so suddenly a week ago continued madame de saint méran we went out together in the carriage after dinner				2102.582902677757
it was the portrait of a young woman of five or six and twenty with a dark complexion and light and lustrous eyes veiled beneath long lashes				104246.33924887382
peste i thought you somewhat corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward but i see you have other strings to your bow				2465.136171565312

and this is the reason monsieur continued maximilian of my sister and brother in law having only francs a year maximilian had scarcely finished his story during which the count s heart had swelled within him when emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat				1775.8317661706908

s blood does that astonish you and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however did not exclude a certain degree of method				237192.41500563704
at that moment a hand touched his shoulder				759.6300766142417
yes here it is who is this athos one of my friends but if he should be at home and see me he is not at home and i will carry away the key after having placed you in his apartment but if he should return oh he won t return and if he should he will be told that i have brought a woman with me and that woman is in his apartment but that will compromise me sadly you know of what consequence				32653.560612467692
