d artagnan remained for a moment motionless asking himself where he could be but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same aperture the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once respectful and refined and the word majesty several times repeated indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen s apartment				744.2625452973781
edmond it is not madame de morcerf who is come to you it is mercédès mercédès is dead madame said monte cristo i know no one now of that name mercédès lives sir and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your voice edmond by the simple sound of your voice and from that moment she has followed your steps watched you feared you and she needs not to inquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes m de morcerf fernand do you mean replied monte cristo with bitter irony since we are recalling names let us remember them all monte cristo had pronounced the name of fernand with such an expression of hatred that mercédès felt a thrill of horror run through every vein				20951.898682418177

here they are monseigneur there was a moment of silence which proved that the cardinal was employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note or else in writing it				94.96711683047872
as danglars approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a look of deep meaning while fernand as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his countenance and a nervous contraction distort his features while with an agitated and restless gaze he would glance in the direction of marseilles like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event				4377.84831200667

all his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his voice also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning noirtier cast an appealing look on valentine which look was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately				1322.2465964166086
the confusion of his mind the terror which spurred him on the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him and the hooting of the people who notwithstanding the early hour were going to their work only made him precipitate his course				1807.5855370327554

egad cried aramis you set me thinking				32533.081440283626
it was the signal of a visit				1520.8032713759023
athos fell on his knees and remained some minutes as if bewildered or stunned				78630.22781134975
aramis smiled and drew from his vest a cross of diamonds which was hung around his neck by a chain of pearls				10518.781615571748

all london was crowding to the doors of the house				440.70010104693023
but there the confidence of d artagnan stopped				1062.272621371167
perhaps some of these days i may be entrapped like poor peppino and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of prison briefly what did you learn that two executions of considerable interest will take place the day after tomorrow at two o clock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals				449017.11506361724

the two interlocutors thus separated taking opposite directions at full gallop				1469.2007038707823
danglars hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for				1032.747128542948
so much the better				1022.1920471140917
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report morcerf s adventure had made in the world for the affair at the opera was generally known				2601.470125032973

albert had proceeded no farther than the door where he remained rooted to the spot being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first time and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate idea				2825.959687235838
the result was that the two men communicated with one another how long they did so nobody knows				4690.572924949474
come hither monsieur d artagnan who understood that it was to him this compliment was addressed approached assuming a most deprecating air				915.0766877710554

a letter from the king perhaps				2636.5583505596146
i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview				5318.746017886583
the man in the mask stopped before a low door and drew out a key but before he placed it in the lock he turned around to see if he was being followed				8026.664108067061
it s a month now that you have been thinking of this marriage and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my house you met this young cavalcanti whom i do not really know at all but i do have you made inquiry is there any need of that				589.1434714353613
they went out				321.76312296691384
he saw d artagnan and porthos enter with internal pleasure yet showed no joy in his countenance				1177.5752948942475
all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door of signor pastrini s the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting				22671.456730551312
you were right my lord said felton with a tone of profound disgust which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of milady you were right my lord and i was wrong and both again left the room				188.06341371542223
a square table covered with books and papers upon which was unrolled an immense plan of the city of la rochelle occupied the center of the room				203.8812638773582
well said the prisoner when the door was shut i am not so far advanced as i believed				35114.37304889798
then he drew from his waistcoat pocket the little emerald box raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her hand				299.36654910840934
what is that noise demanded milady				277.3522853677215
i had announced you beforehand to my friends as an enchanter of the arabian nights a wizard of the middle ages but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence				4648.038193773745
for his death the death of your prince yes how so because he has made his will in my favor indeed on my honor for how much for five hundred thousand only that				697.4521109131549
i opened my eyes astonished to find myself alive and even unhurt a third of the squadron were lying on the ground wounded dead or dying				3252.3727416825204
d artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke would slacken his pace but it was not so				568.2051691738118
i thought that we were finally quit of monsieur de beaufort yes you saw only the torrent that threatened to overturn everything and you gave no attention to the still water				1863.8851825354097
i entreat you continued villefort				252.40102983154992
now when evening came dantès put his plate on the ground near the door the jailer as he entered stepped on it and broke it				96.9539298944814
the baron might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance				5909.90092327469
and you porthos do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw from it				98.0709283139266
very pretty but to the great astonishment of d artagnan the shutter remained closed				2051.9413305509306
oh returned she it was a gift of heaven				914.2606548985908
neffer neffer d artagnan seeing athos rise did likewise took his arm and went out				457.03791378913337
her eyes however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire				22247.776896952917
morrel horrified supported his head with one hand and with the other pressed his heart lest its beatings should be heard				1488.3540452961167
as soon as she heard the cannon which announced the fatal event she had ordered the anchor to be weighed				180715.81888745338
franz and albert were like men who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present				3426.2909149983725
the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators the balconies of the two churches at the corner of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed the steps even seemed a parti colored sea that was impelled towards the portico every niche in the wall held its living statue				3253.666409614237
well inquired d artagnan				5.08850765617605
suddenly the jailer entered				546.0783744500078
dantès cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves				2282.720705573367
the prisoners then approached and formed a circle				28820.65122297147
go on sir said he				7.199548641255004
they understood then from the few words which escaped from d artagnan what affair was in hand and as they thought that overtaking his man or losing sight of him d artagnan would return to his rooms they kept on their way				695.8761768419889
but why has he waited till now				1044.9208248910206
thanks to the sale of his horse he commenced his career with four more crowns than m de tréville possessed at the commencement of his				1622.0941738301515
today the preliminaries tomorrow or next day the ceremony				5637.374109479826
you can understand that a man who has such views will never allow himself to be taken or if taken will undergo martyrdom rather than speak very well said d artagnan i consent to bazin with all my heart but grant me planchet				823.2223368797466
the cardinal therefore got up perfumed himself dressed and went to the queen to tell her what had detained him				69.09001457590195
the morrels have been shipowners from father to son and there was a morrel who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence pardieu and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted				41248.021896323415
i am no longer astonished that you knew me not				465.6576637455935
may i be hanged said danglars glancing at the bandit s dinner through the crevices of the door may i be hanged if i can understand how people can eat such filth and he withdrew to seat himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy				117077.94271893858
then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this was the remembrance of the cardinal				321.62276640729425
see answered the voice				519.3424418966329
there is only one thing which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon ah my dear m cavalcanti i trust you will not leave before i have had the honor of presenting you to some of my friends i am at your service sir replied the major				2169.5691497664416
at this moment grimaud came in				938.0215171951646
upon my word you did well to come back nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start it s the mistral said caderousse and it will be sure to last till tomorrow morning he sighed heavily				10606.711993912926
edmond replaced on the table the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couch he did not wish to die				1741.598670145318
stop and the sergeant who began to see that he was the victim of an artifice was almost in a frenzy of despair				2049.122420683461
gentlemen he said turning to those who were near him can any one of you speak spanish and serve me as interpreter i can my lord said raoul				890.096903845521
he sees us on the road which leads him to a bishopric and perhaps will not be sorry to get us out of his way ah as regards aramis that is another thing said porthos and it wouldn t surprise me at all perhaps monsieur de beaufort will try in his turn to lay hands on us nonsense				3799.4402189017774
grimaud alone was calm as ever				1644.408638672071
the citizens always took up arms readily against thieves wolves or scoundrels often against nobles or huguenots sometimes against the king but never against the cardinal or spain				9138.16119717695

d artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot where the rue d assas is now situated breathing the balmy emanations which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard and which arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze of night				1167.981296826035
ah me				56.78422055901729

they both went into the house the drawing room was lighted up they went in there				951.4207649655966
name to me such of your workmen as you need and point out the tools they must bring the goldsmith knew the duke				1114.637440772175
when they met they looked desolately at one another as much as to say have you found anything however as porthos had first found an idea and had thought of it earnestly afterward he was the first to act				2319.9456771796335
let us hear				161479.29141484378

it might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken language did not exist or had become useless				2395.257896605555
what are you thinking of this evening bertuccio sprang out and offered his shoulder to the count who this time leaned upon it as he descended the three steps of the carriage				1389.8801631373617
anne of austria believed that louis xiii				933.2424320733361
as to m de boville he was in such a state of despair that it was evident all the faculties of his mind absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past				2818.2354831598554
this must be then an affair of importance and what is the most important affair to a woman of twenty five				6497.940816396412
d artagnan had run sword in hand through all the neighboring streets but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for				1092.294245797546
he bowed politely to the baroness familiarly to danglars and affectionately to monte cristo				395.2409288282708
he drank to their good health and the travelers returned his politeness				4400.783231743134
will he be at home at eight o clock this evening doubtless unless he is at work which is the same as if he were out i will come again at that time replied the visitor who then retired				763.9826170198966
what he is that is quite another thing				1567.6712778898034
the prisoners were then to make their way through one of the gallery windows and to let themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé s ladder of cords				18235.20860237026
your interview will be private				543038.2692389966
but d artagnan had reckoned without the wind				3428.144125721005
it was now cromwell s turn to look fixedly at mordaunt and mordaunt to make himself impenetrable				237663.38694481316
buckingham threw himself at her feet and before the queen could prevent him kissed the hem of her robe				19381.68184021886
it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl s mind as to the reality of the scene her eyes started with terror her hands trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her				257.5120199986154
i m beginning to feel queer cried blaisois				1446.6863507228443
what was the matter with you baron d artagnan said to him as they descended the staircase of the palais royal				1230.6752707614764
it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the the francs of m de boville and on the the francs of bills for which as well as the debt due to the inspector of prisons he had time granted he must be a ruined man				220.4013307627091
the heart of d artagnan swam in delirium he marched between athos and porthos pressing them tenderly				7008.903859826291
the instant groslow put his foot upon the hatchway steps the ship opened like the crater of a volcano				388409.63671843754
wherefore did you not apply then madame to the first person you saw from us such is the hospitality shown to a queen by the minister from whom a king demands it but i heard that a marriage between the prince of wales and mademoiselle d orleans was spoken of said de winter				958.1177512612904
among these two hundred levees that of tréville was one of the most sought				5269.539908004536
as the last stroke died away the count thought he heard a slight noise in the dressing room this first sound or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the count knew what to expect				4385.930293197169
in fact in addition to that yellow sickly paleness which indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood and which might besides be accidental d artagnan remarked something perfidiously significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance				1172.8713861882927
but why should i meddle in the matter				501.31259224777745
has bedeau been killed				2143.5629781500074
he turned towards his wife				1067.8046188636963
the procureur then told his wife to come up				1010.9992691830554
have you so soon changed your mind added morcerf or have you only provoked my request that you may have the pleasure of seeing me humbled danglars seeing that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it the whole thing might turn out to his own disadvantage turned to morcerf and said count you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me these are all so many empty words my dear sir said morcerf they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de morcerf does not rank in that list and when a man like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted word and this man fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing danglars was a coward but did not wish to appear so he was piqued at the tone which morcerf had just assumed				67446.05718419382
are you out of your senses or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me				107.99542357584917
he has made up his mind to take a wife from paris a fine idea that of his said danglars shrugging his shoulders				1258.2587171641096
the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends and athos advancing a few paces in front of the others cried in a firm voice who goes there who goes there yourselves replied one of the horsemen				1143.0471164360797
where is the key you speak of here it is ah my lord				637.8217362754598
it will be remembered that monte cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf and although debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and manner of the count consequently the description given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination				2829.2670940697067
de chevreuse had been in paris but still further that the queen had renewed with her one of those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a cabal when he affirmed that he the cardinal was about to unravel the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue that at the moment of arresting in the very act with all the proofs about her the queen s emissary to the exiled duchess a musketeer had dared to interrupt the course of justice violently by falling sword in hand upon the honest men of the law charged with investigating impartially the whole affair in order to place it before the eyes of the king louis xiii				1050.389505775226
jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was				1060.4623040962206
d artagnan looked at porthos				166.79682690120498
to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor this answer was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments				84270.19506784632

she traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage				9221.082019925383
could you have been so cruel as not to bring her calm yourself				1676.0031428003597

and if death be my lot i hope to die for the king for royalty and for god				556.4381877430993

his majesty king louis xiii				981.8041996436907
but athos porthos and aramis quickly appeared in their turn and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young companion drove them back				1258.8360346663223
the young girl is lovely and her tears only embellish her the lady appears to be about forty years of age the girl about fourteen				267184.6079841702
royalty payments must be paid within days following each date on which you prepare or are legally required to prepare your periodic tax returns				33381.59703979238
i heard the chevalier d herblay say so the fool cried blaisois i wish i had been in his place thou canst be said grimaud writing down his figures				11520.308600246583
at one of these encounters accidentally or purposely albert s mask fell off				1244.9457917039988
the inspector visited one after another the cells and dungeons of several of the prisoners whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government				12876.307868189857
i pretended that i disliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife s father and mother should pass into the hands of strangers				11992.862445092735
although the day had been fatiguing neither of them was inclined to sleep				1469.2196193687355
she was pale and looked fatigued either from tears or want of sleep				1482.634216553649
the prisoner muttered a few words in a foreign tongue				2596.0672608533378
alack cried the cardinal a venetian glass oh my lord said d artagnan quietly shutting the window it is not worth while weeping yet for probably an hour hence there will not be one of your mirrors remaining in the palais royal whether they be venetian or parisian but what do you advise then asked mazarin trembling				19372.183488940398
chapter lx				8530.782951485653
d artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be described				11438.442900443179
this cost me on your account and mine francs				723.9142367608589
say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him now then go said the marquis				50441.01311822583
i have the greatest veneration for the cardinal continued he and the most profound respect for his actions				4606.653534710681
at madame de villefort s proposition he instantly winked his eyes				409.9867021294669
a newly born infant repeated debray this affair becomes serious well said château renaud i was not wrong just now then when i said that houses had souls and faces like men and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters				346659.98247024766
and such magnificent hair				3202.279183607521
you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy sire said villefort the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him yes assuredly replied the minister but he is advancing by gap and sisteron advancing he is advancing said louis xviii				1709.4497450951562
he has deceived her in her love humbled her in her pride thwarted her in her ambition and now he ruins her fortune deprives her of liberty and even threatens her life				537.4048640025187
she was poisoned on my account that s all you know of him asked mazarin				320.7231802961869
in returning with the comte de la fere and monsieur d herblay our crime would be confirmed				304496.61597433215
the district doctor approached with the indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face and just unclosed the lips				748.1302366285017
you must hope for us both maximilian that will make me at least partly happy but why must you leave me so soon i do not know particulars				30105.08746607061
desideras diabolum unhappy man cried the jesuit				23442.62375777508
again the moderate fortune which athos possessed concealed as it was so skillfully seemed to show a regard for appearances and to betray a latent ambition which might be easily aroused				302974.14186749794
in one fashion or another you have a terrible enemy on your hands while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with diamonds which had taken on d artagnan s finger the place of the queen s ring carefully kept in a casket				6355.102553364498
the tall man had scarcely read these lines seen the signature and recognized the seal when he bowed to denote that he had no longer any objection to make and that he was ready to obey				10369.76606480168
the pompous procession therefore wended its way towards père lachaise from the faubourg saint honoré				13761.559980097756
why really i know no one said the major				3707.1777847288986
yes yes said the king caressing it with his hand yes my arthur thou art a fond and faithful creature after this little scene charles threw himself into the saddle and turning to athos aramis and winter said now gentlemen i am at your service but athos was standing with his eyes fixed on a black line which bordered the banks of the tyne and seemed to extend double the length of the camp				1266.0930040584833
and what cares he for that replied gaetano with a laugh or any authorities				278709.617195705
a recollection of athos came into her mind				480.62207434448715
during the last fifteen days she had experienced so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still capable of supporting fatigue her mind required repose				3120.9827209459368
well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain ah then indeed sir said the sweet girl bathed in tears i see that i am condemned to die no valentine for i have foreseen all their plots no your enemy is conquered since we know her and you will live valentine live to be happy yourself and to confer happiness upon a noble heart but to insure this you must rely on me command me sir what am i to do you must blindly take what i give you alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die you must not confide in anyone not even in your father my father is not engaged in this fearful plot is he sir asked valentine clasping her hands				459.1261059806903
during this time mazarin walked up and down the study glancing from time to time at his beautiful venetian mirror starred in every direction				2552.9748655887124
monte cristo leaned against a tree and with that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers by and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was concealed				12027.72812308844
in that case commanded comminges silence that old woman ah				381.5997090491497
but when you held her in your power why did you not drown her strangle her hang her said porthos				47.442537564718776
precisely so replied gaetano				1869666.8693847363
to the champs élysées said the general the count of monte cristo s				1137.7267935743391
but this annoys you let us change the subject				1846.7225551315958
well then said milady i confide in my brother i will dare to at this moment the steps of lord de winter were heard but this time the terrible brother in law of milady did not content himself as on the preceding day with passing before the door and going away again				466.38253120941215
if the studs are not yet gone to paris they will not arrive till after you how so i have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his majesty s ports and without particular permission not one dare lift an anchor d artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king in the prosecution of his intrigues				4786.723088939595
this burden almost as heavy as a world which i had raised and i had thought to bear to the end was too great for my strength and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career				17329.147465871778
but how is it that madame de villefort is not here poor dear woman said debray she is no doubt occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or friends				594.7088831849492
grant me this poor wretch s life				522.7841296681347
how could i help being astonished when without having the least expectation of such a thing i meet you face to face you of whom we have so often spoken together you whom he loves with all his soul you whom he had taught me to love before i had seen you				147.52618420872835
yes said he				6.078184787104417
it was never without a nervous shudder since the dinner at auteuil and the events which followed it that madame danglars heard monte cristo s name announced				2952.378686692252
you are the offended party count doubtless what does that imply that you will fire first i fire first oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that and at what distance twenty paces a smile of terrible import passed over the count s lips				687.3866859668077
gentlemen said the count springing out when you are tired of being actors and wish to become spectators of this scene you know you have places at my windows				1289.3688959761664
why does not he go about his business stupid fellow yourself said d artagnan stooping in his turn on the neck of his horse and answering on his side through the carriage window				712.8208165546789
the jailer brought him his breakfast				1932.172947207337
stay since we have finished dinner i will show it to you and then we will take coffee in the garden				1381.0981360825274
such things continued bertuccio shaking his head are only related under the seal of confession then said the count i refer you to your confessor				40573.45879889274
on reaching the pont neuf the coadjutor found it strictly guarded and a man approached him				63.161727953390596
when his son had left him morrel remained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door then putting forth his arm he pulled the bell				2159.1032937596747
tomorrow then he added turning towards bertuccio				2529.278959045679
give me your word gentlemen that you will not attack me otherwise than one after the other is it to have the pleasure of insulting us that you say that my little viper no but to set my mind at rest as you observed just now it is for something else than that i imagine muttered d artagnan shaking his head doubtfully				416873.23122219054
the queen then began to read and after conversing with her affectionately for a few minutes dismissed her				170.90103922879243
and why if you knew me do you let me die because nothing can save you your wounds are mortal				7426.169821140453
and alone no my lord madame has visitors have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame or do you desire to preserve a strict incognito no indeed replied monte cristo with a smile i do not arrogate to myself the right of so doing and who is with madame m				577.9407305456301
there s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons continued the sailor and during that time the wind had abated and the sea gone down but the water kept rising not much only two inches an hour but still it rose				3845.975964682913
on descending we saw through the lattice work several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view				6978.729625565301
can you imagine said monte cristo some othello or abbé de ganges one stormy dark night descending these stairs step by step carrying a load which he wishes to hide from the sight of man if not from god madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort who was obliged to support himself against the wall				1170.7112452239685
he will do anything i wish				1532.5542205916765
the cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire the three musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters				312929.81374887406
now thinking that her host was a priest that coquette took it into her head that it would be a happy souvenir for her old age among the many happy souvenirs she already possessed if she could win that of having damned an abbé count said the duchess upon my word you frighten me alas continued athos the poor abbé was not a st ambroise and i repeat marie michon was an adorable creature monsieur cried the duchess seizing athos s hands tell me this moment how you know all these details or i will send to the convent of the vieux augustins for a monk to come and exorcise you athos laughed				1555.7156038441153
the catalans chapter				318.257946186795

we bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor				2924.2267620783496
is being in love conspiring				340910.7760156459
the baron d épinay was my friend as you know and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could possibly be arranged do you think said madame de villefort that valentine is in league with him				65.16411733930617
you will excuse my leaving you said the count turning in the direction of his box				1103.4016615573798
you came seeking me to make to me certain proposals but did you make them				115.96973791620968
it was a pledge a remembrance				49771.36430227101
beauchamp solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness				12513.921397592256
diavolo he exclaimed i forgot the recommendation of de comminges who advised me to take a guard and place it at this door in order not to put myself at the mercy of that four headed combination of devils and with a movement of impatience he turned to retrace his steps				1428.5575520924087
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional moments the spectators would suddenly cease their conversation or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant effort of moriani s a well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation				1417.7736811074515
is that monsieur said d artagnan to himself				302.82159161119785
while madame de villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror and villefort with his head hidden in the bedclothes saw nothing around him d avrigny approached the window that he might the better examine the contents of the glass and dipping the tip of his finger in tasted it				92.63980865594363
they had talked of no one but morcerf the whole day				471.6313054930145
to his friends m de villefort was a powerful protector to his enemies he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the one nor the other he was a statue of the law made man				229.905821661095
three hours later the man returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two minutes after another man on foot muffled in a mantle opened the little door of the garden which he closed after him				82.96381751225158
you came you say to see me yes well i reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes and that we shall see each other every day am i then to remain here eternally demanded milady with a certain terror				961.952114200699
but for this precaution which it will be remembered the abbé had made to edmond the misfortune would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated				5776.484287522647
rochefort alone was dissatisfied with the termination of affairs				1601.2823664128964
the steward gave him a gun this was what vampa longed for				976.1352851678552
the man opened his eyes made an effort to raise his head and fell back again				454.64974892569046
who prepared it the chemist who came here with me drink it said the doctor to barrois				3489.6227137811497
but after all said he lowering the point of his spit where is this letter yes where is this letter cried d artagnan				59.27274010450073
we chased him for six hours and when he was near being taken when st simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound the halali crack all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off after a two year older				343804.8356927336
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do and that they would not be so black if they didn t mean mischief that s my opinion too said the captain and i ll take precautions accordingly				109121.98172818389
five minutes elapsed during which franz saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion				8626.280240372764
at his door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for him				75.04880231034369
whom pagans and unbelieving gentiles call duke of buckingham replied milady				120.98016908673313
the days of expectation are long and d artagnan in particular would have wagered that the days were forty four hours				4747.330567641886
i do not know whether you remember that this is the of september it is ten years today since i saved your father s life who wished to die morrel seized the count s hand and kissed it the count allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him				67.61365549691524
i was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it have you shown this letter to anyone asked villefort becoming still more pale				637.2660158833837
i wished to make my adieux to you but time does not permit				11171.926664192812
oh oh replied d artagnan straining both at the same time his quick ear and his intelligent glance it is the murmur of the populace in revolution we must fly said the queen				428.0758599151079
the worthy man restored to perfect health was tasting the fine fruit which madame de longueville had sent to him				75.88940162172983
in a few days you will be away from this place your life madame will then no longer be under my care and added he with a sigh then you can do what you will with it so cried milady as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation you a pious man you who are called a just man you ask but one thing and that is that you may not be inculpated annoyed by my death it is my duty to watch over your life madame and i will watch but do you understand the mission you are fulfilling				450236.6146704972
stay here if you like but i warn you twill be rather too warm presently but we can not swim to the shore the longboat is yonder lashed to the felucca				262342.834356399
two hours afterwards madame danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman s regrets				360648.83906558016
you must resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct and for a man of your intelligence this plan is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that means counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former life andrea visibly changed countenance				1138.5039337804192
night came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal dantès agitation				6641.8229064154475
but you know how the theologians in their collegiate chairs and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel truths let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing in a social way or even philosophically and i will say to you rude as it may seem my brother you sacrifice greatly to pride you may be above others but above you there is god above us all sir was monte cristo s response in a tone and with an emphasis so deep that villefort involuntarily shuddered				3521.36186903137
but now i have forgiven the world for the love of you now that i see you young and with a promising future now that i think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth edmond turned away his head with a sigh				676.2471712488327
in a splendid chamber of the palais royal formerly styled the palais cardinal a man was sitting in deep reverie his head supported on his hands leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with letters and papers				2722.3071062830554
you mean to say then my dear monsieur la ramee that unless monsieur de beaufort can contrive to metamorphose himself into a little bird i will continue answerable for him take care				1742.2315948529028
mazarin is almost king answered athos madame henrietta is almost no longer queen if you would condescend to be clever athos observed aramis i really do think you would be wittier than poor monsieur de voiture athos smiled				610.5927101806053
the next morning d artagnan summoned the host one of those sly normans who say neither yes nor no and fear to commit themselves by giving a direct answer				1138.2270981431934
ah monsieur said planchet on perceiving d artagnan how glad i am to see you why so planchet asked the young man				167.88609951871504
certainly said d artagnan				4.551677727602696
on the nineteenth the impromptu army had attempted a sortie more to assure itself and others of its actual existence than with any more serious intention				384228.08359062776
the most important thing was not to kill him only for i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred times but to kill him without being discovered at least without being arrested				2330.9455367071905
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder case and that you should take something to keep up your strength and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the sofa which was like all the rest covered with papers				2747.6961239025727
captain gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma				266335.92224864656
the cardinal seemed furious				144346.29969956217
noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of perfect indifference at the same time giving a side look at valentine which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room				191.70022196395405
tis you monsieur de chatillon cried the chevalier welcome to you i expected you i hope i have not made you wait too long sir said the duke at all events here i am monsieur de chatillon cried aramis taking from his saddle bags a second pistol i think if your pistols have been discharged you are a dead man thank god sir they are not and the duke pointing his pistol at aramis fired				2279.0641472050634
i should think so but not without difficulty				5137.907471379407
he resolved then to defend the door bravely and as betrayed by the mistress of the inn he could not say that aramis was absent he endeavored to prove to the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his master in his pious conference which had commenced with the morning and would not as bazin said terminate before night				1035.6191562979623
i have replied morrel				69.26005333345637
moreover d artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the demons who wished to search and ill treat her and this important service had established between them one of those sentiments of gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character				2699.3489569026087
to conspire against my honor with madame de chevreuse madame de longueville and the condés oh sire what an idea				2879.349367323844
he has orders to do so				383.8099962819977
these keys were given up to him instantly				3301.294207747356
as regards yourself the need of protection for it is fit you should know monsieur d artagnan that i have received heavy and serious complaints against you				173.27485537887438
without him i should probably at this moment be a dead fish in the nets at saint cloud for it was a question of nothing less than throwing me into the river				5174.55151095955
i think that a man must be so severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no other chastisement who told you that i loved him asked milady sharply				24056.70661284731
the procurator s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine horse				900.9507407963495
will they not sign it no said the paralytic				19964.148004195875
ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment and peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel after having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter who immediately ran down the road leading to the capitol at his fullest speed				2139.2631051372

all i can say is continued the countess taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the box in question that the gentleman whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this earth of ours than anything human				52189.099841433854
what do you mean by a struggle				3807.322093266991
excellency returned bertuccio joining his hands and shaking his head in a manner that would have excited the count s laughter had not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience				3827.4068091996332

a learned italian seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired dantès almost carried him towards the window in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating				40199.628961004935

they think of me in their pleasures as i thought of them in my troubles				199032.11370010843
the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could scarcely distinguish				59031.33191197878
then his head was seen passing at the back of the boxes and the count knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him				85.99268690267334
thank god we can keep a secret the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker				14052.829902732952
notwithstanding the judges were so few the trial was to continue the king then was condemned in advance				5066.149699691327

i was brought up in the country and my father in his leisure time was something of a poacher and what did he do the rest of his time monsieur he carried on a trade which i have always thought satisfactory which as it was a time of war between the catholics and the huguenots and as he saw the catholics exterminate the huguenots and the huguenots exterminate the catholics all in the name of religion he adopted a mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes catholic sometimes a huguenot				276305.27134002984

when they reached a certain spot these men appeared to be annihilated one after the other as if the earth had opened under their feet				971.6289188883567
d artagnan continued athos you who but lately were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to monseigneur here it is avail yourself of it these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which distinguished athos in the hour of danger and with that excessive politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic than kings by birth				5004.558886113893
albert took the letter opened and read it then looked round for bertuccio but he was gone				2526.45113789334
this enemy was milady				751.7799609364264

three or four times he started up imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of stabbing him				85.40371514021555
a very respectable lady said aramis				23.318575365341868
meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing in the room which had been so carefully locked				309230.9834172784
tis true madame answered he that my father was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king s death he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of terror and had well nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in proof of which i may remark that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government and that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin the count noirtier became a senator dear mother interposed renée you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside suffer me also madame replied villefort to add my earnest request to mademoiselle de saint méran s that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past				3417.4993915683813
in the large room of the hotel a small table was placed for him and a large one for the officers				3938.5851975599344
the iron made no impression but met with a smooth surface dantès touched it and found that it was a beam				282098.24651762214
why so i play with monsieur du vallon every night				1157.3407722087054
bertuccio the steward appeared at the door				342.463291716162
danglars has only been a secondary agent in this sad affair and it is of m de monte cristo that you must demand an explanation albert turned				4652.947800010597
see gentlemen said m de beaufort this wonderful animal not finding here what i ask for seeks it out of doors you shall however have his answer				1075.8234385147448
and since villefort the friend of danglars had acted in this way no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of andrea s intrigues				4666.862052753474
if i had listened to you the knife would have been pointed and of steel				11566.302277690234
after casting a rapid glance around him in order to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small gate and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier				18627.879346330432
try porthos to please them more than you are wont to do when they are under our windows				1301.1581316955312
shoulder muskets				5080.771422106122
he described the death of the other soldier and the perils they had encountered				56390.546085719376

ah i see you are smiling if you are already aware of the conversation that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security come what did she say she told me that she loved no one said valentine that she disliked the idea of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered life and that she almost wished her father might lose his fortune that she might become an artist like her friend mademoiselle louise d armilly ah you see well what does that prove asked valentine				698.2906937732886
then said albert you became the property of this man no replied haydée he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople				244226.96869668004
at the bois de boulogne ennui and hunger attacked me at once two enemies who rarely accompany each other and who are yet leagued against me a sort of carlo republican alliance				4635.461896194206
this way this way my dear albert said he holding out his hand to the young man				227.92792594914934
then once free from the day and hour and moment when he was so he could have but one only thought which was to gain monte cristo by some means and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed spot the appointed spot be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second opening				17126.342112908056
at a quarter to six o clock monsieur de gondy having finished his business returned to the archiepiscopal palace				1482.8597587595311
i am not only the most miserable of queens but the most unhappy of mothers the most wretched of wives				221674.5696705411
he was quite alone on one side was the vast wilderness of the saint lazare on the other paris enshrouded in darkness				1701.4622657585187
in exchange for all this he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution and her protection as it was known protected badly as witness chalais and mme				199.01339902382796
villefort leaped out of the carriage and saw that his servants were surprised at his early return he could read no other expression on their features				15521.071668567687
monte cristo left alone took three or four steps onwards and murmured here beneath this plane tree must have been where the infant s grave was dug				338302.95261095726
what is the meaning of that noise oh my god cried morrel turning pale what is it a loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily and half stifled sobs				4114.000468457622
for this purpose i applied all the strength i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in which i lay to the adjoining room				186.403888643452
he attacked this wall cemented by the hand of time with his pickaxe				253334.19590865955
faria smiled				510.38342559954884
half an hour an hour an hour and a half elapsed and during this period of anguish edmond leaned over his friend his hand applied to his heart and felt the body gradually grow cold and the heart s pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at length it stopped the last movement of the heart ceased the face became livid the eyes remained open but the eyeballs were glazed				209092.92672675403
at the barriere des sergents the procession was obliged to stop				3244.324488256422
that emetic villefort see if it is coming villefort sprang into the passage exclaiming the emetic				296986.0448629563
in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the monte cristo arms which were a mountain or on a sea azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his name that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lord s passion more precious than gold and to the degrading cross which his blood had rendered holy or it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the night of this mysterious personage s past life				568.8769586256142
to save a man to spare a father s feelings or a mother s sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity at these words uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness madame de morcerf replied it is very fortunate for my son monsieur that he found such a friend and i thank god that things are thus and mercédès raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent an expression of gratitude that the count fancied he saw tears in them				119.41697782234154
have i by any means displeased you				106.67124671260432
i am rich enough to know whatever i desire to know and i can promise you i am not wanting in curiosity				2036.7546626435703
athos and aramis kept themselves to their role				158891.96820013985
a gentleman in his opinion and according to d artagnan s portrait of him the stranger must be a gentleman would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter				726.281956102257
yes go go said she to her brother the effects are drawing near on the contrary but you weak fool will not see them until it is too late to shun them silence was re established				297027.68229207385
heaven is as inflexible as man and the signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o clock				1038.5011518271997
porthos waved his hand to mousqueton to pick up the bottles				6239.308093439288
but enough of this here is my card take it to your master madame will await my return yes go the concierge closed the door leaving madame danglars in the street				1571.8360233105545

so then they have paid my ransom no your excellency well then how am i free a person to whom i can refuse nothing has come to demand you come hither yes hither really				3070.027608372732
it was the abode of the little abbé scarron				3500.442021113192
all right said caderousse				125.3736938303576
let him come yes echoed porthos glancing affectionately at his sword still hanging on the wall we can wait for him let him come moreover he is but a child said aramis				128.29434597202717
neither was he one of those who think that the necessary silence of the night brings counsel with it				96.0096621179823
you have told me how you talk to him and how he answers you i shall very soon learn that language by signs valentine and i promise you solemnly that instead of despair it is happiness that awaits us oh see maximilian see the power you have over me you almost make me believe you and yet what you tell me is madness for my father will curse me he is inflexible he will never pardon me				101.81350111771853
the footsteps they were double paused at the door and dantès guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this idea was soon converted into certainty when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand bier				45437.17164820215
i wish to inform you my lord replied groslow with an irish accent feigned of course that if you are looking for captain rogers you will not find him				71.51587088206954
but where you go i go they then set off for rueil				5742.813340755117
yes the priest oh i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise but he was beforehand with me he had quit the curacy the night before was it ever known who this miserable fellow was he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady				2931.4921261190284
i will tell you mr president				1233.1212654739181

what next de wardes can not boast of anything how is that				767.9077473196962
and he held out to the concierge the notary s order				3277.0468731396645
she comes from martinique so i call her the beautiful indian raoul looked surprised and his eyes met those of the young lady who smiled				672.9821121368258
you must make some reformation in that quarter you have opened my eyes said the italian gravely i will show the gentlemen the door monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter and who only needs one thing more to make him happy yes indeed but one said the major with a sigh				709.5270067326585
this gentleman was a young man scarcely sixteen years of age now white with anger				1562.1940430484328
for himself he had no doubt she was a victim of the cardinal s vengeance and as was well known the vengeance of his eminence was terrible				5953.521240761823
the bed had iron clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screw driver to take them off				1223.5332075914976
but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this since dantès shuddered this man had been four years longer than himself in prison				1459.992671397276
that name was indeed one to inspire imagination and produce thought				2701.3434885859897
what an awakening for the parisians said the queen radiant				39435.220885640425
villefort s conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage				12520.80932906541
m danglars no longer had a daughter				1644.897999320933

but monte cristo looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a smile that maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes				380.49117871204794
morrel said the count to him at length do you repent having followed me no count but to leave paris if i thought happiness might await you in paris morrel i would have left you there valentine reposes within the walls of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second time maximilian said the count the friends that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the earth but are buried deep in our hearts and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them				109.35668587593584

england is torn in twain by a spirit of disturbance which i greatly fear blood alone can exorcise but lord montrose replied the queen i have heard of his great and rapid successes of battles gained				51295.234213713265
the thunder growled in the air like the passion and anger in her thoughts				954.0620780782998
perhaps mazarin wishes to make a speculation in beer as we did in straw said porthos				48.10992160468098

athos on quitting aramis went to madame de chevreuse				2631.423886161116
his fear was lest the governor touched with pity might order him to be removed to better quarters and thus separate him from his young companion				1237.6967138222292
the number thirteen was always fatal to me it was on the thirteenth of july that ventrebleu cried d artagnan rising from the table the story of the present day making him forget that of the preceding one				928.6612650004228
then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly and that the appointment was for eleven o clock				1040.898682655545
nay dear mother say the accused person				1231.865353658925

that same evening upon reaching his abode in the champs élysées the count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one long acquainted with each nook or corner				3575.4851613734736
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young girl as if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old lady on her death bed requested that the marriage might take place as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me hark said morrel				704.5034369117267
would it not be expecting too much to hope to succeed at your first attempt				47576.576330062184
oh yes				1076.1112658543825
the same evening some friends of mine visited me m				441.33813384996927

the valet threw into the carriage his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the door he took his seat by the side of the coachman				3645.511572279325

with one word you have crushed it and i die but the duel will not take place edmond since you forgive it will take place said monte cristo in a most solemn tone but instead of your son s blood to stain the ground mine will flow mercédès shrieked and sprang towards monte cristo but suddenly stopping edmond said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again i trust to him from my heart				365.2333765868868

go go i implore you and return hereafter				45367.28717268438
neither you nor myself but fernand you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the room indeed i fancied i had destroyed it oh no replied caderousse that i can answer for you did not				634.4514050343561
did you come here to fetch me				82.51696606816367

the monks had no longer an instant of repose				2974.1854636353664
about this time a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of				2083.294866553691
oh selfish man				167.8846585469483
porthos had found nothing and with him fatigue had prevailed over hunger				2167.1620974148004
when one is eating ideas flow easily				5565.164835126169
certes these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged thought the terrified d artagnan and i no doubt with them for from the moment i have either listened to or heard them i shall be held as an accomplice				13657.25364471118
are you not going to keep your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage what a confounded long time this first act lasts				350056.91019790084

the two young men galloped off in the direction mentioned and in ten minutes reached the inn				1872.2405141019565
what would my good father say who so strongly pointed out to me the respect due to the cardinal if he knew i was in the society of such pagans we have no need therefore to say that d artagnan dared not join in the conversation only he looked with all his eyes and listened with all his ears stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing and despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions he felt himself carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to blame the unheard of things which were taking place				828.0371634768691
why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that				734.8045949299831
his relations with the former court of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new one and he knew so many things that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes consulted				282940.48865265754

at the end of twelve days after having made a splendid dinner he reckoned his accounts and found that he had only francs left				1479.2559024913385

sire we have all been blind and the minister of police has shared the general blindness that is all but said villefort and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away				500.5835591318345
blaisois seeing bazin in clerical guise was a little discomposed at his denials and wanted to pass at all risks believing too that the man with whom he had to do was endowed with the virtues of his cloth namely patience and christian charity				122171.90101558408
good day said he				6.424633641537595
stop yes doubtless replied d artagnan who had never been able to cram the first rudiments of that language into his head and who had by his ignorance driven his master to despair yes doubtless there is one there certainly is one said m de tréville who had a tincture of literature and monsieur de benserade was quoting it to me the other day				446.6776342217184

but you my dear d artagnan what can you expect my dear porthos a man is not privileged in all ways said d artagnan				44.45362310683594
now would anybody think that this room contained a happy merry party who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away ah sighed caderousse a man can not always feel happy because he is about to be married the truth is replied dantès that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy friend you are right joy takes a strange effect at times it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow danglars looked towards fernand whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression				11309.041426105372
this fortnight expired he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three months three months passed away then six more				1306.376546208479

what said he is it you my dear franz whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed no not i replied franz but our neighbor the count of monte cristo oh my dear count said albert gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands you are really most kind and i hope you will consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first place for the carriage and in the next for this visit and he put out his hand to the count who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it				88.74036973276672
this path was formed in the shape of the figure of thus in its windings making a walk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty				6675.695267006245
for a moment d artagnan thought that parry s brother had disappeared but he was mistaken				1671.075461009548
the carriage however passed on				600.2072252523095

that i am exceedingly disquieted sire really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine no sire for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and seven years of scarcity and with a king as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not a thing to be feared then of what other scourge are you afraid my dear blacas sire i have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the south well my dear duke replied louis xviii i think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the contrary it is very fine weather in that direction man of ability as he was louis xviii				1899.4755401494526

franz had as yet found nothing to say he had come to no determination and as nothing in the count s manner manifested the wish that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more proof besides although sure it was he who had been in the box the previous evening he could not be equally positive that this was the man he had seen at the colosseum				62195.16432526686
directly afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard but no one paid any attention to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and villefort was still absorbed in grief				3469.4472440014843
d artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to mme				178.3272691495529
what s the matter asked aramis				28.778619428447318
in all probability therefore the transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself and the man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the sailor but who no doubt was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome as he had already done at porto vecchio and tunis				13011.054369212849
besides we feel always a sort of mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they suppose				13954.058764626256

it is not god s will that they should be accomplished				15249.140844498124

his assistant broke his leg last night beneath your majesty s window the cry we heard was his and there is no executioner nearer at hand than bristol but the comte de la fere asked the king				532.5473500780904
you lose ground you are turning				472455.3970381038
the hinges of the door creaked and a man appeared in the dress of a cavalier wrapped in a brown cloak with a lantern in one hand and a large beaver hat pulled down over his eyes				406.7808365231638
besides make yourselves easy we shall not all arrive at london why so because in all probability some one of us will be left on the road is this then a campaign upon which we are now entering one of a most dangerous kind i give you notice ah				354.29336822515864
if i ever find him again and i will find him i swear were it in hell he was waiting for a woman continued tréville				1128.2524572947268
when he came within hearing he exclaimed i am pursued can you conceal me they knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit but there is an innate sympathy between the roman brigand and the roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former				33346.91473193789
and not without a deal of trouble too has the executioner left london asked athos				56.743998646947624

you would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that ah depreciate other persons dinners you ministers give such splendid ones yes but we do not invite people of fashion				4637.491451285363
as she had a loose muslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure i saw she would ere long become a mother				1625.5878489749216
a lamp burned in the chamber occupied by the priest				3099.0201118651107
all this i did scrupulously				1345599.8596086705
porthos effaced himself against the wall but he could not render himself invisible and the man in the cloak said to him giving him his lantern light the lamp which hangs from the ceiling then addressing d artagnan you know the watchword he said				494.36530458350575
what do you want sir said the king				262.83952991444824
dantès recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty				1673.3862731402915
but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of morrel son				792.5187763036795
never fear quarrels but seek adventures				30826.151954473597
in fact at half past eight in the evening the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three other drawing rooms on the same floor were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the event but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there is anything fresh to be seen				2810.09553142276
anne of austria alone was permitted to enter by that door				343.766934911323
he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny				4711.060422464253
here is night coming on by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat and nobody can guess where we are				839.5894457288426
although apparently not noticing albert he did not however lose sight of him and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends				603.5259965445953
it was on that occasion that my ancestor enguerrand de la fere was made a knight of the order of st michael besides which the king fifteen years afterward gave him also this ewer and a sword which you may have seen formerly in my house also a lovely specimen of workmanship				39509.52970619534
but d artagnan still keeping on the defensive drew near to kitty s door				342.5503412634559
i have told you that without being able to regain the complete exercise of my faculties i retained the sense of my danger				3334.9887294122163
let us see what this letter contains we here present the letter verbatim to his eminence monseigneur le cardinal mazarini i have wished monseigneur to learn your intentions relating to the existing state of affairs in england				928.8605554705472
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against circumstances not men				893.3505843223877
this means sire replied the cardinal that i was desirous of presenting her majesty with these two studs and that not daring to offer them myself i adopted this means of inducing her to accept them and i am the more grateful to your eminence replied anne of austria with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his majesty then saluting the king and the cardinal the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed and where she was to take off her costume				3660.65934680347
do not fancy that i do you a favor i use either hand easily				5438.908183607843
no one can say that m noirtier did not love his child and yet he sleeps yes you are right replied villefort surprised he sleeps indeed				1367.9119412892094
why has he not painted a spot upon his heart it would have been more simple meanwhile albert had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young men				899.4788227860914
then with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture he approached anne of austria from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage				2208.162246551248
do you find the means i will execute it provided it is not to kill the man for mercédès has declared she will kill herself if dantès is killed caderousse who had let his head drop on the table now raised it and looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes he said kill dantès				439.63470919283577
prove it danglars				413.1260240371853
that would be too terrible calm yourself sir replied de guiche				1894.9350638912047
we shall not interfere with each other your object is a title mine money				936.8539399139518
enough enough replied caderousse say no more about it i will take all the consequences upon myself and he began his story				1544.9284944347555
no other of the bandits would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what carlini had done				1654.398692474964
the departure for belgium a few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of m danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests				2468.745148213021
what do you ask of me said he your son s life				541.1414299489306

at the very moment when i was about to pay you i had placed my purse on the table yes monsieur that purse contained sixty pistoles where is it deposited with the justice they said it was bad money very well get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which it once lays hold of				2146.05331134747

it is a bad sign a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the hands of a man but your excellency replied bertuccio hesitatingly did not the abbé busoni who heard my confession in the prison at nîmes tell you that i had a heavy burden upon my conscience yes but as he said you would make an excellent steward i concluded you had stolen that was all oh your excellency returned bertuccio in deep contempt				4196.014121942141
athos has been arrested yesterday at saint germain as he came out from the presence of the queen the arms of d artagnan fell powerless by his side				1491.0995747050144
milady raised her head saw close to the panes the pale face of athos and screamed				17147.88247911175
permesso inquired he				10.496726954120627
when this was done eugénie opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak				1332.4525358551102
oh of the most unfortunate kind monsieur				1422.0025661212235
he has six millions worth he must sell them at whatever price why because don carlos has fled from bourges and has returned to spain how do you know debray shrugged his shoulders				1255.1049576659523
besides said she the sum you required me to borrow was rather large madame coquenard i gave you the preference				581285.2635205034
athos and aramis started with delight to find that the king was lying with his clothes on				647.5500122992344
bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening				14657.768600354239
i must positively find out who and what he is said franz rising from his seat				2028.9021453137693
no doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that fountain and had taken advantage of my confidence in it the better to assure my ruin so coolly resolved upon so cruelly pursued				30303.091394437735
some of these boats were dark and mysterious others noisy and lighted up with torches				23900.97604540656
well at twenty nine i saw valentine for two years i have loved her for two years i have seen written in her heart as in a book all the virtues of a daughter and wife				1168.8810963108608
d artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand and turned up the number three his paleness terrified athos who however consented himself with saying that s a sad throw comrade you will have the horses fully equipped monsieur the englishman quite triumphant did not even give himself the trouble to shake the dice				3586.7348625669433
so much the better young man				198.80018490033302
athos saw the movement he made a step toward the muskets upon which the other three friends had fixed their eyes like men ill disposed to allow themselves to be taken				1738.7740808348485
suppose i were a soldier like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go father for you are dishonored by delay and death is preferable to shame yes yes said the young man yes and once again embracing his father with convulsive pressure he said be it so my father and he rushed out of the study				3950.0090924952074
in a moment or two the conversation ceased and the three guardsmen and the musketeer after having cordially shaken hands separated the guardsmen going one way and aramis another				740.2782286224875
he questioned me concerning captain leclere s death and as the latter had told me gave me a letter to carry on to a person in paris				428.095660253243
porthos was resplendent with joy and pride				2905.0668841073075
and you are happy he said to his friend				655.3431032787257
athos did the same				1768.0752909993955
chapter xii				8958.721489383202
come come said milady lifting hers to her mouth do as i do but at the moment the glass touched her lips her hand remained suspended she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop				1401.5922477239355
the chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a single word of it				97.77549922553139

felton began to descend the ladder slowly step by step				2349.252013639645
d artagnan was a physiognomist				369085.5577881117
in fact the rochellais had made a sortie during the night and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before				1173.4833857148533
he then motioned to his wife to take leave				3504.045880909422
an hour of terror elapsed for every spot they passed showed that they were on the road back				1346.546470557415
but how asked mazarin				155.8128347892178
god pardon me cried buckingham i really think he threatens me no my lord i still plead				389612.0131602955
when he saw luigi he put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him				88.96012776905883
d artagnan inquired for the confidential valet of the duke who having accompanied him in all his voyages spoke french perfectly well he told him that he came from paris on an affair of life and death and that he must speak with his master instantly				3321.0967255261367
it was a gloomy dusty looking apartment such as journalists offices have always been from time immemorial				425765.16568486724
gentlemen said groslow i beg you will take your places				85045.90311835097
now although la ramee appreciated as of a certain value the honor of being shut up with a prisoner of so great importance still the pleasure of living in intimacy with the grandson of henry iv				1251.7179459590511
tell me where there				782.7222445600885
oh madame said the count when valentine had left the room was it on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away by no means replied the young lady quickly but this is the hour when we usually give m noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence				4875.159366322387
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the head then the shoulders and lastly the body of a man who sprang lightly into his cell				2802.8971330734635
be so good as to collect and throw us back our balls said the duke				599.3926777138907
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when monte cristo went one evening to pay m danglars a visit				1521.7528224331197
i am come to fetch you monsieur d artagnan from whom his eminence sent me tell my lord that i m going to sleep and i advise him as a friend to do the same his eminence is not gone to bed and will not go to bed and wants you instantly the devil take mazarin who does not know when to sleep at the proper time				317.2459720708547
the little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night				1196.6374012010729
by degrees the light of the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel				914.4302565208153
at length i saw the lamp rise softly and disappear in the depths of the ceiling my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity but i made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity				1165.1988181591466
in the meanwhile i am a musketeer in that quality i say what i please and at this moment it pleases me to say that you weary me aramis porthos gentlemen				1786.485637775203
athos would have died rather than appeal for help but he could look and with that look ask assistance				3273.891905042733
the carnival was over				1826.6041238667456
god s blood cried the officer have they killed him				69.56097544514006
they had not mistaken the gravity of this event for the moment after morrel had entered his private office with cocles julie saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his features betraying the utmost consternation				95784.32753028127
i am uneasy about blaisois said athos he can he says only swim in rivers when people can swim at all they can swim anywhere				247383.6006173902
ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its mother				1627.9048438877053
we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted with each other				951.3087143891821
it is true that the three others had endeavored to knock the young man down with chairs stools and crockery but two or three scratches made by the gascon s blade terrified them				135.03426288427303
on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre the cardinal found standing before the house he occupied d artagnan without his sword and the three musketeers armed				28901.04834029664
to meet d artagnan with a false excuse				2075.8765372487223
i only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king ah you knew that said mordaunt				958.457719974966
formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviolable				432161.59967735264
he labored and toiled until he had amassed francs six years sufficed to achieve this object				6134.234582010381
he had retired at one o clock under the pretense of being indisposed				176344.11534343776
we are going according to all probability to la rochelle and once gone she will follow you to the end of the world athos if she recognizes you				186.27700506618754
well i would reform her it would be rendering a service to her future son in law how would you set about it ah that would be easy enough i would give her a lesson a lesson yes				1143.1899277594364
grimaud said athos still on the breach another musket grimaud immediately obeyed				1619.8943576164343
have you not perceived it it may be but you know the more hearts are worth the capture the more difficult they are to be won oh difficulties do not affright me said d artagnan				130.6267496434265
you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word and then it will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied				340756.70498002716
now said athos that we can not even recognize one another and have therefore no fear of others recognizing us let us go and see the king s entrance they had not been long in the crowd before loud cries announced the king s arrival				21271.981532411603
six days ago i landed at portsmouth well said felton				603.8132729480735
the king took it with a trembling hand looked for the address which was wanting became very pale opened it slowly then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the king of spain he read it rapidly				250867.0063862433
he is going to fall cried morrel				110.71092567858304
i knew the horse he rode it belonged to the butcher who lets it out now and then to m bazin				2857.1954910976533
but he is mistaken i shall not leave so near the queen that source of discord with which the deceased cardinal so often caused the anger of the king to rage above the boiling point anne blushed and buried her face in her hands				486.6017941226651
a sort of book written upon strips of cloth go and fetch it my good fellow and if it be what i hope you will do well i will run for it sir and the guide went out				385.241823522417
you m de villefort send for the priest i will be the avenger what do you mean sir asked villefort trembling at the new idea inspired by the delirium of morrel				797.138440799382
as he finished the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which fortunately for him had been left out of the cellar				2189.564070462206
he had asked for crawfish for his breakfast on the following morning he intended to pass the day in making a small gallows and hang one of the finest of these fish in the middle of his room the red color evidently conveying an allusion to the cardinal so that he might have the pleasure of hanging mazarin in effigy without being accused of having hung anything more significant than a crawfish				355937.9550653051
a large cloak was spread at the stern the officer requested her to sit down upon this cloak and placed himself beside her				251.15328306284013
now you understand my dear monsieur cavalcanti that it is useless for you to tell people in france that you have been separated from your son for fifteen years				1011.7670351346482
raoul was aroused from his sombre reflections by his host who rushed into the apartment crying out the spaniards				22308.476902653092
my mother has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the count of monte cristo had laid his hands on a turnout which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of connoisseurs				328993.8969824449
adieu valentine adieu said morrel bowing				9724.498163722497
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual				278649.2875339163
they are the spoils of victory i the heir of an enemy said athos for whom then do you take me it is the custom in war said d artagnan why should it not be the custom in a duel even on the field of battle i have never done that porthos shrugged his shoulders aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed athos				180.66246894959536
if you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question i believe there is nothing to say against him and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty but tell me dantès if you had command of the pharaon should you be glad to see danglars remain captain or mate m morrel i shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence that s right that s right dantès				513.6322437089884
one moment my lord whispered athos and he said something in a low voice				656.145135490288
i am the most wretched of men				887.9260428431713
yes where at the louvre are you sure of it perfectly sure who told you of it madame de lannoy who is devoted to your eminence as you know why did she not let me know sooner whether by chance or mistrust the queen made madame de surgis sleep in her chamber and detained her all day well we are beaten				8695.827590411896
no i must leave you at ten o clock your engagement was for breakfast then said the count				149.79573140425438
the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of franz s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his features for the countess after gazing with a puzzled look at his face burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened				2380.847536543732
there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties the excise was in truth the everlasting enemy of the patron of la jeune amélie				328737.34708507836
and with her left hand seizing the thick mass which her long fingers could scarcely grasp she took in her right hand a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid hair which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned back to keep it from her coat				1671.6317415285166
well yes you are right that name has still its charms and this is the first time for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly				7177.688550227951
but tell me count will your people take care of my horse do not alarm yourself my dear maximilian they understand i mean because he wants petting				561692.8242844433

they were ambitious and cæsar borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments				371990.6195321702
no no i am here said the monk quickly coming back to him				84.34773595300821
not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly everyone waited anxiously				5151.984506170637
he sought to tread water in order to rest himself but the sea was too violent and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation				377155.2328457654
a fine name said morrel				70.58356405835488
yes my captain as they went the citizens awakened left their doors and the street dogs followed the cavaliers barking				232653.5059364257
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct				54716.08824822359
think well of your reply for should your eminence be mistaken there might ensue most grave results for all of us along the wall sir said mazarin there will be no danger of losing yourselves the three friends hastened on but in a short time were obliged to slacken the pace				2139.8997298523695
the youth s dark hair was neatly parted and hung in curls forming a sort of dark frame around his face such was the fashion of the day				459.4802496964391
this event might have three causes the first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the rochellais who might not be sorry to kill one of his majesty s guards because it would be an enemy the less and this enemy might have a well furnished purse in his pocket				1290.8077598669129
but the king soon again became dull and indisposed his brow was not one of those that long remain clear				5312.642411537262
two men whom you will find at the door on going out will serve you as escort				2357.1998798584486
oh if i had my three friends here cried he i should have at least some hopes of finding her but who knows what has become of them it was past midnight the next thing was to find planchet				1086.5156887629673
villefort drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the house				405.81853641363125
all these old soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the people here do not like soldiers of such disorderly conduct monsieur i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor brother had a wife and were anything to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my brother s pay alone kept her				211.8820998808089

the fellows looked at the body of their companion swimming in blood and then recovering voice and legs together ran screaming off				1201.366735197401
this noirtier was his father had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dantès or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words				726.8262258659933

this is all very easy for you to say replied d artagnan for you athos who live like a dumb man with grimaud who forbid him to speak and consequently never exchange ill words with him for you porthos who carry matters in such a magnificent style and are a god to your valet mousqueton and for you aramis who always abstracted by your theological studies inspire your servant bazin a mild religious man with a profound respect but for me who am without any settled means and without resources for me who am neither a musketeer nor even a guardsman what am i to do to inspire either the affection the terror or the respect in planchet this is serious answered the three friends it is a family affair				1741.3935588611644

nineteen years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness				1696.5009868022032
should not a magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession a steel probe to search hearts a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy sir said villefort upon my word you overcome me				109.53219130811773
now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise man who said when in doubt keep out meaning to say rejoined monte cristo that however thomson french may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the baron danglars is not disposed to follow their example not at all plainly enough messrs thomson french set no bounds to their engagements while those of m danglars have their limits he is a wise man according to his own showing monsieur replied the banker drawing himself up with a haughty air the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned it seems then reserved for me said monte cristo coldly to be the first to do so by what right sir by right of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive once more danglars bit his lips				640.0650335235213

he remained silent his eyes fixed upon the light the boat went on but the prisoner thought only of mercédès				1573.6081131991734
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls diamonds and other gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth				5393.808969521099
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into valentine s room				192.08333707146926
impossible doctor it is too late my throat is closing up				1247.7610256912303
you talk of sacrilege				56629.341545889336
that s another matter				466.84755489833276
the prince dismounted ordered one of his aids and raoul to follow his example and directed the others to await his orders keeping themselves meanwhile on the alert				42872.221828931615
meanwhile athos in his concealment waited in vain the signal to recommence his work				1269.3028201886727
be easy monsieur said planchet you do not know me yet				4667.365005165376
a propos said m de tréville calling him back				1073.3736145009993
it is an old man s caprice and is there no means of making him revoke his decision yes said madame de villefort and it is still entirely in the power of my husband to cause the will which is now in prejudice of valentine to be altered in her favor the count who perceived that m and madame de villefort were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no attention to the conversation and feigned to be busily engaged in watching edward who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird s water glass				935.2181161064553
the cardinal there awaited louis xiii				985.8518109071489

there is but one service i can render you and for that i place myself entirely at your orders that is to present or make my friends present you everywhere besides you have no need of anyone to introduce you with your name and your fortune and your talent monte cristo bowed with a somewhat ironical smile you can present yourself everywhere and be well received				4507.5600455630965
in an instant d artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be to go home and write milady a long letter in which he would confess to her that he and de wardes were up to the present moment absolutely the same and that consequently he could not undertake without committing suicide to kill the comte de wardes				2742.9991325127103
albert completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated monte cristo was sleeping in an armchair near the window while the count was designing with his architect the plan of a conservatory in his house when the sound of a horse at full speed on the high road made albert look up				1224.9669414550328
how do you do madame dantès mercédès courtesied gravely and said that is not my name and in my country it bodes ill fortune they say to call a young girl by the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband				1461.6024272923714

they both came immediately m morrel bringing a doctor and the doctor said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet				427287.6940775008
morcerf had expected he should be the guide on the contrary it was he who under the count s guidance followed a course of archæology mineralogy and natural history				10640.520680930482
and thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him my god				481.2054581293902
sire stammered the baron				2924.9575084767566
he started and the prisoner saw that start for though her eyes were cast down nothing escaped her				194.35700745360415
mazarin was a cheat at the card table				696.0587015656943
d artagnan on the contrary quite full of his plans of conciliation and courtesy approached the young men with a profound bow accompanied by a most gracious smile				613.1289586823049
this evening your destiny begins to change amen exclaimed d artagnan stopping the carriage				1370.1275422515691
the latter obeyed without reply and entered the chamber where he appeared to be expected				2140.0507519697567
he had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at two o clock fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on one side in the corso and on the other in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten minutes walk from the hôtel de londres				9723.274072225193
however i shall have no occasion to work for the little sum of money buried by you and which i found in the place you mentioned will be sufficient to maintain me				110.0954097344397
they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman				29483.327120473044
i had known the famous vampa for more than ten years				946.8835486586662
and now said morrel leave me alone and endeavor to keep your mother and sister away will you not see my sister once more asked maximilian				2837.1459936035185
misfortune refreshes the memory				5669.659003604719
he saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment				51575.42169345462
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services that upon edmond s release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the pharaon than for dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts thanks danglars that will smooth over all difficulties				16887.471865713997
nevertheless he never borrowed a sou of his companions although his purse was ever at their service and when he had played upon honor he always awakened his creditor by six o clock the next morning to pay the debt of the preceding evening				538.2966003036122

i might have handed him over to roman justice which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but i did nothing of the sort i suffered him and his band to depart with the condition that they should sin no more said beauchamp laughing				2289.2817139487347
he can not possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid servant but a mere slave a dog who should he fail in his duty towards me i should not discharge from my service but kill baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment				649.5375590522818

their horses were fed but not unsaddled the grooms supped for it was already late and their two masters impatient to return appointed a place of meeting with them on the jetty and desired them on no account to exchange a word with any one				918.201423728995

raoul i seem to read your future destiny as through a cloud				172101.63668719892
yes raoul replied the count				175.30858699004946
he then began to ascend the path				12870.046690856852
before him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition				74982.06241902834
the messenger was unmoved				12145.205827699556

villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid hand across his forehead entered his study				3585.729353921965
it was necessary to compel him to open it as the sergeant had been compelled to speak and this took another ten minutes				1310.6518353908032
the dead once buried in their graves rise no more and i tell you sir that you are mistaken				1529.006747722046
she thanked them both with a smile				594.1434115002462

but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass she but who is she oh i remember said mme				85.19457056089922
the man who lives to see shall see and slipping through the aperture he alighted in the court				1239.7528356249352
morrel only then recollected the letter he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any reason he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that something terrible was brooding				513032.83652259794
and this bed with red hangings a bed visited by the goddess lucina				345663.33432572865

the circumstance irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary				2097.2838868562008
he held out his hand				278.93680757206545
are you satisfied well said felton till tonight and he darted out of the room shut the door and waited in the corridor the soldier s half pike in his hand and as if he had mounted guard in his place				927.1931492744119

d artagnan stood for an instant mute pensive and motionless then as he went in he saw the fair madeleine his hostess standing on the threshold				2177.5029571467444
send away that fellow raoul said the gascon for if he s a coward he will disgrace thee some day monsieur says i am coward cried olivain because he wanted the other day to fight a cornet in grammont s regiment and i refused to accompany him monsieur olivain a lackey ought never to disobey said d artagnan sternly then taking him aside he whispered to him thou hast done right thy master was in the wrong here s a crown for thee but should he ever be insulted and thou dost not let thyself be cut in quarters for him i will cut out thy tongue				3134.7042413111394
the king s request had undoubtedly been acceded to by an affirmative sign for in firm sonorous accents which vibrated in the depths of athos s heart the king began his speech explaining his conduct and counseling the welfare of the kingdom				9216.949808805532
has the law ears to be melted by your sweet voice				575.370307958946

live the cardinal resounded on every side and the drums were beaten in all directions				5519.5292740346185
i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who fears to enter my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and sensations				27855.16360429768
as soon as you feel able to swim we will go i shall never swim again replied faria				10670.315054282877
raoul remained silent for he was not prepared for the dignity of the bel esprit				349108.7548270091
now who was that someone				514470.8445138786
there were three gates to open before reaching the inclosure each by a different key				7478.927118911421
the baroness ascended the steps she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the valet de chambre who never lost sight of her for an instant she was introduced to the magistrate s study				3562.1299210772113
m noirtier yes think you it was the poor servant s life was coveted				331016.26447123924
but here it is you have sentiments the devil knows what such as every one can t entertain				56343.2948419504
this is quite another man and does not resemble him at all				670.4933101592025
ali is my slave and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty to me nay interposed madame de villefort on whom the authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own his life madame belongs not to him it is mine in return for my having myself saved him from death madame de villefort made no further reply her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the person who from the first instant she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her				214.99381998253634
well he is a man of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another				757.9328022877573
he could not endure it and sent parry to ask the sentinel to beg the workmen to strike more gently and not disturb the last slumber of one who had been their king				568.5453023160792
here are five hundred pistoles he said and if the action goes off well you may reckon upon a similar sum to morrow i will give a faithful account of the sum to your lordship said planchet putting the bag under his arm				1100.2991576044772
d artagnan had taken the precaution to set apart four trusses for his own use				8834.906798464146
what are you waiting for said caderousse				129.3315256722688
endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the equal of the ablest intriguers he remained an honest man				211.3967875911218
madame de saint méran has arrived and her husband is dead m de saint méran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of friendship still the death of one old man always considerably affects another				764.9223477840268
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes and she ordered kitty to come at nine o clock in the morning to take a third letter				723.7961916774724
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine no				659.3838432209899

he criticised everybody humorously				837267.1256826197
this time it was not a wandering troop of partisans it was an entire army				2620.7812550117887
let us save ourselves at these words she passed her arm under that of d artagnan and urged him forward eagerly				3524.5973322853242
should our bark be upset we are five of us good swimmers able enough to turn it over again or if not to hold on by it				92.63698155648382
d artagnan then thought of that cottage silent and obscure which had no doubt seen all and could tell its tale				277962.6637757726
if there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban or an aunt with a bird of paradise				18591.656388504314
we must go and look for them all right said athos				14.51612451348745

the host who saw two young noblemen richly clad promised everything they required and our two cavaliers after seeing that preparations for the reception were actually begun started off again and proceeded rapidly toward greney				74432.3281910069
but the chevalier was himself at heart a frondist and would hear nothing said of compensation				148507.25503583925
haydée looked up abruptly as if the sonorous tones of monte cristo s voice had awakened her from a dream and she resumed her narrative				12723.648803337295
i am hungry feed me i am bored amuse me it is my duty as your host returned albert ringing the bell while lucien turned over with his gold mounted cane the papers that lay on the table				686.2211364342429
the examination chapter				316.695960885401

i was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible scene which was about to take place				884.170439518179
mazarin gave however no order of the kind but on the contrary began to be insinuating				404402.4347439183
scarcely had the two frenchmen touched the ground when a door opened and the voice of the valet de chambre called out make ready at the same moment the guardhouse was opened and a voice called out la bruyere and du barthois				417587.0666567359

have you seen him i left him five days ago said d artagnan and he portrayed with gascon wit and sprightliness the magnificence of porthos in his chateau of pierrefonds nor did he neglect to launch a few arrows of wit at the excellent monsieur mouston				18686.48903622038
is the deed of sale ready yes count have you brought it here it is very well and where is this house that i purchase asked the count carelessly addressing himself half to bertuccio half to the notary				2918.621156759394
let us now go into the adjoining chamber which is your apartment and ali will bring us coffee and pipes they both arose and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his guest have some title by which to distinguish him gave some orders to the servant franz entered still another apartment				693.7167341066678
i should dread some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home be easy				1421.7171299706645
